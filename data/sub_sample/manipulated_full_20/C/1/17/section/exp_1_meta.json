                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n        a. One bed, or folding cot,\n        b. One oil stove,\n        c. One lamp,\n        d. Enough supplies of all kinds sufficient for six months,\n        e. Pots, pans, kettles, etc.\nIt is needless to say that positions in Manila and Iloilo were now at\na premium.\n\nWas it possible that teachers were to be sent to places where even the\nnecessaries of life could not be obtained! Was it possible that many\nwould be sent to places so remote that for six months no fresh\nsupplies could be gotten! A mass meeting was held at once, and a\ncommittee was appointed to send a cablegram to the Associated Press\npetitioning aid from the American people at large. Realizing what\nconsternation would be created throughout the United States by such a\nmessage, two of the teachers leaped into a carriage at the close of\nthe meeting and a few moments later were closeted with the chief\nexecutive of the department. As a result the committee was persuaded\nnot to send the cablegram to the Associated Press until by courtesy it\nhad been sent to the President. Of course, this diplomatic move tided\naffairs over and the teachers who had flatly refused to budge from\nManila now agreed to go on to their stations, being assured that\nwhatever action was best would be taken.\n\nThe day had come when we must separate. We were to enter an untried\nand an unknown field. It was fitting that we have a final joyous\nmeeting, so the best orchestra in the archipelago was engaged and we\n\"chased the hours with flying feet\" until dawn so that whatever might\ncome to us in that unknown future upon which we were entering each\nwould hold in pleasant memory our last evening together.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER III. - A DRAMA IN ACTUAL LIFE.\n\n\nAlmost every one heeded the warning to go to his station forearmed\nwith at least necessaries of life, but, as it had never fallen to the\nlot of the writer to cook, he refused to learn at that late day, so he\ntook no pot, no pan, no kettle, putting his future into the hands of\nan uncertain fate and relying upon the unknown hospitality of the\nFilipino.\n\nBacalod, the capital of the province of Occidental Negros, was our\ndestination. The second morning after leaving Manila, we awoke with\nthe \"Kilpatrick\" lying at anchor in a shallow bay. We were several\nmiles from the shore and nothing in sight indicated that we had\nreached a place of any importance. Late the night before we had been\nawakened by the loud, sharp ringing of the ship's bells, accompanied\nby the reversal of the engines and a general disturbance awaking the\ncrew. So our first impressions on coming on deck were that we had run\naground. But the captain assured us that everything was ship-shape and\nthat this was the nearest point of approach to Capiz, a town of\nconsiderable importance on the island of Panay, where a body of troops\nwas to embark for home. Not even the grass hut of a native was in\nsight. Search as we would, not a sign was seen of a stream flowing\ninto the sea, indicating the probable presence of a town. There was\nnot a sign of life of any kind save one lone column of thin, blue\nsmoke that arose from the side of a mountain miles away. One would\nhave thought that we were explorers of three hundred years ago lying\noff the shore of some unknown land.\n\nAfter breakfast the steam launch, together with all the boats, was\nlowered, and several of us who had determined to miss no opportunity\nto gather information about the islands took our places in the launch\nby the side of the ship's mate, and steamed away across the water with\na long line of boats strung out in the rear. We headed away toward a\ngroup of cocoanut trees, and about an hour later stepped ashore on a\npile of decayed coral rocks that extended some twenty or thirty feet\nout into the water, thus forming the only landing place of a town of\nseveral thousands of people and of considerable commercial importance.\n\nA few moments after we had landed, an army wagon drawn by a\nmagnificent pair of mules came up out of a tropical jungle along a\nnarrow road. We clambered into the wagon and were soon lost in the\ndepths of foliage from which we had just seen the vehicle emerge.\n\nLong waving bamboos with their plumy leafage hung over the road from\neach side, meeting and overlapping in the center until they formed an\narchway so dense that the tropical sun now high in the heavens\npenetrated it only at intervals. At times the wagon sank up to the\nhubs in the soft earth, and the muscles of the mules stood out like\nwhip-cords under the skin as they drew us forward.\n\nAt a sharp turn in the road we came upon the first division of troops\nthat was to embark for home. The look of joy upon their sun-browned\nfaces was inexpressible. Their work was done, and with elastic step\nand smiling faces they saluted us as they passed by. The reign of\nforce was at an end; it was going out with them; the reign of peace\nhad begun; it was coming in with us.\n\nIn the afternoon when we returned from the town the last of the troops\nhad arrived and, as we drove up, the bugle was sounding the call to\nsupper. We noticed native women mingling with the troops and, indeed,\na native woman was in constant attention waiting upon one of the\nsoldiers with whom we ate. Her clothes were clean, her hair was nicely\ncombed, and her general appearance was neat. She seemed to anticipate\nthe slightest wish of the soldier with whom she was. She brought him\nwater to drink, cleaned his plate after the meal and saw that his\nknife, fork, and spoon were put into his haversack.\n\nWe had now finished supper and the launch had returned for the last\nload of troops. The lieutenant in command of the company gave the\norder to \"fall in\"; the men shouldered their rifles and fell into\nline. \"Forward, march!\" called the lieutenant, and the column swept\nforward towards the boats. The women had until now restrained\nthemselves, but, as their husbands marched away never to return, their\nfeelings could no longer be restrained. One young woman of about\neighteen, who was leaning against a rock by the roadside sobbing, when\nher husband passed, leaped up in frenzy of passionate love and caught\nthe rifle from his shoulder. Her first impulse seemed to be to throw\nthe gun away, but suddenly realizing the futility of such an act she\nburst into tears, shouldered the rifle herself and marched on by his\nside. Another woman of more mature age threw her arms around the legs\nof a tall stalwart man, and drew him bodily from the line.\n\nBut the troops marched on and entered the boats. One woman who had\nbeen unnoticed before came down into the shallow water and caught hold\nof our last boat as if to prevent its leaving, while others stood\nmingling their sobs with the sounds of the wavelets as they broke on\nthe sands. As we passed away, an expectant mother, standing in bold\noutline against the twilight sky, threw up her hands in an agony of\ndespair and then sank upon the stones. The curtain had fallen upon a\ndrama in actual life deeper in pathos than any other we had ever seen\nor ever expected to see. Depth of passion, depth of love! Who can\nfathom the human heart?\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. - WHAT THE TEACHERS DID.\n\n\nThere is a remarkable sameness about the towns in the Philippines.\n\nThey all have a large open square about the middle of the town, around\nthree sides of which are Chinese stores, unless one side lies open to\nthe sea, and on the fourth is the great stone ecclesia. The streets\nrun at right angles to one another and divide up the town into\ncreditable squares.\n\nEverybody in the Philippines lives up-stairs, for the ground is so\nsoaked with water during the rainy season that it is a menace to\nhealth to live upon the ground floor. So even the poorest nippa hut\nis built upon stakes four or five feet above the ground.\n\nBacalod is a typical Philippine town. As we landed, a broad open\nsquare was spread out before us. Two sides of the square were lined\nwith two-story houses in which were Chinese stores below and Filipino\nhomes above. On the third side stood the great stone church in whose\nmassive tower the clock was striking the hour of four, while the\nfourth lay open to the sea that had borne us thither.\n\nWe landed, but it was in a method new to us and one not usually\nemployed by the traveling public.\n\nWhen our sail boat ran aground on the sandy bottom a hundred yards or\nmore from the shore, a crowd of Filipino men who were on the beach\nslowly rolled up their pantaloons and waded out to the rescue,--for\nthe money that was in it. The boat's crew elevated their trousers'\nlegs also and slided down into the water. Each of us then straddled\nthe neck of a Filipino standing in the water and was held by ankles to\nbe steadied while our biped mounts proceeded to the shore.\n\nWe were now on the ground and face to face with the situation. To give\nthe reader an idea of the actual conditions met by the first teachers\nwho went to the Islands, the following is copied from the instructions\ngiven us in Manila:\n    1. There shall be two sessions daily of all schools, and the\n    last hour of the morning session shall be devoted solely to\n    instructing the Filipino teachers.\n\n    2. In cases where teachers are sent to a town in which there\n    is no school-house, they are expected to secure the aid of the\n    people and have one built.\n\n    3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is\n    stopped.\n\n    4. All supplies must be kept under lock and key. In towns\n    where there is no case or box to lock the supplies in, and it\n    is also impossible to get the town council to furnish a case,\n    a requisition may be sent to Manila, and, if an appropriation\n    can be secured, one will be made and sent out.\n\nThus it can be easily seen that we were indeed pioneers. In many\nplaces no school-house was to be found, and in some cases it was even\ndifficult to get the town council to provide a case in which to keep\nthe supplies.\n\nThe work of the teachers was, in short; to \"make the English language\nthe basis of instruction in the public schools.\" On our arrival at\nBacalod two schools were found in progress, for some soldiers had been\ndetailed for the work here previous to our coming. One of these was\nfor boys and the other, for girls. Thus the work here had been in a\nmeasure simplified, but complications that had arisen at Talisay, one\nof the largest and richest towns on the island, demanded a change of\nteachers and the writer was assigned to the place as superintendent.\n\nHere an attempt had been made to start a school but it had failed\nignominiously and a system of education was to be put into operation\nfrom the very start.\n\nThe Filipinos are not strong advocates of co-education, so separate\nschools were to be started for the boys and the girls. The one for the\nboys was gotten well in hand before the one for the girls was\nattempted at all.\n\nA few days after reaching the town and securing a home the\npresidente of the town had it publicly announced that the following\nMonday morning at eight o'clock a public school for boys would be\nopened in a building that had been rented for the purpose by the\nmunicipal council. About the middle of the afternoon of the same day a\nman beat a little drum throughout all the streets of the town to call\nthe people out and the town clerk announced both in Spanish and in the\nnative language that this public school would begin at the time and\nplace mentioned above; that instruction would be free to all who came;\nthat the government would furnish all supplies; and that instruction\nwould be given in the English language. A native principal and\nassistants were employed and everything was ready to begin.\n\nThe official report of the result is as follows:\n    Boys' public school of Talisay, Negros, P. I., began November\n    4, 1901. Forty-three boys present at eight o'clock. Forty-one\n    of them knew \"good morning\" and \"good afternoon\" but do not\n    know the distinction between them. Two of them speak simple\n    Spanish. At eight forty-five, eight more, who had been\n    attending an early morning private school, came in together.\n\n    The books they brought were so varied and so different from\n    one another that it seemed impossible to bring any reasonable\n    degree of order out of such a chaos, and so, after struggling\n    vainly for about a week with the problem, the superintendent\n    by one fell stroke removed everything in use and put in a\n    uniform system, and from that day on the English language has\n    been the basis of instruction in the public schools of\n    Talisay. The work was of necessity very slow at first, but by\n    the end of a year two schools were going nicely and a number\n    of the brightest boys and girls had made really excellent\n    progress.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER V. - A \"BAILE.\"\n\n\nNot long after the arrival of our party at Bacalod we received an\ninvitation to a \"baile\" given in our honor by the inhabitants of\nSilay, a town some ten or twelve miles up the northern coast and one\nnoted for its social life. The invitation was accepted with pleasure,\nand about the middle of the afternoon on the day appointed we were\nclad in the immaculate white of the tropics and steaming away up the\ncoast on board a launch sent for our conveyance. Twilight was still\nlingering on the path of day when we anchored just off shore at the\ntown. A row-boat containing the officials of the city came out to meet\nus and, in due season, we were ushered into a spacious drawing-room\nfilled almost to overflowing with the \u00e9lite of the town. The \u00e9lite of\ntowns in the Philippines speak Spanish, and, as only one or two of our\nparty could at that time boast of more than a formal acquaintance with\nthe Castilian tongue, the exchange of ideas that evening between us\nand the Filipinos was of necessity not very rapid.\n\nThe necessity of easy communication between us was rendered somewhat\nless indispensable by the announcement of supper as soon as we were\nrested from our trip. When we had taken our places at the table a\nyoung Filipino about twenty-five years of age arose and gave a lengthy\ntoast to the recent union of the Philippines with the United States.\n\nBut as we Americans were unable to scale the dizzy heights of his\nclimaxes or sink to the depths of his pathos, we forewent the\npleasures of his oratory and turned our attention to the savory odor\nof lamb, chicken, and roast pig that came slyly stealing up our\nnostrils to send us nerve dispatches about the gastronomic delights of\nour not far distant future.\n\nAt last the toast was ended and the world-wide soup ushered in a long\ntrain of things good to eat, served in a style better fitted to the\ndelights of the appetite than to the formalities of dinners, for, as\nsoon as the pleasant task of one dish was completed by any one, the\nnext was served him at once regardless of the progress made by the\nothers at the table.\n\nThe last course was dulce. The new-comers to the Philippines will\nnot be long in making the acquaintance of this dish, and at all\nmeetings, both public and private, where eatables are served, it\nperforms an important part. It is anything sweet, and it may vary all\nthe way from an india-rubber-like black mixture of cocoanut milk and\ndirty sugar to a really toothsome and respectable confection. No\nmatter of what materials a dish is composed, just so long as it is\nsweet, it is dulce.\n\nAfter paying our respects to this last course, we arose from the table\nand entered a great rectangular room from the center of whose ceiling\nhung a large glass chandelier, a mass of shimmering crystals. In the\nchairs around the room were the wealth, the youth, and the beauty of\nthe town.\n\nThe first and also the last number of every Filipino dance of any\nformality is the \"rigodon.\" The dancers are arranged in a square, or\nquadrangle according to the number participating, and are then led\nthrough a tangled maze of figures that so utterly bewilders the novice\nthat he sinks into his chair at the end of the dance wondering how it\nall came to pass.\n\nWe Americans breathed a sigh of relief when the \"rigodon\" ended, and\nmustered fresh courage for social conquests in the waltz that was now\nbreathing forth from the trembling strings. My companion in the first\ndance had been the young lady by whose side I had sat at dinner. But\nit now became necessary to search for another, so I prudently waited\nto see how partners were chosen, and made no mistake when a few\nmoments later I faced one of the most luscious looking se\u00f1oritas on\nthe opposite side of the room and offered her my arm. My eyes must\nhave told the story that my lips could not utter in Spanish, for she\nsmiled upon me sweetly, arose, and put her hand upon my shoulder. My\narm encircled her waist and I began to waltz. Unfortunately my\ncompanion did not follow, but began to hop up and down in a manner\nmost distressing. Supposing the attack to be only temporary, I paused\nand, much to my relief, she soon showed signs of recovery; and in the\ncourse of time she came to a standstill looking up into my face in an\ninquiring sort of way, apparently wondering why St. Vitus had not paid\nhis respects to me also. A second attempt to follow the music met with\nresults similar to the first, and during the third attempt, which\nseemed to be trembling on the verge of a failure, St. Vitus let go my\ncompanion and seized me with such vigor that she, who was small even\nfor a Filipino, was gathered up bodily and taken around the room at\nsuch a pace that her toes touched the floor only at far distant\nintervals.\n\nAt this point my devotion to the shrine of Terpsichore ceased from\nforce of circumstances and I seated myself in one of the most\ncomfortable chairs in sight that I might carry out a previously formed\nplan to study the Filipino somewhat critically as he appears in\nsociety.\n\nThe first thing that impressed me as the dancers passed up and down\nthe room was the flash of diamonds. Nearly every woman in the room had\non a brooch that flashed the colors of the rainbow at every turn.\n\nAlmost all of them wore one or more rings that showed up brilliantly\nunder the chandelier. Many of the men too, especially the young men,\nwore gems that appeared to be exquisite. A closer inspection showed\nthat some of the gems had flaws and others were of a poor color, but\nno one would have denied that, taken as a whole, it was a really\nbeautiful display.\n\nThe dress of the ladies was richly colored. Many of their skirts were\nof silk covered with hand embroidered flowers, and their filmy pina\nwaists and broad collar pieces were rich with needle-work. They all\nwore a kind of heelless velvet slipper, very common as a dress shoe in\nthe Philippines, or high-heeled patent leather shoes with neatly\nfitting black stockings.\n\nThe men were dressed in white coats and white pantaloons or black\ncoats and white pantaloons. White shirts and collars, together with\nall sorts and styles of cravats and low-cut patent leather shoes with\nhighly colored socks completed their dress.\n\nIt was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money;\nthat they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a\ntable loaded with good things was a fact to which all of us were\nenthusiastic witnesses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VI. - A SKETCH OF LIFE IN THE PHILIPPINES.\n\n\nHouse-keeping in the Philippines presents some interesting phases. Our\nclub of American officials decided to run a mess, so we employed a\ncook and a house boy, then each of us provided himself with a personal\nservant, making a total of six servants for four men--it takes about\nthis proportion of servants to live in any sort of comfort in the\nPhilippines--and launched ourselves boldly upon the sea of domestic\neconomy. But there were shoals ahead of us, for the question of\nregulating servants is one of no small importance in the Philippines,\nand one of its most disadvantageous features is the long chain of\ndependents that usually attends it.\n\nWe gave the cooks so much a day with which to buy supplies in the\nlocal market, for our own table, making him render a daily list of\nexpenditures, and a fixed amount besides to purchase rice and fish for\nhimself and the other servants. Of course, if they wished to vary\ntheir diet and get chicken and fresh pork, which could be had at far\ndistant intervals, it was wholly a matter of their option, but the\nallowance was made on the basis of so much rice and fish a day for\neach. This allowance was about fifteen cents a day in Spanish coin per\nservant.\n\nThus far all was well. We had agreed to give the cook eight dollars a\nmonth in Spanish money, thinking that good wages would procure good\nservice, but the visions of affluence that floated before him on such\nfloods of wealth were so alluring that they drew him from the kitchen\nto the cooler veranda. In less than a week he had employed an\nassistant at four dollars a month; in less than another week that\nassistant had employed him an assistant at two dollars a month; in\nless than another week that assistant to the assistant had employed\nhim an assistant at the princely salary of fifty cents a month; and\nfrom fear that the chain of dependents would end only by our having\nthe whole Filipino race attached to our culinary force, we broke up\nhouse-keeping and went boarding again, choosing that as the less of\nthe two evils.\n\nOur house furnishings were almost wholly Philippine. The table ware\nand the food on the table came from the ends of the earth. The knives\nand forks were made in Germany, the plates were manufactured in\nEngland, the glass ware and table cloth, in the United States. The\noatmeal and flour came from the United States also. The butter came\nfrom Australia, the rice from China, the salt from Russia, and the\nother eatables from sources about as various as their separate names.\n\nSwitzerland furnished the condensed milk and Illinois the canned\ncream. Nearly all of the canned fruit bore labels from Spain.\n\nThus it can easily be seen that life in the Philippines, if lived\naccording to American ideals, is dependent upon a highly developed and\nhighly complex commerce. However, the difficulties of transportation\nand the restriction of large stocks of merchandise to Manila and some\nhalf a dozen other towns, make so great a difference between country\nlife and city life that a short comparison of the two will not be out\nof place, and life in Manila may well be taken as being fairly typical\nof the latter.\n\nLife in Manila is pleasant, but expensive. It is pleasant from the\nfact that it is not only the capital but also metropolis of the\narchipelago. Thus the combination of wealth and high official position\nhas given to Manila a society of the highest and most refined type.\n\nThe process of beautifying and improving the city which is constantly\ngoing on bids fair to give us at no distant day a city of which we may\nwell be proud.\n\nBut let him who intends living well in Manila on a small income bid\nfarewell at once to so idylic a dream, for it costs much to live well\nthere. In the city of Manila one can get almost anything he wishes,\nbut it must be paid for at the price it commands. Especially in the\ncase of eatables, this price is by no means small, because to the\nfirst cost of articles must in most cases be added the expense of\ndistant shipment from American, European, or Australian ports, and not\ninfrequently the cost of long refrigeration must also be taken into\nconsideration. But, expensive though it is, it is very pleasant to\nlive there and those who have once enjoyed it often wish again to\nquaff the cup of its delights.\n\nIn strong contrast to this pleasant life is the life of the quiet\nlittle hamlet away in the distant islands. Indeed, the Filipino from\nthe distant town, who by some good fortune has been to Manila, or, by\na coup de main, has studied in one of the Manila colleges, is looked\nup to in a true hero-worshiping attitude by all who either know him or\nhear of his fame. Life in such a place is one long state of harmless\ninactivity. Not a wave of trouble from the great outer world ever\ndisturbs its peaceful repose. One lounges forever in an air of\nindolent ease and extreme aversion to anything approaching what might\nbe called a respectable effort.\n\nOne arises in the morning about the time the sun's first rays silver\nthe top leaves of the cocoanut trees and then stirs around until nine\nor ten o'clock, when it is found expedient to avoid a further exposure\nto the sun. From then until about five o'clock in the afternoon it is\nbest to take things as they come, even though one of those things be a\nFilipino dinner. But then you may have your vehiclo attached to a\nyoung bull with a ring in his nose and go for a drive. If it is the\ndry season you will probably enjoy the drive unless you object to the\nfrequent clouds of dust swept along by the evening wind. If it is in\nthe rainy season your pleasure will depend to a considerable extent\nupon how wet you get; but, whether the season be wet or dry, your\npleasure will be regulated largely by the state of harmony existing\nbetween the driver and the bull.\n\nIn these quiet secluded nooks successive generations of Filipinos are\nborn, reared, grow old and die in an even chain of events broken only\nby the occasional erection of a new grass house on the identical spot\nwhere its predecessors have stood for ages. The son lives in the house\nof his father, cultivates the same few square feet of soil planted in\nedible roots, climbs the same cocoanut trees, follows the same winding\npath down to the stream, pounds rice in the same mortar and with the\nsame stick that his ancestors have used from time unremembered, and,\nin case of illness, curls up on a grass mat in a corner of the room\nuntil he dies or by some good fortune recovers. Beyond this narrow\nhorizon he never looks. So narrow and contracted is the life that the\nlanguages of two towns a few miles apart are so different that one\nwould scarcely recognize them as belonging to the same race of people.\n\nSuch are the two extremes of life in our new far Eastern provinces:\nthe one is active, progressive, and cosmopolitan; the other, inactive,\ndecadent, and narrow; but, whether one enjoys the first or endures the\nsecond, there comes to him after leaving a longing to lounge again in\ntropic airs and listen to the lullaby of the winds among the palms.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VII. - THE FILIPINO AT HOME.\n\n\nAs one enters a Filipino sitting-room for the first time, there is one\nfeature in the arrangement of the furniture that impresses itself upon\nhim at once, and it may be stated without fear of serious\ncontradiction that this same peculiar feature in its arrangement will\ncontinue to face him, as he enters different homes, about as certainly\nas he crosses the threshold.\n\nThe arrangement referred to is that of one large mirror, one settee,\nand some ten or a dozen chairs that appear to have had a certain\norderly affection for one another. The mirror is hung upon one of the\nlarge interior parts of the house about four feet above the floor. The\nwooden houses in the Philippines are built by setting large posts\nupright into the ground, extending into the air from twenty to thirty\nfeet. Cross timbers are fastened to these upright posts about eight or\nten feet above the ground and then not sawed off even with the posts,\nbut allowed to extend beyond them each way. The framework of the house\nis built upon these extending cross timbers, a style of building by\nwhich these large upright posts are left standing out on the inside of\nthe room from one to three feet from the walls. It is on that one of\nthese posts most nearly opposite the door that the mirror always finds\nits place. Immediately beneath the mirror is the settee; and the\nchairs are arranged in two parallel lines facing one another and at\nright angles with the ends of the settee. However odd this arrangement\nmay appear to one when he first enters a Filipino drawing-room, there\nare two things to be said in its favor. In the first place, it places\nyou face to face with the person with whom you are conversing so that\nyou can watch him,--a matter of no small moment in the Philippines. In\nthe next place, it enables you to give one of the young ladies a\nsheep's-eye in the mirror while the others present are left where\nMoses was in our much abused conundrum.\n\nThe size of the residence and the quality of its furnishings depends\nupon the wealth of the owner. But there is so vast a difference\nbetween the mode of life of the highest class and the tao, or lowest\nclass, that it is well to speak of them separately, and the great\nmiddle class of Filipinos can easily be imagined to occupy the\nintervening ground.\n\nThe rich Filipino's house is usually of wood built upon a wall of\nstone or brick from ten to fifteen feet high. The floors are kept\nhighly polished in his hallway, dressing-room, and bed-rooms. There\nare, of course, no fire-places in any of the rooms, but on some\noccasions something is needed to dry the rain-soaked atmosphere, for\neven in the dry season it has been seen to rain for five successive\ndays and nights without the cessation of a moment.\n\nA long chain of dependents is attached to the household of the rich\nFilipino. The master has his special body servant to be present at all\ntimes to do his master's bidding, in short, to be the visible\nmechanism of his master's volition. So, too, the lady of the house has\nher servant woman to do the slightest bidding of her ladyship. Then\nthere is the cook who is almost invariably a man, a house boy or two,\nand the coachman. These functionaries, with their assistants and\nassistants to the assistants, together with a servant or two for the\nexclusive service of the children, complete the economic household.\n\nSuch a family has an abundance of rice and wheat bread, also of\nchicken and fish with occasional fresh beef. They have also a good\ndeal of dulce. They regularly serve wine and frequently serve beer\non their tables.\n\nIn strong contrast with this mode of life is that of the tao. His\ndiet consists almost wholly of rice and small uncleaned fish boiled\ntogether. As a rule knife, fork, plate, and spoon find no place in his\nhousehold. The rice and fish are boiled in a pot and then allowed to\ncool in the same vessel or poured out to cool in a large earthen or\nwooden bowl. Then Mr. Tao together with Mrs. Tao and all the young\nTaos squat on their heels around the mixture and satisfy that\nintangible thing called the appetite. They do not use chop sticks as\nthe Chinese do, but the rice and fish are caught in a hollow formed by\nthe first three fingers of the right hand. The thumb is then placed\nbehind the mass. It is raised up and poised before the mouth, with a\nskill coming from the evolution of ages, when a contraction of the\nmuscles of the thumb throws the mass into the mouth with a skill that\nis marvelous to any but a Filipino. To judge from the most reliable\ninformation, the poorest class do not have an abundance of food,\nalthough it would seem that such a condition of things would be\nwell-nigh impossible. However, in a census of one hundred school\nchildren there were found six boys and four girls who declared that\nthey had never had enough to eat, and the native teacher stated that\nthis was probably true.\n\nThe wide gulf between the tao and the rich man is filled by the\ngreat middle class of Filipinos.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VIII. - VISIT TO A LEPER COLONY.\n\n\nNot far from our town was a leper colony and the first Saturday that\ncould be spared was set aside for a trip to the place. It happened\nthat none of the other Americans were at leisure on this particular\nmorning, but, rather then delay the trip or miss it altogether, the\nwriter, armed with a revolver, started out alone.\n\nThe road had been described so accurately by one who was supposed to\nknow it that it was deemed well-nigh impossible to miss the way. The\nmain highway was followed to the point where the by-path supposed to\nlead to the settlement turned off through some bamboo thickets and a\nlow tropical wood. This path led straight away towards the sea-coast\nwhere the houses of the colony were said to stand in a cocoanut grove\nby the beach.\n\nUpon arriving at the settlement, a very inhospitable reception was\nreceived from a mangy cur that growled and showed a very uninviting\nset of sharp, white teeth behind his snarling lips. The growling of\nthe dog had attracted the attention of an old man who, with age-bent\nback, was pounding rice in a mortar about fifty yards away. He turned\nslowly around and, upon seeing an intruder into the primitive quiet of\nthe place, gave a sharp, far-reaching call. The sound had scarcely\nrung through the grove when from about a dozen of the little grass\nhouses dotted here and there fifteen or twenty men armed with bolos\ncame out and gathered around the old man. A sense of my danger flashed\nupon me. Three miles from town and alone in a tropical jungle, I could\nbe almost instantly overcome by this band of bolo-men, and the only\nreport that would ever reach my people would be that I had\n\"disappeared.\" Of course, attack was by no means certain, but the\npotentiality of the situation was thrilling. A drawn revolver and the\ngleaming of its shining barrel had the effect of stopping the men, who\nseemed to be hesitating as to a course of action, until a somewhat\ndignified retreat was made to an open space in the rear from where a\nless dignified and a more hasty retreat began which did not stop short\nof Bacalod.\n\nEnough had been seen, however, even in this short visit, to give\nconvincing proof that the settlement visited was no colony of lepers;\nso, that afternoon two servant boys being taken as guides and\ninterpreters, another attempt was made to reach the goal desired.\n\nThis attempt was successful, and, after about two hours of walking, a\nlittle cluster of grass huts snugly hidden by the sea-coast came into\nview. As we approached, one would have thought it a gala-day. Some few\nchildren, apparently from six to thirteen years of age, almost wholly\nnude, were romping and playing in the open space around which the huts\nstood, and no one would ever have thought that any cloud so horrible\nas leprosy could hover over a place apparently so happy.\n\nBy the side of the path as we passed was a man and his wife setting\nout potato plants. His hands were so puffed and his fingers so short\nthat he could scarcely use them, but he was working along as best he\ncould. His wife's feet were so swollen and twisted that she walked\nonly with the greatest difficulty. We passed them by and entered the\nopen space above referred to.\n\nThe children now saw us, and those of them who could darted away like\nfrightened rabbits, each to his own burrow. An old man who was sitting\nin the warm afternoon sun on the little bamboo platform before his hut\nwas aroused from his lethargic repose by the scampering away of the\nchildren. He arose, trembling upon his tottering limbs, all drawn and\ntwisted, and hobbled away into his hut.\n\nThe children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at\nthe doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of\nthe settlement. In a few moments we were surrounded by a circle of\nhuman beings at once so repulsive and so pitiable that its graphic\nvividness can never be accurately portrayed.\n\nThe old man referred to above, having put on a pair of snow-white\npantaloons, appeared now at the doorway of his hut, followed a few\nmoments later by his wife who had evidently clothed herself in the\nbest raiment she had. At a call from the old man, all the men, women,\nand children in the settlement came out of their huts and stood in a\nline before us. The old man was spokesman and in his native visayan\ntongue made a heart-rending appeal for aid which we were powerless to\ngive. Attention was called to a leper woman, apparently about\ntwenty-five years of age, whose face had been attacked by the disease\nand whose appearance was truly pathetic. Upon her hip was a child\nabout a year and a half old and, strange to say, the child showed as\nyet no signs whatever of the disease.\n\nWhat an indissoluble enigma is life! Here in a little cluster of grass\nhuts in a secluded nook of a secluded island of an all but secluded\narchipelago was gathered together a little community of wretched\nnatives, driven by their loathsomeness from association with others\neven of the same half-savage race. Yet here, men and women loved and\nwere married, by mutual trust if not by law, and children were born of\nthe union to live forever under the unspeakable horror that\novershadowed the unfortunate parents. Love, hatred, sorrow, and\njoy--every passion that enters into the complex structure of the human\nheart even here, in this scene of sadness and despair, was playing\napparently as freely as where misfortune and disease had never crossed\nthe portals of life.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER IX. - A \"HIKE.\"\n\n\nWe were lounging lazily in our hammocks at Jimamaylan one evening in\nApril. Supper was just ended, and the soldiers in the post were\ncollected in groups here and there spinning yarns to pass away the\ntime, when a Filipino clad only in a loin cloth came down the street\nat a steadily swinging run and stopped in front of the sentry. He\nbrought the announcement that a band of ladrones had just burned a\nsugar mill and were advancing to sack a barrio about fifteen miles\naway.\n\nThe invitation of the commanding officer to go on a \"hike\" was eagerly\naccepted, and, in ten minutes after the message was given, the troops\nwere on the march followed by two adventurous pedagogues.\n\nDarkness was just closing in as we left the town, but a resplendent\ntropic moon soon made the night almost as brilliant as the day. The\ntrail we followed led over rough and rocky country. Sometimes for a\ndistance of a mile or more we passed over barren wastes of volcanic\nslag poured out in anger by some peak whose convulsions have long\nsince ceased. Again we would descend into a tropical jungle from the\ndense foliage of which the ladrones could have leaped at any moment,\nhad they known of our coming, and annihilated our little band. We\nforded rapid streams with the water at our breasts, and halted only\nonce in that rapid march of fifteen miles.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the town we met a man who was standing\nguard against a surprise by the ladrones. Nothing could well have been\nmuch more grotesque and nothing could much better illustrate the\nabsolutely primitive condition of the Filipinos in the interior of the\nislands than the appearance of this guard. A pair of knee pants, a\nconical grass hat, and a hemp shirt formed his entire apparel. A long\nflat wooden shield, a bolo, and a long bamboo spear with a sharp,\nflat, iron point, completed his equipment for battle.\n\nHere stood the first and the twentieth centuries side by side. The\nFilipino who had advanced only a stage beyond the condition of\nprimitive man with his knife, spear, and wooden shield, stood side by\nside with the American soldier, a representative of modern life with\nhis magazine rifle, his canteen, his knapsack,--with every article of\nhis clothing made to give him the highest possible efficiency as the\nunit of a military organization.\n\nA few yards farther on we met another guard equipped similarly to the\nfirst. Upon reaching the town, news had just been received that a\ndetachment of troops from another post had intercepted the ladrones\nand fought a skirmish with them. The ladrones had escaped and we set\nout in pursuit of them on a chase wilder than a Quixotic dream. We\nwound our way into the mountains behind the town, inquiring at every\ngrass hut we passed whether the band of ladrones had passed that way,\nbut only once was even a trace of them found. Then it was learned that\nat a certain place they had separated into groups of three or four and\ngone glimmering through the dream of things that were. This place was\nin a secluded nook of the mountains where in years gone by some\nadventurous Spaniard had erected a primitive water mill to grind his\nsugar-cane. We had now marched about twenty miles and the feet of the\npedagogues were a mass of blisters. They had reached the point where\nthat form of military maneuvering called \"hiking\" ceased to possess\nany alluring charms. So a native was persuaded to come out of his lone\nmountain hut and hitch up his carabao and cart. He was then made to\nget on the carabao's back, while the aforesaid pedagogues lay down on\nthe sugar-cane pulp that had been put into the body of the cart, and\nthe driver was instructed to start for the post we had left hours\nbefore, and not to stop until he got there. Being uncertain but that\nsome of the ladrones would learn of our having left the body of troops\nand would try the metal of our steel, we at first agreed that neither\nof us should go to sleep, but it was later decided that probably the\ndriver had no greater desire to cross the Styx than his passengers had\nand that in case of danger he would awaken us, so both took a revolver\nin each hand, stretched out supinely and went to sleep.\n\nSuch a sleep! The rough jolting of the cart over an almost impassable\nroad was never enough to break the spell of slumber. When we awoke the\nblazing tropic sun was past the midday mark of morning, shining full\ninto our unprotected and well-nigh blistered faces.\n\nA pack of dogs were heralding our approach to a little village at the\nfoot of the mountains where ponies were procured to take us back to\nthe post.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he insists, \"have stood the test of ages; and the plant\nevery where retained its name and credit: and one of our good\nherbarists, who had seen a wonderful case of a swoln spleen, so big, and\nhard as to be felt with terror, brought back to a state of nature by it\"\n\n(p. 37). The greatest portion of Hill's concluding section combines\nadvertisement for the powder medicine he was himself manufacturing at a\nhandsome profit together with a protest against competing apothecaries:\n\"An intelligent person was directed to go to the medicinal herb shops in\nthe several markets, and buy some of this Spleen-wort; the name was\nwritten, and shewn to every one; every shop received his money, and\nalmost every one sold a different plant, under the name of this: but\nwhat is very striking, not one of them the right\" (p. 42).\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis did not cease to be printed after Hill's in\n1766, but continued to issue from the presses into the nineteenth\ncentury. A good example of this is the tome by John Reid, physician to\nthe Finsbury Dispensary in London, Essays on Insanity, Hypochondriasis\nand Other Nervous Affections (1816), which summarizes theories of the\nmalady. A bibliographical study of such works would probably reveal\na larger number of titles in the nineteenth century than in the previous\none, but by this time the nature and definition of hypochondria had\nchanged significantly.\n\nIf John Hill's volume is not an important contribution in the history of\nmedicine, it is a lucid and brief exposition of many of the best ideas\nthat had been thought and written on the hyp, with the exception of his\nuninhibited prescribing of herbal medicines as cure-alls. An\nunderstanding of this disease is essential for readers of neoclassical\nEnglish literature, especially when we reflect upon the fact that some\nof the best literature of the period was composed by writers whom it\nafflicted. It is perhaps not without significance that the greatest poet\nof the Augustan age, Alexander Pope, thought it necessary as he lay on\nhis deathbed in May 1744 to exclaim with his last breath, \"I never was\nhippish in my whole life.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. I. - The NATURE of the DISORDER.\n\n\nTo call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and cruel. It\nis a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by thickened\nand distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver, and other\nparts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick scarce knows\none more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\n\nThe blood is a mixture of many fluids, which, in a state of health, are\nso combined, that the whole passes freely through its appointed vessels;\nbut if by the loss of the thinner parts, the rest becomes too gross to\nbe thus carried through, it will stop where the circulation has least\npower; and having thus stopped it will accumulate; heaping by degrees\nobstruction on obstruction.\n\nHealth and chearfulness, and the quiet exercise of mind, depend upon a\nperfect circulation: is it a wonder then, when this becomes impeded the\nbody looses of its health, and the temper of its sprightliness? to be\notherwise would be the miracle; and he inhumanly insults the afflicted,\nwho calls all this a voluntary frowardness. Its slightest state brings\nwith it sickness, anguish and oppression; and innumerable ills follow\nits advancing steps, unless prevented by timely care; till life itself\ngrows burthensome.\n\nThe disease was common in antient Greece; and her physicians understood\nit, better than those perhaps of later times, in any other country; who\nthough happy in many advantages these fathers of the science could not\nhave, yet want the great assistance of frequent watching it in all its\nstages.\n\nThose venerable writers have delivered its nature, and its cure: in the\nfirst every thing now shews they were right; and what they have said as\nto the latter will be found equally true and certain. This, so far as\npresent experience has confirmed it, and no farther, will be here laid\nbefore the afflicted in a few plain words.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. II. - Persons Subject to it.\n\n\nFatigue of mind, and great exertion of its powers often give birth to\nthis disease; and always tend to encrease it. The finer spirits are\nwasted by the labour of the brain: the Philosopher rises from his study\nmore exhausted than the Peasant leaves his drudgery; without the benefit\nthat he has from exercise. Greatness of mind, and steady virtue;\ndetermined resolution, and manly firmness, when put in action, and\nintent upon their object, all also lead to it: perhaps whatever tends to\nthe ennobling of the soul has equal share in bringing on this weakness\nof the body.\n\nFrom this we may learn easily who are the men most subject to it; the\ngrave and studious, those of a sedate temper and enlarged understanding,\nthe learned and wise, the virtuous and the valiant: those whom it were\nthe interest of the world to wish were free from this and every other\nillness; and who perhaps, except for this alloy, would have too large a\nportion of human happiness.\n\nThough these are most, it is not these alone, who are subject to it.\n\nThere are countries where it is endemial, and in other places some have\nthe seeds of it in their constitution; and in some it takes rise from\naccidents. In these last it is the easiest of cure; and in the first\nmost difficult.\n\nBeside the Greeks already named, the Jews of old time were heavily\nafflicted with this disease; and in their descendants to this day it is\noften constitutional: the Spaniards have it almost to a man; and so have\nthe American Indians. Perhaps the character of these several nations may\nbe connected with it. The steady honour, and firm valour of the\nSpaniard, very like that of the ancient Doric nation, who followed the\nflute not the trumpet to the field; and met the enemy, not with shouts\nand fury, but with a determined virtue: it is the temper of the\nHypochondriac to be slow, but unmoveably resolved: the Jew has shewn\nthis mistakenly, but almost miraculously; and the poor Indian, untaught\nas he is, faces all peril with composure, and sings his death-song with\nan unalter'd countenance.\n\nAmong particular persons the most inquiring and contemplative are those\nwho suffer oftenest by this disease; and of all degrees of men I think\nthe clergy. I do not mean the hunting, shooting, drinking clergy, who\nbear the tables of the great; but the retir'd and conscientious; such as\nattend in midnight silence to their duty; and seek in their own cool\nbreasts, or wheresoever else they may be found, new admonitions for an\nage plunged in new vices. To this disease we owe the irreparable loss of\nDr. YOUNG; and the present danger of many other the best and most\nimproved amongst us. May what is here to be proposed assist in their\npreservation!\n\nThe Geometrician or the learned Philosopher of whatever denomination,\nwhose course of study fixes his eye for ever on one object, his mind\nintensely and continually employed upon one thought, should be warned\nalso that he is in danger; or if he find himself already afflicted, he\nshould be told that the same course of life, which brought it on, will,\nwithout due care, encrease it to the most dreaded violence.\n\nThe middle period of life is that in which there is the greatest danger\nof an attack from this disease; and the latter end of autumn, when the\nsummer heats have a little time been over, is the season when in our\nclimate its first assaults are most to be expected. The same time of the\nyear always increases the disorder in those who have been before\nafflicted with it; and it is a truth must be confessed, that from its\nfirst attack the patient grows continually, though slowly, worse; unless\na careful regimen prevent it.\n\nThe constitutions most liable to this obstruction are the lean, and dark\ncomplexioned; the grave and sedentary. Let such watch the first\nsymptoms; and obviate, (as they may with ease) that which it will be\nmuch more difficult to remove.\n\nIt is happy a disease, wherein the patient must do a great deal for\nhimself, falls, for the most part, upon those who have the powers of\nreason strongest. Let them only be aware of this, that the distemper\nnaturally disposes them to inactivity; and reason will have no use\nunless accompanied with resolution to enforce it.\n\nThough the physician can do something toward the cure, much more depends\nupon the patient; and here his constancy of mind will be employed most\nhappily. No one is better qualified to judge on a fair hearing what\ncourse is the most fit; and having made that choice, he must with\npatience wait its good effects. Diseases that come on slowly must have\ntime for curing; an attention to the first appearances of the disorder\nwill be always happiest; because when least established it is easiest\noverthrown: but when that happy period has been neglected, he must wait\nthe effects of such a course as will dilute and melt the obstructing\nmatter gradually; for till that be done it is not only vain, but\nsometimes dangerous, to attempt its expulsion from the body.\n\nThe blood easily separates itself into the grosser and the thinner\nparts: we see this in bleeding; and from the toughness of the red cake\nmay guess how very difficult it will be to dissolve a substance of like\nfirmness in the vessels of the body. That it can thus become thickened\nwithin the body, a Pleurisy shews us too evidently: in that case it is\nbrought on suddenly, and with inflammation; in this other, slowly and\nwithout; and here, even before it forms the obstruction, can bring on\nmany mischiefs. Various causes can produce the same effect, but that in\nall cases operates most durably, which operates most slowly. The watery\npart of the blood is its mild part; in the remaining gross matter of it,\nare acrid salts and burning oils, and these, when destitute of that\nhappy dilution nature gives them in a healthy body, are capable of doing\ngreat mischief to the tender vessels in which they are kept stagnant.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. III. - The SYMPTOMS of the DISORDER.\n\n\nThe first and lightest of the signs that shew this illness are a lowness\nof spirits, and inaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love\nof solitude and a habit of thinking, even on trifling subjects, with too\nmuch steadiness. A very little help may combat these: but if that\nindolence which is indeed a part of the disorder, will neglect them;\nworse must be expected soon to follow.\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness, weight, and oppression in the body,\na want of appetite, or, what is worse, an appetite without digestion;\nfor these are the conditions of different states of the disease, a\nfullness and a difficulty of breathing after meals, a straitness of the\nbreast, pains and flatulencies in the bowels, and an unaptness to\ndischarge their contents.\n\nThe pulse becomes low, weak, and unequal; and there are frequent\npalpitations of the heart, a little dark-coloured urine is voided at\nsome times; and a flood of colourless and insipid at others; relieving\nfor a moment, but increasing the distemper: there is in some cases also\na continual teazing cough, with a choaking stoppage in the throat at\ntimes; then heartburn, sickness, hardness of the belly, and a costive\nhabit, or a tormenting and vain irritation.\n\nThe lips turn pale, the eyes loose their brightness and by degrees the\nwhite grows as it were greenish, the gums want their due firmness, with\ntheir proper colour; and an unpleasing foulness grows upon the teeth:\nthe inside of the mouth is pale and furred, and the throat dry and\nhusky: the colour of the skin is pale (though there are periods when the\nface is florid) and as the obstruction gathers ground, and more affects\nthe liver, the whole body becomes yellow, tawny, greenish, and at length\nof that deep and dusky hue, to which men of swift imagination have given\nthe name of blackness.\n\nThese symptoms do not all appear in any one period of the disease, or in\none case, but at one time or other all of them, as well as those which\nfollow: the flesh becomes cold to the touch, though the patient does not\nhimself perceive it; the limbs grow numbed and torpid, the breathing\ndull and slow, and the voice hollow; and usually the appetite in this\nperiod declines, and comes almost to nothing: night sweats come on,\nblack swellings appear on the veins, the flesh wastes and the breast\nbecomes flat and hollow: the mouth is full of a thin spittle, the head\nis dizzy and confus'd, and sometimes there is an unconquerable numbness\nin the organs of speech.\n\nI have known the temporary silence that follows upon this last symptom\nbecome a jest to the common herd; and the unhappy patient, instead of\ncompassion and assistance, receive the reproof of sullenness, from those\nwho should have known and acted better.\n\nAbout twenty years ago I met on a visit at Catthorpe in Leicestershire a\nyoung gentleman of distinguished learning and abilities, who at certain\ntimes was speechless. The vulgar thought it a pretence: and a jocose\nlady, where he was at tea with company, putting him as she said to a\ntrial, poured out a dish very strong and without sugar. He drank it and\nreturned the cup with a bow of great reserve, and his eye bent on the\nground: she then filled the cup with sugar, and pouring weak tea on it,\nsent it him: he drank that too, looked at her steadily, and blushed for\nher. The lady declared the man was dumb; the rest thought him perverse,\nand obstinate; but a constant and steady perseverance in an easy method\ncured him.\n\nAll these are miseries which the disease, while it retains its natural\nform, can bring upon the patient; and thus he will in time be worn out,\nand led miserably, though slowly, to the grave. Let him not indulge his\ninactivity so far as to give way to this, because it is represented as\nfar off; the disease may suddenly and frightfully change its nature; and\nswifter evils follow.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. IV. - The DANGER.\n\n\nWe have done with the obstruction considered in itself; but this, though\noften unsurmountable by art, at least by the methods now in use, will be\nsometimes broken through at once by nature, or by accidents; and bring\non fatal evils. These are strictly different diseases, and are no\notherway concerned here, than as the consequences of that of which we\nare treating.\n\nThe thick and glutinous blood which has so long stagnated in the spleen,\nwill have in that time altered its nature, and acquired a very great\ndegree of acrimony: while it lies dormant, this does no more mischiefs,\nthan those named already; but when violent exercise, a fit of outrageous\nanger, or any thing else that suddenly shocks and disturbs the frame,\nputs it in motion, it melts at once into a kind of liquid putrefaction.\n\nBeing now thin, it mixes itself readily with the blood again, and brings\non putrid fevers; destroys the substance of the spleen itself, or being\nthrown upon some other of the viscera, corrodes them, and leads on this\nway a swift and miserable death. If it fall upon the liver, its tender\npulpy substance is soon destroyed, jaundices beyond the help of art\nfirst follow, then dropsies and all their train of misery; if on lungs,\nconsumptions; if on the brain, convulsions, epilepsy, palsy, apoplexy;\nif on the surface, leprosy.\n\nThe intention of cure is to melt this coagulation softly, not to break\nit violently; and then to give it a very gentle passage through the\nbowels. There is no safe way for it to take but that; and even that when\nurged too far may bring on fatal dysenteries.\n\nLet none wonder at the sudden devastation which sometimes arises from\nthis long stagnant matter, when liquified too hastily: how long, how\nmany years the impacted matter will continue quiet in a schirrous tumour\nof the breast; but being once put in motion, whether from accident, or\nin the course of nature, what can describe; or what can stop its\nhavock!\n\nInstances of the other are too frequent. A nobleman the other day died\nparalytick: dissection shewed a spleen consumed by an abscess, formed\nfrom the dissolved matter of such an obstruction: and 'tis scarce longer\nsince, a learned gentleman, who had been several years lost to his\nfriends, by the extreams of a Hypochondriacal disorder, seem'd gradually\nwithout assistance to recover: but the lungs suffered while the spleen\nwas freed; and he died very soon of what is called a galloping\nconsumption.\n\nWhen the obstruction is great and of long continuance, if it be thus\nhastily moved, the consequence is, equally, a sudden and a miserable\ndeath, whether, like the matter of a cancer, it remains in its place; or\nlike that of a bad small pox, be thrown upon some other vital part.\n\nLet not the patient be too much alarmed; this is laid down to caution,\nnot to terrify him: it is fit he should know his danger, and attend to\nit; for the prevention is easy; and the cure, even of the most advanced\nstages, when undertaken by gentle means, is not at all impracticable: to\nassist the physician, let him look into himself, and recollect the\nsource of his complaint. This he may judge of from the following\nnotices.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. V. - The Causes of the HYPOCHONDRIASIS.\n\n\nThe obstruction which forms this disease, may take its origin from\ndifferent accidents: a fever ill cured has often caused it; or the\npiles, which had been used to discharge largely, ceasing; a marshy soil,\npoisoned with stagnant water, has given it to some persons; and altho'\nindolence and inactivity are oftenest at the root, yet it has arisen\nfrom too great exercise.\n\nReal grief has often brought it on; and even love, for sometimes that is\nreal. Study and fixed attention of the mind have been accused before;\nand add to these the stooping posture of the body, which most men use,\nthough none should use it, in writing and in reading. This has\ncontributed too much to it; but of all other things night studies are\nthe most destructive. The steady stillness, and dusky habit of all\nnature in those hours, enforce, encourage, and support that settled\ngloom, which rises from fixt thought; and sinks the body to the grave;\neven while it carries up the mind to heaven. He who would have his lamp\n        At midnight hour\n  Be seen in some high lonely tower,\nwill waste the flame of this unheeded life: and while he labours to\nunsphere the spirit of Plato will let loose his own.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VI. - The Cure of the HYPOCHONDRIASIS.\n\n\nLet him who would escape the mischiefs of an obstructed spleen, avoid\nthe things here named: and let him who suffers from the malady,\nendeavour to remember to which of them it has been owing; for half the\nhope depends upon that knowledge.\n\nNature has sometimes made a cure herself, and we should watch her ways;\nfor art never is so right as when it imitates her: sometimes the\npatient's own resolution has set him free. This is always in his power,\nand at all times will do wonders.\n\nThe bleeding of the piles, from nature's single efforts, has at once\ncured a miserable man; where their cessation was the cause of the\ndisorder. A leprosy has appeared upon the skin, and all the symptoms of\nthe former sickness vanished. This among the Jews happened often: both\ndiseases we know were common among them: and I have here seen something\nvery like it: Water-Dock has thrown out scorbutic eruptions, and all the\nformer symptoms of an Hypochondriacal disorder have disappeared:\nreturning indeed when these were unadvisedly struck in; but keeping off\nentirely when they were better treated. A natural purging unsuppressed\nhas sometimes done the same good office: but this is hazardous.\n\nIt is easy to be directed from such instances; only let us take the\nwhole along with us. Bleeding would have answered nature's purpose, if\nshe could not have opened of herself the h\u00e6morrhoidal vessels; but he\nwho should give medicines for that purpose, might destroy his patient by\ntoo great disturbance. If a natural looseness may perform the cure, so\nmay an artificial; when the original source of the disorder points that\nway. But these are helps that take place only in particular cases.\n\nThe general and universal method of cure must be by some mild and gently\nresolving medicine, under the influence of which the obstructing matter\nmay be voided that, or some other way with safety. The best season to\nundertake this is the autumn, but even here there must be caution.\n\nIn the first place, no strong evacuating remedy must be given; for that,\nby carrying off the thinner parts of the juices, will tend to thicken\nthe remainder; and certainly encrease the distemper. No acrid medicine\nmust be directed, for that may act too hastily, dissolve the impacted\nmatter at once, and let it loose, to the destruction of the sufferer; no\nantimonial, no mercurial, no martial preparation must be taken; in\nshort, no chymistry: nature is the shop that heaven has set before us,\nand we must seek our medicine there. The venerable ancients, who knew\nnot this new art, will lead us in the search; and (faithful relators as\nthey are of truth) will tell us whence we may deduce our hope; and what\nwe are to fear.\n\nBut prior to the course of any medicine, and as an essential to any good\nhope from it, the patient must prescribe himself a proper course of\nlife, and a well chosen diet: let us assist him in his choice; and speak\nof this first, as it comes first in order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VI. - Rules of Life for Hypochondriac Persons.\n\n\nAir and exercise, as they are the best preservers of health, and\ngreatest assistants in the cure of all long continued diseases, will\nhave their full effect in this; but there requires some caution in the\nchoice, and management of them. It is common to think the air of high\ngrounds best; but experience near home shews otherwise: the\nHypochondriac patient is always worse at Highgate even than in London.\n\nThe air he breathes should be temperate; not exposed to the utmost\nviolences of heat and cold, and the swift changes from one to the\nother; which are most felt on those high grounds. The side of a hill is\nthe best place for him: and though wet grounds are hurtful; yet let\nthere be the shade of trees, to tempt him often to a walk; and soften by\ntheir exhalation the over dryness of the air.\n\nThe exercise he takes should be frequent; but not violent. Motion\npreserves the firmness of the parts, and elasticity of the vessels; it\nprevents that aggregation of thick humours which he is most to fear. A\nsedentary life always produces weakness, and that mischief always\nfollows: weak eyes are gummy, weak lungs are clogged with phlegm, and\nweak bowels waste themselves in vapid diarrhoeas.\n\nLet him invite himself abroad, and let his friends invite him by every\ninnocent inducement. For me, I should advise above all other things the\nstudy of nature. Let him begin with plants: he will here find a\ncontinual pleasure, and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful\nthings; even of the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to\nwalk; and every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket,\nwill afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually\nin the air, and continually to change the nature and quality of the air,\nby visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the lawn, the\nheath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be abroad; and the\nunceasing variety of the subjects of his observation, will prevent his\nwalking hastily: he will pursue his studies in the air; and that\ncontemplative turn of mind, which in his closet threatened his\ndestruction, will thus become the great means of his recovery.\n\nIf the mind tire upon this, from the repeated use, another of nature's\nkingdoms opens itself at once upon him; the plant he is weary of\nobserving, feeds some insect he may examine; nor is there a stone that\nlies before his foot, but may afford instruction and amusement.\n\nEven what the vulgar call the most abject things will shew a wonderful\nutility; and lead the mind, in pious contemplation higher than the\nstars. The poorest moss that is trampled under foot, has its important\nuses: is it at the bottom of a wood we find it? why there it shelters\nthe fallen seeds; hides them from birds, and covers them from frost;\nand thus becomes the foster father of another forest! creeps it along\nthe surface of a rock? even there its good is infinite! its small roots\nrun into the stone, and the rains make their way after them; the moss\nhaving lived its time dies; it rots and with the mouldered fragments of\nthe stone forms earth; wherein, after a few successions, useful plants\nmay grow, and feed more useful cattle!\n\nIs there a weed more humble in its aspect, more trampled on, or more\ndespised than knot grass! no art can get the better of its growth, no\nlabour can destroy it; 'twere pity if they could, for the thing lives\nwhere nothing would of use to us; and its large and most wonderfully\nabundant seeds, feed in hard winters, half the birds of Heaven.\n\nWhat the weak moss performs upon the rock the loathed toadstool brings\nabout in timber: is an oak dead where man's eye will not find it? this\nfungus roots itself upon the bark, and rots the wood beneath it; hither\nthe beetle creeps for shelter, and for sustenance; him the woodpecker\nfollows as his prey; and while he tears the tree in search of him, he\nscatters it about the ground; which it manures.\n\nNor is it the beetle alone that thus insinuates itself into the\nsubstance of the vegetable tribe: the tender aphide, whom a touch\ndestroys, burrows between the two skins of a leaf, for shelter from his\nwinged enemies; tracing, with more than Dedal\u00e6an art, his various\nmeanders; and veining the green surface with these white lines more\nbeautifully than the best \u00c6gyptian marble.\n\n'Twere endless to proceed; nor is it needful: one object will not fail\nto lead on to another, and every where the goodness of his God will\nshine before him even in what are thought the vilest things; his\ngreatness in the lead of them.\n\nLet him pursue these thoughts, and seek abroad the objects and the\ninstigations to them: but let him in these and all other excursions\navoid equally the dews of early morning, and of evening.\n\nThe more than usual exercise of this prescription will dispose him to\nmore than customary sleep, let him indulge it freely; so far from\nhurting, it will help his cure.\n\nLet him avoid all excesses: drink need scarce be named, for we are\nwriting to men of better and of nobler minds, than can be tempted to\nthat humiliating vice. Those who in this disorder have too great an\nappetite, must not indulge it; much eaten was never well digested: but\nof all excesses the most fatal in this case is that of venery. It is the\nexcess we speak of.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VII. - The proper DIET.\n\n\nIn the first place acids must be avoided carefully; and all things that\nare in a state of fermentation, for they will breed acidity. Provisions\nhardened by salting never should be tasted; much less those cured by\nsmoaking, and by salting. Bacon is indigestible in an Hypochondriac\nstomach; and hams, impregnated as is now the custom, with acid fumes\nfrom the wood fires over which they are hung, have that additional\nmischief.\n\nMilk ought to be a great article in the diet: and even in this there\nshould be choice. The milk of grass-fed cows has its true quality: no\nother. There are a multitude of ways in which this may be made a part\nboth of our foods and drinks, and they should all be used.\n\nThe great and general caution is that the diet be at all times of a kind\nloosening and gently stimulating; light but not acrid. Veal, lamb,\nfowls, lobsters, crabs, craw-fish, fresh water fish and mutton broth,\nwith plenty of boiled vegetables, are always right; and give enough\nvariety.\n\nRaw vegetables are all bad: sour wines, old cheese, and bottled beer are\nthings never to be once tasted. Indeed much wine is wrong, be it of what\nkind soever. It is the first of cordials; and as such I would have it\ntaken in this disease when it is wanted: plainly as a medicine, rather\nthan a part of diet. Malt liquor carefully chosen is certainly the best\ndrink. This must be neither new, nor tending to sourness; perfectly\nclear, and of a moderate strength: it is the native liquor of our\ncountry, and the most healthful.\n\nToo much tea weakens; and even sugar is in this disorder hurtful: but\nhoney may supply its place in most things; and this is not only harmless\nbut medicinal; a very powerful dissolvent of impacted humours, and a\ngreat deobstruent.\n\nWhat wine is drank should be of some of the sweet kinds. Old Hock has\nbeen found on enquiry to yield more than ten times the acid of the sweet\nwines; and in red Port, at least in what we are content to call so,\nthere is an astringent quality, that is most mischievous in these cases:\nit is said there is often alum in it: how pregnant with mischief that\nmust be to persons whose bowels require to be kept open, is most\nevident. Summer fruits perfectly ripe are not only harmless but\nmedicinal; but if eaten unripe they will be very prejudicial. A light\nsupper, which will leave an appetite for a milk breakfast, is always\nright; this will not let the stomach be ravenous for dinner, as it is\napt to be in those who make that their only meal.\n\nOne caution more must be given, and it may seem a strange one: it is\nthat the patient attend regularly to his hours of eating. We have to do\nwith men for the most part whose soul is the great object of their\nregard; but let them not forget they have a body.\n\nThe late Dr. STUKELY has told me, that one day by appointment visiting\nSir ISAAC NEWTON, the servant told him, he was in his study. No one was\npermitted to disturb him there; but as it was near dinner time, the\nvisitor sat down to wait for him. After a time dinner was brought in; a\nboil'd chicken under a cover. An hour pass'd, and Sir ISAAC did not\nappear. The doctor eat the fowl, and covering up the empty dish, bad\nthem dress their master another. Before that was ready, the great man\ncame down; he apologiz'd for his delay, and added, \"give me but leave to\ntake my short dinner, and I shall be at your service; I am fatigued and\nfaint.\" Saying this, he lifted up the cover; and without any emotion,\nturned about to STUKELY with a smile; \"See says he, what we studious\npeople are, I forgot I had din'd.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VIII. - The MEDICINE.\n\n\n'Tis the ill fate of this disease, more than of all others to be\nmisunderstood at first, and thence neglected; till the physician shakes\nhis head at a few first questions. None steals so fatally upon the\nsufferer: its advances are by very slow degrees; but every day it grows\nmore difficult of cure.\n\nThat this obstruction in the spleen is the true malady, the cases\nrelated by the antients, present observation, and the unerring\ntestimonies of dissections leave no room to doubt. Being understood, the\npath is open where to seek a remedy: and our best guides in this, as in\nthe former instance, will be those venerable Greeks; who saw a thousand\nof these cases, where we see one; and with less than half our theory,\ncured twice as many patients.\n\nOne established doctrine holds place in all these writers; that whatever\nby a hasty fermentation dissolves the impacted matter of the\nobstruction, and sends it in that state into the blood, does incredible\nmischief: but that whatever medicine softens it by slow degrees, and, as\nit melts, delivers it to the bowels without disturbance; will cure with\nequal certainty and safety.\n\nFor this good purpose, they knew and tried a multitude of herbs; but in\nthe end they fixed on one: and on their repeated trials of this, they\nbanished all the rest. This stood alone for the cure of the disease; and\nfrom its virtue received the name of SPLEEN-WORT. O wise and happy\nGreeks! authors of knowledge and perpetuators of it! With them the very\nname they gave a plant declared its virtues: with us, a writer calls a\nplant from some friend; that the good gardener who receives the honour,\nmay call another by his name who gave it. We now add the term smooth\nto this herb, to distinguish it from another, called by the same general\nterm, though not much resembling it.\n\nThe virtues of this smooth Spleen-wort have flood the test of ages; and\nthe plant every where retained its name and credit: and one of our good\nherbalists, who had seen a wonderful case of a swoln spleen, so big, and\nhard as to be felt with terror, brought back to a state of nature by it;\nand all the miserable symptoms vanish; thought Spleen-wort not enough\nexpressive of its excellence; but stamp'd on it the name of MILT-WASTE.\n\nIn the Greek Islands now, the use of it is known to every one; and even\nthe lazy monks who take it, are no longer splenetic. In the west of\nEngland, the rocks are stripped of it with diligence; and every old woman\ntells you how charming that leaf is for bookish men: in Russia they use\na plant of this kind in their malt liquor: it came into fashion there\nfor the cure of this disease; which from its constant use is scarce\nknown any longer; and they suppose 'tis added to their liquor for a\nflavour.\n\nThe ancients held it in a kind of veneration; and used what has been\ncalled a superstition in the gathering it. It was to be taken up with a\nsharp knife, without violence, and laid upon the clean linen: no time\nbut the still darkness of the night was proper, and even the moon was\nnot to shine upon it. I know they have been ridiculed for this; for\nnothing is so vain as learned ignorance: but let me be permitted once to\nvindicate them.\n\nThe plant has leaves that can close in their sides; and their under part\nis covered thick with a yellow powder, consisting of the seeds, and seed\nvessels: in these they knew the virtue most resided: this was the golden\ndust they held so valuable; and this they knew they could not be too\ncautious to preserve. They were not ignorant of the sleep of plants; a\nmatter lately spoken of by some, as if a new discovery; and being\nsensible that light, a dry air, an expanded leaf, and a tempestuous\nseason, were the means of losing this fine dust; and knowing also that\ndarkness alone brought on that closing of the leaf which thence has\nbeen called sleep; and which helped to defend and to secure it, they\ntherefore took such time, and used such means as could best preserve the\nplant entire; and even save what might be scattered from it.--And now\nwhere is their superstition?\n\nFrom this plant thus collected they prepared a medicine, which in a\ncourse of forty days scarce ever failed to make a perfect cure.\n\nWe have the plant wild with us; and till the fashion of rough chemical\npreparations took off our attention from these gentler remedies, it was\nin frequent use and great repute. I trust it will be so again: and many\nthank me for restoring it to notice.\n\nSpleen-wort gives out its virtues freely in a tincture; and a small dose\nof this, mixing readily with the blood and juices, gradually dissolves\nthe obstruction; and by a little at a time delivers its contents to be\nthrown off without pain, from the bowels. Let this be done while the\nviscera are yet sound and the cure is perfect. More than the forty days\nof the Greek method is scarce ever required; much oftener two thirds of\nthat time suffice; and every day, from the first dose of it, the patient\nfeels the happy change that is growing in his constitution. His food no\nmore turns putrid on his stomach, but yields its healthful nourishment.\n\nThe swelling after meals therefore vanishes; and with that goes the\nlowness, and anxiety, the difficult breath, and the distracting cholick:\nhe can bear the approach of rainy weather without pain; he finds himself\nmore apt for motion, and ready to take that exercise which is to be\nassistant in his cure; life seems no longer burthensome. His bowels get\ninto the natural condition of health, and perform their office once at\nleast a day; better if a little more: the dull and dead colour of his\nskin goes off, his lips grow red again, and every sign of health\nreturns.\n\nLet him who takes the medicine, say whether any thing here be\nexaggerated. Let him, if he pleases to give himself the trouble, talk\nover with me, or write to me, this gradual decrease of his complaints,\nas he proceeds in his cure. My uncertain state of health does not\npermit me to practise physic in the usual way, but I am very desirous to\ndo what good I can, and shall never refuse my advice, such as it may be,\nto any person rich or poor, in whatever manner he may apply for it. I\nshall refer him to no apothecary, whose bills require he should be\ndrenched with potions; but tell him, in this as in all other cases,\nwhere to find some simple herb; which he may if he please prepare\nhimself; or if he had rather spare that trouble, may have it so prepared\nfrom me.\n\nWith regard to Spleen-wort, no method of using it is more effectual than\nsimply taking it in powder; the only advantage of a tincture, is that a\nproper dose may be given, and yet the stomach not be loaded with so\nlarge a quantity: it is an easier and pleasanter method, and nothing\nmore.\n\nIf any person choose to take it in the other way, I should still wish\nhim once at least to apply to me; that he may be assured what he is\nabout to take is the right plant. Abuses in medicines are at this time\nvery great, and in no instance worse than what relates to herbs. The\nbest of our physicians have complained upon this head with warmth, but\nwithout redress: they know the virtues and the value of many of our\nnative plants, but dread to prescribe them; lest some wrong thing should\nbe administered in their place; perhaps inefficacious, perhaps\nmischievous, nay it may be fatal. The few simple things I direct are\nalways before me; and it will at all times be a pleasure to me, in this\nand any other instance, to see whether what any person is about to take\nbe right. I have great obligations to the public, and this is the best\nreturn that I know how to make.\n\nTo see the need of such a caution, hear a transaction but of yesterday!\n\nAn intelligent person was directed to go to the medicinal herb shops in\nthe several markets, and buy some of this Spleen-wort; the name was\nwritten, and shewn to every one; every shop received his money, and\nalmost every one sold a different plant, under the name of this: but\nwhat is very striking, not one of them the right. Such is the chance of\nhealth in those hands through which the best means of it usually pass;\neven in the most regular course of application.\n\nI would not be understood to limit the little services I may this way be\nable to render the afflicted, to this single instance; much less to\npropose to myself any advantages from it. Whoever pleases will be\nwelcome to me, upon any such occasion; and whatever be the herb on which\nhe places a dependance, he shall be shewn it growing. I once recommended\na garden to be established for this use, at the public expence: one\ngreat person has put it in my power to answer all its purposes.\n\n                        F  I  N  I  S.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris, he was\n\"nominated\" to the Academy. He had but to present an Historical\nPainting in order to take his seat as an Academician.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VENUS AND MARRIAGE\n\n\nBack in his beloved Paris again; thrilled by the atmosphere and gaiety\nof its merry life; in the full vigour of manhood on the eve of his\nthirties; amongst congenial friends; done with the drudgery of winning\nto Academic honour, Boucher saw that the public were not falling over\neach other to purchase religious or historic pictures; he straightway\nturned his back upon these things, and on the edge of his thirtieth\nyear he gave to the world his \"Marriage of the Children of God with\nthe Children of Men,\" in which Venus is the avowed mistress of his\nadoration. It caused a fine stir, and greatly increased his repute.\n\nIn this picture he ends his Italian period and strikes his own\npersonal note. Both this and the \"Venus asking arms for Aeneas from\nVulcan,\" together with the \"Birth of Adonis\" and the \"Death of\nAdonis,\" of about the same period, still show Boucher strongly under\nthe influence of his master, Lemoyne. Indeed, the \"Birth\" and \"Death\nof Adonis,\" their record lost during the scuffle and confusion of the\nRevolution, for long hung side by side as pictures by Lemoyne, until,\nbeing cleaned about 1860, Boucher's initials were discovered upon\nthem, and, contemporary engravings being hunted up, still further\nproved their origin. But in the Venus that now figures in all his\nworks there is that flesh-painting of the nude, and that rosy touch\nupon the flesh of the female figure, that are a far more certain\nsignature of Boucher's handiwork than any written name.\n\nUnfortunately the Salons were closed during Boucher's earlier years\nuntil he was thirty-four, and the record of his work during these\nyears is difficult to follow; but with his service to Venus his\npersonal career begins, and the stream of his Venus-pieces steadily\nflows from his hands.\n\nHe came to her service rid of all prentice essays in craftsmanship, a\nfinished and consummate artist. He found in his subject a goddess to\nwhom he could devote his great and splendid gifts. He painted her\ndainty body with a radiant delight and a rare colour-sense such as\nFrance had never before seen or uttered. He remains to this day the\nfirst painter of the subtle, delicate, and elusive thing that is\nfemininity; he caught her allure, her charm, as he was to catch the\nfragrance and charm of children and flowers; and he set the statement\nof these things upon canvas as they have never been uttered.\n\nThe whole of his life long, Boucher gave himself up with equal and\npassionate devotion to work and to pleasure--working at his easel\noften twelve hours of his day without losing, to the end when the\nbrush fell from his dead fingers, his blitheness of heart or his\ngenerosity of act, and without weakening the pleasure-loving desires\nof his gadding spirit. Out of his splendid toil he made the means to\nindulge his tastes for pleasure; and the gratifying of his tastes in\nturn renewed and created the ideas that made the subjects of his\nartistry. He brought to all he did a joy in the doing that made of his\nvast labour one long pleasure--of his pleasures a riot of industry. He\nplayed as he toiled, scarce knowing which was play and which toil.\n\nThe gossip of his love-affairs makes no romantic story--they were but\ncommonplace ecstasies with unknown frail women. But hard as he worked\nand lived and played, he found time to get himself married in his\nthirtieth year to pretty seventeen-year-old Marie Jeanne Buseau, a\nlittle Parisian--and for love of her, so far as he understood the\nbusiness; for she brought him no dowry.\n\nThe young couple settled down for the next ten years in the Rue\nSaint-Thomas-du-Louvre. Here Boucher lived through his thirties.\n\nMadame was a pretty creature, if we had but Latour's pastel portrait\nalone to prove it. But the pretty features were the crown to as pretty\na body, for she sat often to her lord; and it is clear from his\ncorrespondence with a friend, Bachaumont, that she is the Psyche of\nhis illustrated fable--and Psyche runs much to the Altogether.\n\nMarriage, however, was not likely to imprison Boucher's gadding eyes;\nand it did not. Madame Boucher seems to have had as frail a heart, and\navoided strife by amusing herself, amongst others, with the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who, to gain access to the lady,\ncommissioned Boucher to do the Watteau-like illustrations to\nAcajou--a dull affair. Boucher's pretty wife, herself no mean\nartist, worked in his studio, and painted several smaller canvases\nafter his pictures, gaining some fame as a miniaturist and engraver.\n\nNor did Marriage turn Boucher from his art. Two years were gone by\nsince his nomination to the Academy; he had now to paint the formal\nHistorical Picture and present it in order to take his seat as\nAcademician; and it was in this his thirtieth year that he painted and\nwon his academic rank with the \"Renauld et Armide\" now at the Louvre.\n\nHere he sufficiently subordinated his own style to the academic to\nensure success; and the work was hailed by Academicians and critics,\nincluding Diderot, with enthusiasm. But even here we have his cupids\npeeping round the mythologic event; and Armide herself has pretty\nFrench lips that knew no Greek.\n\nOnce secure of his position, he straightway flung the last remnants of\nthe academic style out of his studio door; and it is a grim comment on\ncriticism that it was just exactly in proportion as he developed his\nown personal genius and uttered the France of his day, that he was\nattacked; whilst the stilted things that he knew were third-rate, and\nwhich he wholly rejected from henceforth, were exactly the things that\nwere praised!\n\nHis election to the Academy, and the enthusiasm over the picture that\nwon him his seat thereat, brought his name before the young king; the\nfollowing year he received his first order from the Court whose\npainter he was destined to become. The decorations in the queen's\napartments were gloomy and had grown black; and he painted in their\nstead the \"Charity,\" \"Abundance,\" \"Fidelity,\" and \"Prudence\" still\nthere to be seen. Indeed, with his gay vision, his pretty habit of\nculling only the flowers from the garden of life, and his quickness to\nset down the pleasing thing in every prospect, Boucher was the\ndestined painter of a Court weary of pomposity and the pose of the\nmock-heroic, and which was wholly giving itself up to pleasure and the\nelegances.\n\nBut neither his new dignity of Academician nor the royal favour, kept\nhim from the bookshops; and he illustrated, with rare beauty and a\ncharm worthy of Watteau, the great edition of the Works of Moli\u00e8re\nin his thirty-first year. It is true that he made as free with\nMoli\u00e8re's world as with the Gods of Olympus; he peoples the plays with\ncharacters of his own day, arrayed in the dress and habit of that day,\nand moving in surroundings that he saw about him.\n\n\nLE MONDE QUI S'AMUSE\n\n\nThe Homely had come upon the town out of Holland, painted with most\nconsummate artistry by Chardin, and was soon in the vogue. Boucher had\na quick eye for the mode. And he straightway set himself to the\npainting of \"La Belle Cuisini\u00e8re.\" Still-life and homely subjects need\nan accuracy of realism and a Dutch sense of these things, a sense of\nsincerity and an appreciation of the dignity of the work-a-day life of\nthe people, in which Boucher was wholly lacking. Above all, it calls\nfor a sense of \"character,\" which, in Boucher, was always weak. It was\na sneer against him that his very broomsticks called for pompons and\nribbons--and there was more than a little truth in the spite. He is\nmore concerned with the accident of the kissing of a kitchen-maid than\nwith the kitchen's habit. He cannot even peep into a scullery without\ndragging in Venus by the skirts, and tricking her out in a\nproperty-wardrobe of a scullery-wench, in which the girl is clearly\nbut acting the part.\n\nHowever, these passing vogues and experiments in different methods\nwere only gay asides--he was working the while upon his own subjects;\nand, to the display by its several members ordered by the Academy, he\nsent four little paintings of fauns and cupids which won him the\nhonour of election as deputy-professor. His brain and hand were very\nbusy, and he turns from one thing to another with amazing facility,\nbringing distinction to all that he does.\n\nBut he painted about this time two pictures of infants, \"L'Amour\nOiseleur\" and \"L'Amour Moissonneur,\" which were the beginning of that\nhost of cupids that he let fly from his studio; they frolic across his\ncanvases and join the retinue of Venus, peeping out from clouds, over\nwaves, round curtains, painted with a perfection that has never been\nsurpassed in the portrayal of infants. He painted their round limbs,\ntheir lusty life, their delightful awkwardnesses, their jolly fat\ngrace, their na\u00efve surprise at life and glory in it, as they had never\nbeen painted before, and have never been painted since.\n\nHe also gave forth in this his thirty-third year a \"Pastoral\" and a\n\"Shepherd and Shepherdess in Conversation,\" with sheep about them and\nin a pleasant landscape, which were his first essays in the style that\nhe created and which made him famous.\n\nHis friend Meissonnier, the inventor of the rococo, stood godfather to\nBoucher's first-born son in the May of 1736.\n\nFrom the very beginning Boucher seems to have been engraved. And these\nengravings, done by the best gravers of his day, greatly extended his\nreputation and popularised him; he fully realised the value of the\nadvertisement as well as his profits from it. Before his thirty-third\nyear was run out he published his well-known \"Cries of Paris.\"\n\nBoucher's description of them, \"studies from the low classes,\" holds\nthe key to that something of failure to realise the dramatic verities\nthat is over all; it gives also the attitude of the France that he\nknew towards the France that he did not, and could not understand. He\ncreated that dainty, pleasant atmosphere that comes floating up to the\nwindows on a fresh morning in Paris from the musical cries of\nthe street vendors; but of the deeper significance of the\nstreet-sellers--of the miserable accent in their life, of their weary\ntoil, of the dignity of their labour--he knew nothing; his brush could\nnot refrain from making elegance and fine manners peep from behind the\nstreet-porter's fustian or the milkmaid's skirt.\n\nBut his thirty-third year was to contain a more far-reaching\nsignificance even than the creation of his cupid-pieces and pastorals.\n\nThe \"Cries of Paris\" were scarce printed when Boucher's illustration\nto \"Don Quixote\" appeared--\"Sancho pursued by the servants of the\nDuke.\" This design was to have far-reaching results that Boucher\nlittle suspected.\n\nThe painter Oudry had been called to the conduct of the great tapestry\nlooms at Beauvais a couple of years before; and in his efforts to\nfurnish the looms with good designs, he now called Boucher to his aid,\nwhose original and fresh style, colour, and arrangement, together with\nhis personal vision, and the enthusiasm and zeal with which he threw\nhimself into the work, at once increased the reputation and the\nproducts of the famous looms. This large designing for the tapestries\nwas, in return, of immense value to the development of the genius of\nthe man, enlarging his breadth of style and giving scope to that great\ndecorative sense that was his superb gift. Thenceforth he was destined\nto play a supreme part in the history of the world-famed factories. He\nnow produced painting after painting for the Beauvais looms.\n\nLife is now one long triumph for Boucher, only disturbed in this year\nby the sad news of the suicide of his old master, Lemoyne. It was in\nthis, Boucher's thirty-fourth year, that the Salon was opened for the\nfirst time since Boucher's infancy, and he contributed several\ncanvases to it.\n\nRigaud, the old Academician, now close upon eighty, straggling through\nthe great galleries, might well blink and gasp at the change that had\ncome over French art since he last exhibited there, thirty-three years\ngone by; but his scoffs and regrets held no terrors for the younger\nAcademicians gathered about. He stood in a new world. A new generation\nwas in possession. The grand manner, the severe etiquette, formal\nmock-heroics, and solemn pomposity of Louis the Fourteenth were\nvanished, and the Agreeable and the Pleasant Make-Believe of Louis the\nFifteenth reigned in their stead. Old Rigaud might blink indeed! Just\nas the imposing and stilted etiquette of the reception-room had given\nplace to the easy manners and airy etiquette of the dainty boudoir, so\nhad light chatter and gay wit and the quick repartee usurped the heavy\nsplendours of a consequential age. France, weary of an eternal pose of\nthe grand manner, was seeking change in joyousness and amusement.\n\nGallantry and gaiety were become the object of the ambition of a\ndandified and elegant day. France became a coquette; dressed herself\nas a porcelain shepherdess; and with beribboned crook and sheep,\nseeking pleasant prospects to stroll through, gave herself to\ndalliance--her powder-puff and patch-box and fan a serious part of her\nunseriousness.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE CH\u00c2TEAUROUX\n\n\nAt thirty-five Boucher has arrived. He is in the vogue; in favour at\nCourt--as well as in the fashion. In his three years from taking his\nseat at the Academy to the opening of the first Salon he has created a\nnew and original style--his cupid pieces, his pastorals, his\nVenus-pieces, his tapestry. Boucher's kingdom lay in the realm of the\ndecorative painter--and he has found it. Torn from the surroundings\nfor which he designed them, as part and parcel of the general scheme,\nhis pictures are as out of place as an Italian altarpiece in an\nEnglish dining-room, yet they suffer less. Several may still be seen,\nas he set them up in frames of his own planning, as overdoors in the\npalace of the Soubise, now given up to the national archives.\n\nThe ghost of the Prince of Soubise, who commissioned them, may haunt\nhis palace, but his kin know the place no longer. The overdoors\nwrought by Boucher's skill look down now on the nation's collection of\nhistoric documents. The \"Three Graces enchaining Love,\" the fine\npastoral of \"The Cage,\" and the pastoral of the \"Shepherd placing a\nRose in his Shepherdess's Hair,\" were to see a mightier change than\nthe usurpation of Louis the Fourteenth's pompous age by the elegant\nyears of Louis the Fifteenth. But this was not as yet. Here at least\nwe see Boucher's art rid of all outside influences, and at the full\ntide of creation; here we have the inimitable lightness of touch, the\nfigures and landscape bathed in the airy volume of atmosphere.\n\nHe seems at this time to have played with pastel, due probably to his\nfriendship with Latour, who sent a portrait of Boucher's wife to this\nSalon. Boucher showed in the use of chalks the artistry and skill that\nwere always at his command.\n\nHe also was putting to its full use his innate sense of landscape,\nraising to high achievement that astonishing balance of landscape and\nfigures in his design--a balance that has never been surpassed; his\nfigures never override his landscape; his landscape never overpowers\nhis figures. His earnest counsels to his pupils and his constant\ndeploring of the lack of the landscape art in France prove the great\nstress he laid upon it.\n\nThe designing of a frontispiece for the catalogue of a personal\nfriend, one Gersaint, a merchant of oriental wares, started Boucher in\nhis thirty-third year upon that series of Chinese pictures and\ntapestries known as the \"Chinoiseries,\" in which he frittered away\nonly too many precious hours, for they were received with great favour\nby the public. The paintings of Chinese subjects designed for the\nlooms of Beauvais are still to be seen at Besan\u00e7on.\n\nBut busy as were his brain and hand in the exercise of his wide and\nversatile gifts, pouring out \"Chinoiseries,\" illustrations for books,\ntapestries on a large scale, landscapes, models for the gilt bronze\ndecorations of porcelain vases, scheming handsome frames for his\npictures, designing furniture and fans--Boucher was true, above all,\n\"to his goddess,\" and painted the famed \"Birth of Venus,\" which,\nthanks to the Swedish Ambassador's fondness for Madame Boucher, now\nhangs at Stockholm; our amorous Count de Tessin, to be just, seems to\nhave had a rare flair for the artistic--besides artist's wives. It was\non the 15th of April in 1742, the last year of his thirties, that the\nRoyal favour was marked by the grant of a pension of 400 livres\n(double florins) to Boucher with promise of early benefits to follow.\n\nTwo years afterwards it was raised to 600 livres.\n\nThis was the year that he painted the beautiful canvas of \"Diana\nleaving the Bath with one of her Companions,\" now at the Louvre. It\nwas also the year that saw his landscape, the \"Hamlet of Iss\u00e9\" at the\nSalon. This \"Hameau d'Iss\u00e9\" was to be enlarged for the Opera, proving\nhim to be decorator there, where he was arranging waterfalls,\ncascades, and the rest of the pretty business, without staying his\nhand from his art.\n\nAt forty Boucher has come into his kingdom. The ten years of these\nforties were to be a vast triumph for him. He was to produce\nmasterpiece after masterpiece. His art had caught the taste of the\nday. He was at the height of his powers. He had done great things--he\nwas to do greater. During these ten years of his forties he poured\nforth vivid and glowing works of sustained power and originality.\n\nWe have a picture of him as he was in the flesh at this time--the\npastel portrait by Lundberg, now at the Louvre--a gay, somewhat\ndissipated, handsomely dressed dandy of the time, smiling out of his\ncareless day, the debonnair man of fashion, the laughing eyes showing\nsigns of the night carousals, which were the rest from the prodigious\ntoil of this vital and forthright spirit.\n\nIt was in this our artist's fortieth year that the gifted old Cardinal\nFleury, who had guided the fortunes of France with rare skill, died,\nbroken by his ninety years and the blunders of the disastrous war that\nhe had so strenuously opposed; and Louis, essaying the strut of\nkingship, became king by act. His indolent character, unequal to the\nmighty business, his indeterminate will fretted by the set of\nquarrelling and intriguing rogues that he gathered about him as his\nministers, he fell into the habit that became his thenceforth, the\nonly thing to which he paid the tribute of constancy--he ruled France\nfrom behind pretty petticoats. He had early shown the adulterous blood\nof his great-grandfather; two, if not three, of five sisters of the\nnoble and historic house of De Nesle had yielded to his gadding fancy;\nthe youngest now ousted her sister De Mailly from the king's favour,\nwas publicly acknowledged as the king's mistress, and became Duchess\nof Ch\u00e2teauroux. Boucher painted her handsome being as a shepherdess in\none of his pastorals. She was no ordinary toy of a king. A woman of\ntalent, with hot ambitions for the king's majesty, fired with the\npride of race of the old French noblesse, it was during her short\nyears of ascendancy over the king that he roused from his body's\ntorpor and made an effort to reach the dignity and eminence befitting\nto the lord of a great and gallant people. He stepped forth awhile\nfrom his drunken bouts and manifold mean adulteries, and set himself\nat the head of the army in Flanders, and strutted it as conqueror.\n\nPoor Ch\u00e2teauroux only got the hate of the people for reward, Louis the\nhonours; for the people resented the public dishonour of her state.\n\nPower she found to be a dead-sea apple in her pretty mouth. The glory\nof it all, the splendours, were not the easily won delights for which\nshe had looked. She had to fight a duel, that never ended, with the\nking's witty, crafty, and scurrilous Prime Minister, the notorious\nMaurepas--and Maurepas willed that no woman should ever come between\nhim and the king--Maurepas who knew no mercy, no decency, no chivalry,\nno scruple. At Ch\u00e2teauroux's urging, Louis placed himself at the\nhead of the army; and France went near mad with joy that she had\nagain found a king. Crafty Maurepas urged on the business; the\nCh\u00e2teauroux suddenly realised his cunning glee--it separated her from\nthe king.\n\nOut of the whirl of things Boucher's fortune was ripening, little as\nhe might suspect it.\n\nHe was painting masterpieces that make his name live. To his fortieth\nyear belong the famed \"Birth of Venus,\" the \"Venus leaving the Bath,\"\nthe \"Muse Clio,\" the \"Muse Melpomene,\" and the three well-known\npastorals now at the Louvre--\"The Sleeping Shepherdess,\" the \"Nest,\"\n\n\nand the \"Shepherd and Shepherdesses.\" Of the many famous Venus-pieces\nthat his hand painted during these years it is not easy to write the\nlist. But having signed the \"Marriage of Love and Psyche\" at\nforty-one, he turned his experimental hand to the homely, realistic\nDutch style that was having a wide vogue, and painted the\n\"Dejeuner\"--a family of the prosperous class of the day at\nbreakfast--showing with rare charm the surroundings and home life of\nthe well-to-do of his time.\n\nAll goes well with Boucher. He changes into better quarters in the Rue\nde Grenelle-Saint-Honor\u00e9, where he lived for the next five years,\nuntil 1749; but his eyes are fixed upon a studio and apartments at\nthe old palace of the Louvre, though the hard intriguing of his\npowerful friends at Court on his behalf failed for some time. He had,\nindeed, to make another move before he arrived at his longed-for goal.\n\nPensions Boucher, like others, had found to be somewhat empty affairs;\nbut rooms at the Louvre were a solid possession eagerly sought after\nby the artists.\n\nIn this year of 1744 Boucher created a new fashion at the annual Salon\nby sending studies and sketches instead of finished pictures; and it\nset a value upon such things not before realised by artists, for\nsuccess was instant and loud.\n\nTowards the end of the next, Boucher's forty-second year, the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who was to take his leave of Paris,\ncommissioned four pictures to represent the day of a woman of fashion,\nand to be entitled \"Morning,\" \"Midday,\" \"Evening,\" and \"Night.\"\n\nBoucher painted one of these for him, now known as the \"Marchande de\nModes.\" The others were painted later, and all had a wide vogue as\nengravings. The correspondence has interest since it reveals Boucher's\nbusiness habits; he was paid for a picture on its delivery, and for\neach of these he was to receive 600 livres (double florins or\ndollars)--about a hundred and twenty pounds.\n\nIn an official document of the Director of Buildings to the king (or\nMinister of Fine Art, as we should say), written in this year of 1745,\nBoucher being forty-two, is a \"list of the best painters,\" in which\nBoucher is singled out for distinction as \"an historic painter, living\nin the Rue de Grenelle-Saint-Honor\u00e9, opposite the Rue des Deux-Ecus,\npupil of Lemoyne, excelling also in landscape, grotesques, and\nornaments in the manner of Watteau; and equally skilled in painting\nflowers, fruit, architecture, and subjects of gallantry and of\nfashion.\"\n\nNot so bad for dry officialdom; the critics could learn a lesson. For\nhe was nothing less. What indeed does he not do? and wondrous well!\nthis painter of the age.\n\nAnd the mighty rush of events is about to sweep him into further\nprominence; the very things which he probably passed by with a gay\nshrug are to enrich him, to help him to his highest fulfilment.\n\nPoor Ch\u00e2teauroux saw that she must lose the king's gadding favour in\nthe conflict with Maurepas unless she joined her lord, now with the\narmy. She realised full well that she had created the new Louis of\nAmbition--that her going must bring the people's hate to her. But she\ndared not lose the king. And she went. Maurepas had overdone his\njibings. The indiscretion at once rang through the land; became the\njest of the army--and Maurepas was not far from the bottom of the\nbusiness. The discreet indiscretion of covered ways between the king's\nlodgings and hers only added to the mockeries, and increased the\npeople's hate against, of course, the Ch\u00e2teauroux. Then upon a day in\nAugust the small-pox seized Louis at Metz; poor Ch\u00e2teauroux fought for\npossession of the king in the sick room, until his fear of\ndeath--Louis' sole piety--sent her packing--shrinking back in the\nhired carriage at each halting-place for change of horses, lest she\nshould be seen and torn from her place and destroyed by the populace.\n\nBut Louis recovered; Paris rang with bells at joy on his recovery, and\nhe entered the city amidst mad enthusiasm, hailed as The Well-Beloved.\n\nHe sent for the Ch\u00e2teauroux to find her dying, Maurepas having to\ndeliver the message of recall. She died suddenly and in great agony,\nswearing that Maurepas had poisoned her--died in the arms of her poor\ndiscarded sister, the De Mailly.\n\nBut this year of 1745 Boucher hears a mightier scandal that is to mean\nvast things to all France--and not least of all to Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE POMPADOUR\n\n\nA young bride had become the gossip of the rich merchant society of\nParis--that class that was ousting the old noblesse from power. She\nwas a beautiful, a remarkable woman; her wit was repeated in the\ndrawing-rooms, she had all the accomplishments; her charming\nname--Madame Lenormant d'Etioles.\n\nDraw aside the curtains of the past and we discover our little Jeanne\nPoisson--grown into this exquisite creature. It has come about in\nstrange fashion enough. The father--a scandalous fellow--having\nfingered the commissariat moneys in ugly ways to his own use, had been\nbanished for the ugly business. Nor is Jeanne's mother any better than\nshe should be; and the wags wink knowingly at the handsome and rich\nman of fashion, Monsieur Lenormant de Tournehem, who has been the\nfavoured gallant during the absence of the light-fingered Poisson.\n\nAnd, of a truth, Lenormant de Tournehem takes astonishing interest in\nthe little Jeanne--watching over her up-growing and giving her the\nbest of education at the convent, where she wins all hearts, and is\nknown as \"the little queen.\" The truth spoken with wondrous prophecy,\nif unthinkingly, as we shall see. Complacent Poisson came home, and\ntook the rich and fashionable, bland and smiling Lenormant de\nTournehem to his arms. Has he not wealth and estates? therefore as\nexcellent a friend for Poisson as for Madame Poisson. The girl Jeanne\nleaves the convent to be taught the accomplishments by the supreme\nmasters of France, the wits foregather at Madame Poisson's, and the\nbrilliant Jeanne is soon mistress of the arts--coquetry not least of\nall; has also the most exquisite taste in dress. Under all is a heart\ncold as steel; calculating as the higher mathematics. She has but one\nhindrance to ambition--her mean birth. Lenormant de Tournehem rids her\neven of this slur by making his nephew, Lenormant d'Etioles, marry\nher, giving the young couple half his fortune for dowry, and the\npromise of the rest when he dies--also he grants him a splendid\ntown-house, as splendid a country seat. And consequential\nself-respecting little Lenormant d'Etioles is lord of Etioles, amongst\nother seignories. So Jane Fish appears as Madame Lenormant d'Etioles,\nseductive, beautiful, accomplished, to whose house repair the new\nphilosophy, the wits, and artists. She has a certain sense of virtue;\nindeed openly vows that no one but the king shall ever come between\nher and her lord. But, deep in her heart, she has harboured a fierce\nambition--that the king shall help her to keep her bond. She puts\nforth all her gifts, all her powers, to win to the strange goal;\nconfides it to her worldly mother and \"uncle,\" Lenormant de Tournehem;\nfinds keen allies therein to the reaching of that strange goal. The\ndeath of the Ch\u00e2teauroux clears the way. At a masked ball the king is\nintrigued as to the personality of a beautiful woman who plagues him\nwith her art; he orders the unmasking. Madame Lenormant d'Etioles\nstands revealed, drops her handkerchief as by accident; the whisper\nruns through the Court that \"the handkerchief has been thrown!\" The\nking stoops and picks it up. A few evenings later she is smuggled into\nthe \"private apartments.\" She goes again a month later; in the morning\nis seized with sudden terror--she daren't go back to her angry lord\nlest he do her grievous harm; he will have missed her. The king is\ntouched; allows her to hide from henceforth in the secret apartments;\npromises the beautiful creature a lodging, her husband's banishment,\nand early acknowledgment as titular mistress--before the whole Court\nat Easter, says the pious Great One. But he has to join the army to\nplay the Conqueror at Fontenoy; and it is later in the year\n(September) before Madame d'Etioles is presented to the Court in a\nvast company and proceeds to the queen's apartments to kiss hands on\nappointment. Thus was Jeanne Poisson raised to the great aristocracy\nof France in her twenty-third year as Marquise de Pompadour.\n\nBoucher had been one of the brilliant group of artists of the\nd'Etioles' circle. That the Pompadour's influence had much effect upon\nhis position at Court for a year or two is unlikely; for she had to\nfight for possession of the king day and night, as the Ch\u00e2teauroux\nhad done, against the queen's party and the unscrupulous enmity of\nMaurepas. To set down Boucher's favour at Court to her is ridiculous.\n\nHe was painting for the queen's apartments at thirty-one when the\nPompadour was a school-girl of twelve. But in the year following her\nrise to power, Boucher painted four pictures for the large room of the\nDauphin, which were \"placed elsewhere\"; and, the year after that, he\nwas at work upon two pictures for the bedroom of the king at the\ncastle of Marly. It is likely enough that the Pompadour directed this\norder. She had almost immediately secured the office of the\nDirector-General of Buildings, which covered the direction of the\nroyal art treasures, for \"uncle\" Lenormant de Tournehem, who was also\na friend of the artist. And from this year it is significant that\nBoucher paints no more for the opposing camp of the Queen and Dauphin.\n\nHe was now giving all his strength to the \"Rape of Europa\" that he\npainted for the competition ordered by the Academy at the command of\nLenormant de Tournehem in the king's name, in which ten chosen\nAcademicians were to paint subjects in their own style for six prizes\nand a gold medal, to be awarded in secret vote by the competing\nartists themselves. Boucher won, by his amiable nature, the good-will\nof them all by proposing that they should so arrange as to share the\nprizes equally, and thus prevent any sense of soreness inevitable in\nthe losers.\n\nBut greatly as he won the good-fellowship of his fellow-artists by it,\nthis picture caused a murmur to rise amongst the critics who,\naforetime loud in his praise, now began to complain of his \"abuse of\nrose tints\" in the painting of the female nude. The fact was that\nDiderot and the men of the New Philosophy were turning their eyes to\nthe whole foundations upon which France was built, art as well as\nsociety, and were beginning to demand of art \"grandeur and morality in\nits subjects.\" They were soon to be clamouring for \"the statement of a\ngreat maxim, a lesson for the spectator.\" Diderot, with bull-like\ncourage, picked out the greatest, and turned upon Boucher, blaming him\nfor triviality.\n\nThe nations, weary of war, concluded the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in\nthe October of 1748. No sooner was peace concluded than Louis\nrelapsed into his old habit of dandified indolence and profligate\nease; and, putting from him his duties as the lord of a great people,\nhe gave himself up to shameless intrigues. He allowed the Pompadour to\nusurp his magnificence and to rule over the land. He yielded himself\nutterly, if sometimes sulkily, to her domination; and for sixteen\nyears she was the most powerful person at Court, the greatest force in\nthe state--making and unmaking ministers, disposing of office,\nhonours, titles, pensions. All political affairs were discussed and\narranged under her guidance; ministers, ambassadors, generals\ntransacted their business in her stately boudoirs; the whole patronage\nof the sovereign was dispensed by her pretty hands; the prizes of the\nChurch, of the army, of the magistracy could be obtained solely\nthrough her favour and good-will. Her energy must have been\nprodigious. Possessed of extraordinary talents and exquisite tastes,\nshe gave full rein to them, and it was in the indulgence of her better\nqualities that Destiny brought Boucher into the friendship of this\nwonderful woman. She became not only his patron but his pupil,\nengraving several of his designs.\n\nBut this, her sovereignty over the king, easy and light in its outward\nseeming, was a haggard nightmare to the calculating woman who had so\nlonged for it. She knew no single hour's rest from the night she won\nto the king's bed. She had to fight her enemies, secret and open, for\npossession of the king's will, day and night; and she fought--with\nrare courage. She won by consummate skill and unending pluck. She made\nherself an essential part of the king's freedom from care. The Court\nparty fought her for power with constant vigilance. Maurepas brought\nall his unscrupulous art, all his ironic mimicry, all his vile jibes\nand unchivalrous hatred to bear against her. He had made himself a\nnecessity to the king; and he never slept away a chance of injuring\nher. He knew no mercy, no nobility, no pity. He made her the detested\nobject of the people. With his own hands he penned the witty verses\nand epigrams that were sung and flung about the streets of Paris.\n\nBut she had an enemy more subtle than any at the Court--hour by hour\nshe had to dispute the king with the king's boredom. And it was in the\neffort to do so that she created her celebrated theatre in the\nprivate apartments, calling Boucher and others to her aid in the doing\nof it. Here the noblest of France vied with each other to obtain the\nsmallest part to play, an instrument in its orchestra, an invitation\nto its performances.\n\nBoucher left the Opera to become its decorator in 1748, and did not\nreturn until her death. For her, he also decorated her beautiful rooms\nat Bellevue. She bought at high prices many of his greatest\nmasterpieces.\n\nThe Pompadour's power so greatly increased that she openly took\ncommand of the king's will; dared and succeeded in getting his\nfavourite Maurepas banished; and herself took to the use of the kingly\n\"we.\" Her rascally father was created Lord of Marigny; her brother,\nwhom the king liked well and called \"little brother,\" was created\nMarquis de Vandi\u00e8res; her only child, Alexandrine, signed her name as\na princess of the blood royal, and would have been married to the\nblood royal had she not caught the small-pox and died. She amassed a\nprivate fortune, castles, and estates such as no mistress had dreamed\nof; and into them she poured art treasures that cost the nation\nthirty-six millions of money. She created the porcelain factory of\nS\u00e8vres, kept keen watch over the Gobelins looms, and founded the great\nMilitary School of St. Cyr amidst work that would have kept several\nstatesmen busy, and of deadly intrigues at Court that would have\nbroken the spirit of many a brilliant man.\n\nIt was in her hectic desire to keep the king from being bored that she\nstooped, and made Boucher stoop, to the employment of his high\nartistry in the painting of a series of indecent pictures wherewith to\ntickle the jaded desires of Boredom, and thereby gave rise to the\nwidespread impression that Boucher's art was ever infected by base\ndesign. But Boucher was, at his very worst, but a healthy animal; and\neven in these secret works for the king he did not reach so low as did\nmany an artist of more pious memory who painted with no excuse but his\nown pleasure.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the Pompadour has been blamed too much for this\nevil act, and too much forgotten for her splendid patronage of the man\nwho, under it and during these great years of his forties, produced a\nseries of masterpieces that place him in the foremost rank of the\npainters of his century. It is impossible to reckon the number of the\npastorals and Venus-pieces that his master-hand painted and loved to\npaint, during these the supreme years of his genius. It is significant\nthat they were painted during the years that saw the Pompadour in\nsupreme power.\n\nBoucher was so firmly established in 1750, his forty-seventh year,\nthat he moved into a new house in the Rue Richelieu, near the Palais\nRoyal. Disappointed in not receiving a studio and apartments at the\nLouvre, he was allowed to use a studio in the king's library. He was\nnow making money so easily that he was able to collect pictures and\nprecious stones and the gaily coloured curiosities that appealed to\nhis tastes.\n\nThe critics were becoming more and more censorious; and one of them\nhits true with the comment that in his pastorals his shepherdesses\nlook as if they had stepped over from the Opera and would soon be off\nagain thereto.\n\nIn his forty-eighth year Boucher's art was at its most luminous\nstage--his atmosphere clear and subtle and exquisitely rendered; his\nyellows golden; his whites satin-like and silvery; his flesh-tones\nupon the nude bodies of his goddesses unsurpassed by previous art. The\nbeauty of it all was not to last much longer.\n\nLenormant de Tournehem died suddenly in the November of 1751; the\nPompadour's brother, Abel Poisson de Vandi\u00e8res, was appointed\nDirector-General in his stead at the age of twenty-five--and soon\nafterwards, on the death of his father, created Marquis de Marigny--a\nshy, handsome youth, a gentleman and an honourable fellow, whom the\nking liked well, and against whom his sister's sole complaint was that\nhe lacked the brazen effrontery of the courtiers of the day. No man\ndid more for the advancement of the art of his time. A pension of a\nthousand livres falling vacant, the young fellow secured it for\nBoucher; and almost immediately afterwards, a studio becoming vacant\nat the Louvre owing to the death of Coypel, first painter to the king,\nBoucher came to his coveted home, eagerly moving in with his family as\nsoon as its wretched state could be put into repair.\n\nThe decoration of the new wing to the palace at Fontainebleau brought\nthe commission for the painting of the ceiling and the principal\npicture in the Council Chamber to Boucher, who had already decorated\nthe Dining-Room. This was the period of his painting the \"Rising\" and\nthe \"Setting of the Sun\" for the Pompadour, now in the Watteau\ncollection, two canvases that were always favourites with the painter,\nbitterly as they were assailed by the critic Grimm.\n\nHe was turning out so much work that it was impossible to give as much\ncare to his pictures as he ought. For he refused sternly, his life\nlong, to raise his prices; by consequence he had to create a larger\namount of work in order to meet his expenditure. It was about this\ntime that Reynolds, passing through Paris, went to visit him and found\nhim painting on a huge canvas without models or sketches. \"On\nexpressing my surprise,\" writes Reynolds, \"he replied that he had\nconsidered the model as necessary during his youth until he had\ncompleted his study of art, but that he had not used one for a long\ntime past.\"\n\nHe soon had not the time, not only to paint from nature but even to\ngive his pictures the work necessary to complete them. The feverish\nhaste which took possession of him in his frantic endeavour to meet\nthe vast demand for his pictures, and the eager efforts of his\nengravers to satisfy the public call for engravings after his works,\ngave him less and less leisure to joy in their doing. And his eyesight\nbegan to fail. His flesh-tints deepened to a reddish hue; and he\nstands baffled before his work, suspecting his sight, since what every\none cries out upon as being bright vermilion, he only sees as a dull\nearthy colour. Boucher has topped the height of his achievement; he\nhas to \"descend the other side of the hill.\" Boucher begins to grow\nold.\n\nIn Boucher's fifty-first year an ugly intrigue of the queen's party at\nCourt to sap the Pompadour's influence over the king by drawing away\nthe king's affections towards Madame de Choiseul-Romanet, a reckless\nyoung beauty of the Court, brought about a strange alliance. The Count\nde Stainville, one of the Pompadour's bitterest enemies, was shown the\nking's letter of invitation to his young kinswoman; and he, deeply\nwounded in his pride that his kinswoman should have been offered to\nthe king, went to the Pompadour and exposed the plot. A close\nalliance followed; and De Stainville thenceforth became her chief\nguide in affairs of state. It was at her instance that the king called\nhim to be his Prime Minister, raising him to the Duchy of Choiseul--a\nname he made illustrious as one of the greatest Ministers of France.\n\nIn his fifty-second year Boucher was appointed to the directorship of\nthe Gobelins looms, to the huge delight of the weavers and all\nconcerned with the tapestry factory. This was the year of his painting\nthe famous portrait of the Pompadour, to whom he several times paid\nthis \"tribute of immorality.\" For the Gobelins looms he produced many\nhandsome designs; and he was painting with astounding industry. But\nhis hand's skill began to falter. His art shows weariness in his\nsixtieth year, and sickness fell upon him, and held him in servitude\nnow with rare moments of respite. The critics, notoriously Diderot,\nwere now attacking him with shameless virulence. Boucher passed it all\nby; but he felt the change that was taking place in the public taste.\n\nThe ideas of the New Philosophy were infecting public opinion; the Man\nof Feeling had arisen in the land; and France, humiliated in war, and\nresenting the follies and the greed of her shameless privileged class,\nwas openly resenting it and all its works. Choiseul had planted his\nstrength deep in the people's party, and was come near to being its\ngod. His masterly mind had checked Frederick of Prussia to the North;\nand the nations, exhausted by the struggle, signed the Peace of Paris\nin 1763. Choiseul, with France at peace abroad, turned to the blotting\nout of the turbulent order of the Jesuits at home. Their attempt to\nend the Pompadour's relations with the king made this powerful woman\neager to complete his design; the chance was soon to come, and the\nOrder was abolished from France and its vast property seized by the\nstate.\n\nThe Pompadour lived but a short while to enjoy her triumph. Worn out\nby her superhuman activities, assailed by debt, she fell ill of a\nracking cough, dying on the 15th of April, 1764, in her forty-second\nyear, keeping her ascendancy over the king and the supreme power in\nFrance to her last hour. Death found her transacting affairs of state.\n\nLouis, weary of his servitude, had only a heartless epigram to cast\nat the body of the dead woman as she passed to her last resting-place.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE END\n\n\nThe death of the Pompadour robbed Boucher of a friend; but her\nbrother, Marigny, remained faithfully attached to the old artist, and\nseized every chance to honour him. On the death of Carle van Loo,\nBoucher, at sixty-two, was made first painter to the king, with all\nhis pensions and privileges that were consistent with this the supreme\nappointment in the art world.\n\nThere had been serious intention of making Boucher the head of the\nEcole des El\u00e8ves Proteg\u00e9s; he had the art of making himself liked and\nof inspiring the love of the arts. He was very popular with the\nstudents and artists, owing to his kindliness, his eagerness to render\nservice, his readiness to encourage the youngsters or to console them.\n\nWhen the riot took place, provoked by the Academicians by their award\nof the Prix de Rome in 1767, the students insulted the Academicians,\nbut hailed Boucher with enthusiastic applause. The reason was not far\nto seek. When a student came to the old master for advice he did not\n\"play the pontiff,\" and, scorning the false dignity of big phrases, he\ntook the brush in his hand and showed the way out of all difficulties\nby simplehearted example, despising rules, and putting himself out in\norder to make things clear to a young artist.\n\nHowever, the Academicians feared he would be an unorthodox master for\nyouth, and appointed another in his place.\n\nA long and serious illness thwarted his keen energies. Diderot was\ngiving himself up to outrageous violence against him. If the old\npainter exhibited at the Salon, Diderot fiercely assailed his art; if\nhe did not exhibit, Diderot as bitterly assailed him for his\nnegligences. Above all, he attacked Boucher in that he did not paint\nwhat Diderot would have painted--but could not. \"When he paints\ninfants,\" cries Diderot, \"you will not find one employed in a real act\nof life--studying his lesson, reading, writing, stripping hemp.\"\n\nPoor unfortunate infants! for whom Philosophy could find no happier\njoy in life than stripping hemp! Boucher was but an artist. He\npainted his generation as far as he could see it, and, with all his\nfaults and weaknesses, he never debauched his art with foreign and\nalien things that had no part in the nation's life; he painted fair\nFrance into his landscapes, not a make-believe land he did not know\nwith preposterous Greek ruins; and best of all, to his eternal honour,\nhe painted infants glad in their gladness to be alive, with no desire\nto send their happy little bodies to school, with no sickly ambition\nto make them into budding philosophers, with no thought of making them\npose and lie as Men of Feeling. He had no joy in setting their little\nbodies to toil--in making them \"teach a lesson to the spectator,\" in\nmaking them stoop their little shoulders to the \"picking of hemp.\"\n\nHe continued to paint as he had always painted--except that he painted\nless well. The wreath of roses was wilting on a grey head. The blood\njigged less warmly in the frail body. The features showed pallid--the\neyes haggard. The sight failed. The hand alone kept something of its\ncunning.\n\nHe went to Holland with his friend Randon du Boisset, but health\nshrank farther from him. Diderot had near spent his last jibe.\n\nIn 1768, Boucher's sixty-fifth year, the neglected queen went to her\ngrave. The king's grief and contrition and vows to amend his life came\ntoo late, and lasted little longer than the drying of the floods of\ntears over the body of his dead consort. A year later he was become\nthe creature of a pretty woman of the gutters, whom he caused to be\nmarried to the Count du Barry--the infamously famous Madame du Barry.\n\nBut neither the remonstrances of Choiseul with the king against this\nfurther degradation of the throne of France, nor his unconcealed scorn\nof the upstart countess, nor the dangerous enemy he made for himself\nthereby, signified now to Boucher, first painter to the king.\n\nBoucher was failing. His son was a prig and a disappointment. His two\nfavourite pupils, Baudoin and Deshayes, who had married his two girls,\ndied.\n\nTo the Salon of 1769 he sent his \"Caravan of Bohemians.\" It was his\nlast display. He had been going about for some time like a gaunt ghost\nof his former self, afflicted with all the ills inevitable to a life\nfeverishly consumed in work and the pursuit of pleasure.\n\nThey went to his studio at five of the clock one May morning, and\nfound him seated at his easel, before a canvas of Venus, dead, with\nthe paint-filled brush fallen out of his fingers.\n\nSo passed he away on the 30th of May 1770, in his sixty-seventh year.\n\nWhen Boucher died, the generation of which he was the limner was near\ncome to its violent end. The rosy carnivals and gay gallantries of his\nage gave way to the blood-stained romance and fierce tempest of the\nRevolution. The garrets of the old curiosity-shops received the\ndiscarded canvases of the master. His shepherds and shepherdesses were\nput to rout by the Romans of his pupil, citizen David. The old order\nwas brought into contempt and overthrown. And with it, Boucher's art,\nlike much that was gracious and charming and good in the evil thing,\nwent down also, and was overwhelmed for a while.\n\nFor a while only. For just as, out of the blood and terror of the\nRevolution, a real France arose, phnix-wise, from the ruin, and in\nbeing born, whilst putting off the vilenesses of the thing from which\nshe sprang, took on also to herself the gracious and winsome qualities\nthat place her amongst the most fascinating peoples of the ages; so\nBoucher has come into his kingdom again--the most gracious of painters\nthat the years have yielded."

                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n        a. One bed, or folding cot,\n        b. One oil stove,\n        c. One lamp,\n        d. Enough supplies of all kinds sufficient for six months,\n        e. Pots, pans, kettles, etc.\nIt is needless to say that positions in Manila and Iloilo were now at\na premium.\n\nWas it possible that teachers were to be sent to places where even the\nnecessaries of life could not be obtained! Was it possible that many\nwould be sent to places so remote that for six months no fresh\nsupplies could be gotten! A mass meeting was held at once, and a\ncommittee was appointed to send a cablegram to the Associated Press\npetitioning aid from the American people at large. Realizing what\nconsternation would be created throughout the United States by such a\nmessage, two of the teachers leaped into a carriage at the close of\nthe meeting and a few moments later were closeted with the chief\nexecutive of the department. As a result the committee was persuaded\nnot to send the cablegram to the Associated Press until by courtesy it\nhad been sent to the President. Of course, this diplomatic move tided\naffairs over and the teachers who had flatly refused to budge from\nManila now agreed to go on to their stations, being assured that\nwhatever action was best would be taken.\n\nThe day had come when we must separate. We were to enter an untried\nand an unknown field. It was fitting that we have a final joyous\nmeeting, so the best orchestra in the archipelago was engaged and we\n\"chased the hours with flying feet\" until dawn so that whatever might\ncome to us in that unknown future upon which we were entering each\nwould hold in pleasant memory our last evening together.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER III. - A DRAMA IN ACTUAL LIFE.\n\n\nAlmost every one heeded the warning to go to his station forearmed\nwith at least necessaries of life, but, as it had never fallen to the\nlot of the writer to cook, he refused to learn at that late day, so he\ntook no pot, no pan, no kettle, putting his future into the hands of\nan uncertain fate and relying upon the unknown hospitality of the\nFilipino.\n\nBacalod, the capital of the province of Occidental Negros, was our\ndestination. The second morning after leaving Manila, we awoke with\nthe \"Kilpatrick\" lying at anchor in a shallow bay. We were several\nmiles from the shore and nothing in sight indicated that we had\nreached a place of any importance. Late the night before we had been\nawakened by the loud, sharp ringing of the ship's bells, accompanied\nby the reversal of the engines and a general disturbance awaking the\ncrew. So our first impressions on coming on deck were that we had run\naground. But the captain assured us that everything was ship-shape and\nthat this was the nearest point of approach to Capiz, a town of\nconsiderable importance on the island of Panay, where a body of troops\nwas to embark for home. Not even the grass hut of a native was in\nsight. Search as we would, not a sign was seen of a stream flowing\ninto the sea, indicating the probable presence of a town. There was\nnot a sign of life of any kind save one lone column of thin, blue\nsmoke that arose from the side of a mountain miles away. One would\nhave thought that we were explorers of three hundred years ago lying\noff the shore of some unknown land.\n\nAfter breakfast the steam launch, together with all the boats, was\nlowered, and several of us who had determined to miss no opportunity\nto gather information about the islands took our places in the launch\nby the side of the ship's mate, and steamed away across the water with\na long line of boats strung out in the rear. We headed away toward a\ngroup of cocoanut trees, and about an hour later stepped ashore on a\npile of decayed coral rocks that extended some twenty or thirty feet\nout into the water, thus forming the only landing place of a town of\nseveral thousands of people and of considerable commercial importance.\n\nA few moments after we had landed, an army wagon drawn by a\nmagnificent pair of mules came up out of a tropical jungle along a\nnarrow road. We clambered into the wagon and were soon lost in the\ndepths of foliage from which we had just seen the vehicle emerge.\n\nLong waving bamboos with their plumy leafage hung over the road from\neach side, meeting and overlapping in the center until they formed an\narchway so dense that the tropical sun now high in the heavens\npenetrated it only at intervals. At times the wagon sank up to the\nhubs in the soft earth, and the muscles of the mules stood out like\nwhip-cords under the skin as they drew us forward.\n\nAt a sharp turn in the road we came upon the first division of troops\nthat was to embark for home. The look of joy upon their sun-browned\nfaces was inexpressible. Their work was done, and with elastic step\nand smiling faces they saluted us as they passed by. The reign of\nforce was at an end; it was going out with them; the reign of peace\nhad begun; it was coming in with us.\n\nIn the afternoon when we returned from the town the last of the troops\nhad arrived and, as we drove up, the bugle was sounding the call to\nsupper. We noticed native women mingling with the troops and, indeed,\na native woman was in constant attention waiting upon one of the\nsoldiers with whom we ate. Her clothes were clean, her hair was nicely\ncombed, and her general appearance was neat. She seemed to anticipate\nthe slightest wish of the soldier with whom she was. She brought him\nwater to drink, cleaned his plate after the meal and saw that his\nknife, fork, and spoon were put into his haversack.\n\nWe had now finished supper and the launch had returned for the last\nload of troops. The lieutenant in command of the company gave the\norder to \"fall in\"; the men shouldered their rifles and fell into\nline. \"Forward, march!\" called the lieutenant, and the column swept\nforward towards the boats. The women had until now restrained\nthemselves, but, as their husbands marched away never to return, their\nfeelings could no longer be restrained. One young woman of about\neighteen, who was leaning against a rock by the roadside sobbing, when\nher husband passed, leaped up in frenzy of passionate love and caught\nthe rifle from his shoulder. Her first impulse seemed to be to throw\nthe gun away, but suddenly realizing the futility of such an act she\nburst into tears, shouldered the rifle herself and marched on by his\nside. Another woman of more mature age threw her arms around the legs\nof a tall stalwart man, and drew him bodily from the line.\n\nBut the troops marched on and entered the boats. One woman who had\nbeen unnoticed before came down into the shallow water and caught hold\nof our last boat as if to prevent its leaving, while others stood\nmingling their sobs with the sounds of the wavelets as they broke on\nthe sands. As we passed away, an expectant mother, standing in bold\noutline against the twilight sky, threw up her hands in an agony of\ndespair and then sank upon the stones. The curtain had fallen upon a\ndrama in actual life deeper in pathos than any other we had ever seen\nor ever expected to see. Depth of passion, depth of love! Who can\nfathom the human heart?\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. - WHAT THE TEACHERS DID.\n\n\nThere is a remarkable sameness about the towns in the Philippines.\n\nThey all have a large open square about the middle of the town, around\nthree sides of which are Chinese stores, unless one side lies open to\nthe sea, and on the fourth is the great stone ecclesia. The streets\nrun at right angles to one another and divide up the town into\ncreditable squares.\n\nEverybody in the Philippines lives up-stairs, for the ground is so\nsoaked with water during the rainy season that it is a menace to\nhealth to live upon the ground floor. So even the poorest nippa hut\nis built upon stakes four or five feet above the ground.\n\nBacalod is a typical Philippine town. As we landed, a broad open\nsquare was spread out before us. Two sides of the square were lined\nwith two-story houses in which were Chinese stores below and Filipino\nhomes above. On the third side stood the great stone church in whose\nmassive tower the clock was striking the hour of four, while the\nfourth lay open to the sea that had borne us thither.\n\nWe landed, but it was in a method new to us and one not usually\nemployed by the traveling public.\n\nWhen our sail boat ran aground on the sandy bottom a hundred yards or\nmore from the shore, a crowd of Filipino men who were on the beach\nslowly rolled up their pantaloons and waded out to the rescue,--for\nthe money that was in it. The boat's crew elevated their trousers'\nlegs also and slided down into the water. Each of us then straddled\nthe neck of a Filipino standing in the water and was held by ankles to\nbe steadied while our biped mounts proceeded to the shore.\n\nWe were now on the ground and face to face with the situation. To give\nthe reader an idea of the actual conditions met by the first teachers\nwho went to the Islands, the following is copied from the instructions\ngiven us in Manila:\n    1. There shall be two sessions daily of all schools, and the\n    last hour of the morning session shall be devoted solely to\n    instructing the Filipino teachers.\n\n    2. In cases where teachers are sent to a town in which there\n    is no school-house, they are expected to secure the aid of the\n    people and have one built.\n\n    3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is\n    stopped.\n\n    4. All supplies must be kept under lock and key. In towns\n    where there is no case or box to lock the supplies in, and it\n    is also impossible to get the town council to furnish a case,\n    a requisition may be sent to Manila, and, if an appropriation\n    can be secured, one will be made and sent out.\n\nThus it can be easily seen that we were indeed pioneers. In many\nplaces no school-house was to be found, and in some cases it was even\ndifficult to get the town council to provide a case in which to keep\nthe supplies.\n\nThe work of the teachers was, in short; to \"make the English language\nthe basis of instruction in the public schools.\" On our arrival at\nBacalod two schools were found in progress, for some soldiers had been\ndetailed for the work here previous to our coming. One of these was\nfor boys and the other, for girls. Thus the work here had been in a\nmeasure simplified, but complications that had arisen at Talisay, one\nof the largest and richest towns on the island, demanded a change of\nteachers and the writer was assigned to the place as superintendent.\n\nHere an attempt had been made to start a school but it had failed\nignominiously and a system of education was to be put into operation\nfrom the very start.\n\nThe Filipinos are not strong advocates of co-education, so separate\nschools were to be started for the boys and the girls. The one for the\nboys was gotten well in hand before the one for the girls was\nattempted at all.\n\nA few days after reaching the town and securing a home the\npresidente of the town had it publicly announced that the following\nMonday morning at eight o'clock a public school for boys would be\nopened in a building that had been rented for the purpose by the\nmunicipal council. About the middle of the afternoon of the same day a\nman beat a little drum throughout all the streets of the town to call\nthe people out and the town clerk announced both in Spanish and in the\nnative language that this public school would begin at the time and\nplace mentioned above; that instruction would be free to all who came;\nthat the government would furnish all supplies; and that instruction\nwould be given in the English language. A native principal and\nassistants were employed and everything was ready to begin.\n\nThe official report of the result is as follows:\n    Boys' public school of Talisay, Negros, P. I., began November\n    4, 1901. Forty-three boys present at eight o'clock. Forty-one\n    of them knew \"good morning\" and \"good afternoon\" but do not\n    know the distinction between them. Two of them speak simple\n    Spanish. At eight forty-five, eight more, who had been\n    attending an early morning private school, came in together.\n\n    The books they brought were so varied and so different from\n    one another that it seemed impossible to bring any reasonable\n    degree of order out of such a chaos, and so, after struggling\n    vainly for about a week with the problem, the superintendent\n    by one fell stroke removed everything in use and put in a\n    uniform system, and from that day on the English language has\n    been the basis of instruction in the public schools of\n    Talisay. The work was of necessity very slow at first, but by\n    the end of a year two schools were going nicely and a number\n    of the brightest boys and girls had made really excellent\n    progress.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER V. - A \"BAILE.\"\n\n\nNot long after the arrival of our party at Bacalod we received an\ninvitation to a \"baile\" given in our honor by the inhabitants of\nSilay, a town some ten or twelve miles up the northern coast and one\nnoted for its social life. The invitation was accepted with pleasure,\nand about the middle of the afternoon on the day appointed we were\nclad in the immaculate white of the tropics and steaming away up the\ncoast on board a launch sent for our conveyance. Twilight was still\nlingering on the path of day when we anchored just off shore at the\ntown. A row-boat containing the officials of the city came out to meet\nus and, in due season, we were ushered into a spacious drawing-room\nfilled almost to overflowing with the \u00e9lite of the town. The \u00e9lite of\ntowns in the Philippines speak Spanish, and, as only one or two of our\nparty could at that time boast of more than a formal acquaintance with\nthe Castilian tongue, the exchange of ideas that evening between us\nand the Filipinos was of necessity not very rapid.\n\nThe necessity of easy communication between us was rendered somewhat\nless indispensable by the announcement of supper as soon as we were\nrested from our trip. When we had taken our places at the table a\nyoung Filipino about twenty-five years of age arose and gave a lengthy\ntoast to the recent union of the Philippines with the United States.\n\nBut as we Americans were unable to scale the dizzy heights of his\nclimaxes or sink to the depths of his pathos, we forewent the\npleasures of his oratory and turned our attention to the savory odor\nof lamb, chicken, and roast pig that came slyly stealing up our\nnostrils to send us nerve dispatches about the gastronomic delights of\nour not far distant future.\n\nAt last the toast was ended and the world-wide soup ushered in a long\ntrain of things good to eat, served in a style better fitted to the\ndelights of the appetite than to the formalities of dinners, for, as\nsoon as the pleasant task of one dish was completed by any one, the\nnext was served him at once regardless of the progress made by the\nothers at the table.\n\nThe last course was dulce. The new-comers to the Philippines will\nnot be long in making the acquaintance of this dish, and at all\nmeetings, both public and private, where eatables are served, it\nperforms an important part. It is anything sweet, and it may vary all\nthe way from an india-rubber-like black mixture of cocoanut milk and\ndirty sugar to a really toothsome and respectable confection. No\nmatter of what materials a dish is composed, just so long as it is\nsweet, it is dulce.\n\nAfter paying our respects to this last course, we arose from the table\nand entered a great rectangular room from the center of whose ceiling\nhung a large glass chandelier, a mass of shimmering crystals. In the\nchairs around the room were the wealth, the youth, and the beauty of\nthe town.\n\nThe first and also the last number of every Filipino dance of any\nformality is the \"rigodon.\" The dancers are arranged in a square, or\nquadrangle according to the number participating, and are then led\nthrough a tangled maze of figures that so utterly bewilders the novice\nthat he sinks into his chair at the end of the dance wondering how it\nall came to pass.\n\nWe Americans breathed a sigh of relief when the \"rigodon\" ended, and\nmustered fresh courage for social conquests in the waltz that was now\nbreathing forth from the trembling strings. My companion in the first\ndance had been the young lady by whose side I had sat at dinner. But\nit now became necessary to search for another, so I prudently waited\nto see how partners were chosen, and made no mistake when a few\nmoments later I faced one of the most luscious looking se\u00f1oritas on\nthe opposite side of the room and offered her my arm. My eyes must\nhave told the story that my lips could not utter in Spanish, for she\nsmiled upon me sweetly, arose, and put her hand upon my shoulder. My\narm encircled her waist and I began to waltz. Unfortunately my\ncompanion did not follow, but began to hop up and down in a manner\nmost distressing. Supposing the attack to be only temporary, I paused\nand, much to my relief, she soon showed signs of recovery; and in the\ncourse of time she came to a standstill looking up into my face in an\ninquiring sort of way, apparently wondering why St. Vitus had not paid\nhis respects to me also. A second attempt to follow the music met with\nresults similar to the first, and during the third attempt, which\nseemed to be trembling on the verge of a failure, St. Vitus let go my\ncompanion and seized me with such vigor that she, who was small even\nfor a Filipino, was gathered up bodily and taken around the room at\nsuch a pace that her toes touched the floor only at far distant\nintervals.\n\nAt this point my devotion to the shrine of Terpsichore ceased from\nforce of circumstances and I seated myself in one of the most\ncomfortable chairs in sight that I might carry out a previously formed\nplan to study the Filipino somewhat critically as he appears in\nsociety.\n\nThe first thing that impressed me as the dancers passed up and down\nthe room was the flash of diamonds. Nearly every woman in the room had\non a brooch that flashed the colors of the rainbow at every turn.\n\nAlmost all of them wore one or more rings that showed up brilliantly\nunder the chandelier. Many of the men too, especially the young men,\nwore gems that appeared to be exquisite. A closer inspection showed\nthat some of the gems had flaws and others were of a poor color, but\nno one would have denied that, taken as a whole, it was a really\nbeautiful display.\n\nThe dress of the ladies was richly colored. Many of their skirts were\nof silk covered with hand embroidered flowers, and their filmy pina\nwaists and broad collar pieces were rich with needle-work. They all\nwore a kind of heelless velvet slipper, very common as a dress shoe in\nthe Philippines, or high-heeled patent leather shoes with neatly\nfitting black stockings.\n\nThe men were dressed in white coats and white pantaloons or black\ncoats and white pantaloons. White shirts and collars, together with\nall sorts and styles of cravats and low-cut patent leather shoes with\nhighly colored socks completed their dress.\n\nIt was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money;\nthat they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a\ntable loaded with good things was a fact to which all of us were\nenthusiastic witnesses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VI. - A SKETCH OF LIFE IN THE PHILIPPINES.\n\n\nHouse-keeping in the Philippines presents some interesting phases. Our\nclub of American officials decided to run a mess, so we employed a\ncook and a house boy, then each of us provided himself with a personal\nservant, making a total of six servants for four men--it takes about\nthis proportion of servants to live in any sort of comfort in the\nPhilippines--and launched ourselves boldly upon the sea of domestic\neconomy. But there were shoals ahead of us, for the question of\nregulating servants is one of no small importance in the Philippines,\nand one of its most disadvantageous features is the long chain of\ndependents that usually attends it.\n\nWe gave the cooks so much a day with which to buy supplies in the\nlocal market, for our own table, making him render a daily list of\nexpenditures, and a fixed amount besides to purchase rice and fish for\nhimself and the other servants. Of course, if they wished to vary\ntheir diet and get chicken and fresh pork, which could be had at far\ndistant intervals, it was wholly a matter of their option, but the\nallowance was made on the basis of so much rice and fish a day for\neach. This allowance was about fifteen cents a day in Spanish coin per\nservant.\n\nThus far all was well. We had agreed to give the cook eight dollars a\nmonth in Spanish money, thinking that good wages would procure good\nservice, but the visions of affluence that floated before him on such\nfloods of wealth were so alluring that they drew him from the kitchen\nto the cooler veranda. In less than a week he had employed an\nassistant at four dollars a month; in less than another week that\nassistant had employed him an assistant at two dollars a month; in\nless than another week that assistant to the assistant had employed\nhim an assistant at the princely salary of fifty cents a month; and\nfrom fear that the chain of dependents would end only by our having\nthe whole Filipino race attached to our culinary force, we broke up\nhouse-keeping and went boarding again, choosing that as the less of\nthe two evils.\n\nOur house furnishings were almost wholly Philippine. The table ware\nand the food on the table came from the ends of the earth. The knives\nand forks were made in Germany, the plates were manufactured in\nEngland, the glass ware and table cloth, in the United States. The\noatmeal and flour came from the United States also. The butter came\nfrom Australia, the rice from China, the salt from Russia, and the\nother eatables from sources about as various as their separate names.\n\nSwitzerland furnished the condensed milk and Illinois the canned\ncream. Nearly all of the canned fruit bore labels from Spain.\n\nThus it can easily be seen that life in the Philippines, if lived\naccording to American ideals, is dependent upon a highly developed and\nhighly complex commerce. However, the difficulties of transportation\nand the restriction of large stocks of merchandise to Manila and some\nhalf a dozen other towns, make so great a difference between country\nlife and city life that a short comparison of the two will not be out\nof place, and life in Manila may well be taken as being fairly typical\nof the latter.\n\nLife in Manila is pleasant, but expensive. It is pleasant from the\nfact that it is not only the capital but also metropolis of the\narchipelago. Thus the combination of wealth and high official position\nhas given to Manila a society of the highest and most refined type.\n\nThe process of beautifying and improving the city which is constantly\ngoing on bids fair to give us at no distant day a city of which we may\nwell be proud.\n\nBut let him who intends living well in Manila on a small income bid\nfarewell at once to so idylic a dream, for it costs much to live well\nthere. In the city of Manila one can get almost anything he wishes,\nbut it must be paid for at the price it commands. Especially in the\ncase of eatables, this price is by no means small, because to the\nfirst cost of articles must in most cases be added the expense of\ndistant shipment from American, European, or Australian ports, and not\ninfrequently the cost of long refrigeration must also be taken into\nconsideration. But, expensive though it is, it is very pleasant to\nlive there and those who have once enjoyed it often wish again to\nquaff the cup of its delights.\n\nIn strong contrast to this pleasant life is the life of the quiet\nlittle hamlet away in the distant islands. Indeed, the Filipino from\nthe distant town, who by some good fortune has been to Manila, or, by\na coup de main, has studied in one of the Manila colleges, is looked\nup to in a true hero-worshiping attitude by all who either know him or\nhear of his fame. Life in such a place is one long state of harmless\ninactivity. Not a wave of trouble from the great outer world ever\ndisturbs its peaceful repose. One lounges forever in an air of\nindolent ease and extreme aversion to anything approaching what might\nbe called a respectable effort.\n\nOne arises in the morning about the time the sun's first rays silver\nthe top leaves of the cocoanut trees and then stirs around until nine\nor ten o'clock, when it is found expedient to avoid a further exposure\nto the sun. From then until about five o'clock in the afternoon it is\nbest to take things as they come, even though one of those things be a\nFilipino dinner. But then you may have your vehiclo attached to a\nyoung bull with a ring in his nose and go for a drive. If it is the\ndry season you will probably enjoy the drive unless you object to the\nfrequent clouds of dust swept along by the evening wind. If it is in\nthe rainy season your pleasure will depend to a considerable extent\nupon how wet you get; but, whether the season be wet or dry, your\npleasure will be regulated largely by the state of harmony existing\nbetween the driver and the bull.\n\nIn these quiet secluded nooks successive generations of Filipinos are\nborn, reared, grow old and die in an even chain of events broken only\nby the occasional erection of a new grass house on the identical spot\nwhere its predecessors have stood for ages. The son lives in the house\nof his father, cultivates the same few square feet of soil planted in\nedible roots, climbs the same cocoanut trees, follows the same winding\npath down to the stream, pounds rice in the same mortar and with the\nsame stick that his ancestors have used from time unremembered, and,\nin case of illness, curls up on a grass mat in a corner of the room\nuntil he dies or by some good fortune recovers. Beyond this narrow\nhorizon he never looks. So narrow and contracted is the life that the\nlanguages of two towns a few miles apart are so different that one\nwould scarcely recognize them as belonging to the same race of people.\n\nSuch are the two extremes of life in our new far Eastern provinces:\nthe one is active, progressive, and cosmopolitan; the other, inactive,\ndecadent, and narrow; but, whether one enjoys the first or endures the\nsecond, there comes to him after leaving a longing to lounge again in\ntropic airs and listen to the lullaby of the winds among the palms.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VII. - THE FILIPINO AT HOME.\n\n\nAs one enters a Filipino sitting-room for the first time, there is one\nfeature in the arrangement of the furniture that impresses itself upon\nhim at once, and it may be stated without fear of serious\ncontradiction that this same peculiar feature in its arrangement will\ncontinue to face him, as he enters different homes, about as certainly\nas he crosses the threshold.\n\nThe arrangement referred to is that of one large mirror, one settee,\nand some ten or a dozen chairs that appear to have had a certain\norderly affection for one another. The mirror is hung upon one of the\nlarge interior parts of the house about four feet above the floor. The\nwooden houses in the Philippines are built by setting large posts\nupright into the ground, extending into the air from twenty to thirty\nfeet. Cross timbers are fastened to these upright posts about eight or\nten feet above the ground and then not sawed off even with the posts,\nbut allowed to extend beyond them each way. The framework of the house\nis built upon these extending cross timbers, a style of building by\nwhich these large upright posts are left standing out on the inside of\nthe room from one to three feet from the walls. It is on that one of\nthese posts most nearly opposite the door that the mirror always finds\nits place. Immediately beneath the mirror is the settee; and the\nchairs are arranged in two parallel lines facing one another and at\nright angles with the ends of the settee. However odd this arrangement\nmay appear to one when he first enters a Filipino drawing-room, there\nare two things to be said in its favor. In the first place, it places\nyou face to face with the person with whom you are conversing so that\nyou can watch him,--a matter of no small moment in the Philippines. In\nthe next place, it enables you to give one of the young ladies a\nsheep's-eye in the mirror while the others present are left where\nMoses was in our much abused conundrum.\n\nThe size of the residence and the quality of its furnishings depends\nupon the wealth of the owner. But there is so vast a difference\nbetween the mode of life of the highest class and the tao, or lowest\nclass, that it is well to speak of them separately, and the great\nmiddle class of Filipinos can easily be imagined to occupy the\nintervening ground.\n\nThe rich Filipino's house is usually of wood built upon a wall of\nstone or brick from ten to fifteen feet high. The floors are kept\nhighly polished in his hallway, dressing-room, and bed-rooms. There\nare, of course, no fire-places in any of the rooms, but on some\noccasions something is needed to dry the rain-soaked atmosphere, for\neven in the dry season it has been seen to rain for five successive\ndays and nights without the cessation of a moment.\n\nA long chain of dependents is attached to the household of the rich\nFilipino. The master has his special body servant to be present at all\ntimes to do his master's bidding, in short, to be the visible\nmechanism of his master's volition. So, too, the lady of the house has\nher servant woman to do the slightest bidding of her ladyship. Then\nthere is the cook who is almost invariably a man, a house boy or two,\nand the coachman. These functionaries, with their assistants and\nassistants to the assistants, together with a servant or two for the\nexclusive service of the children, complete the economic household.\n\nSuch a family has an abundance of rice and wheat bread, also of\nchicken and fish with occasional fresh beef. They have also a good\ndeal of dulce. They regularly serve wine and frequently serve beer\non their tables.\n\nIn strong contrast with this mode of life is that of the tao. His\ndiet consists almost wholly of rice and small uncleaned fish boiled\ntogether. As a rule knife, fork, plate, and spoon find no place in his\nhousehold. The rice and fish are boiled in a pot and then allowed to\ncool in the same vessel or poured out to cool in a large earthen or\nwooden bowl. Then Mr. Tao together with Mrs. Tao and all the young\nTaos squat on their heels around the mixture and satisfy that\nintangible thing called the appetite. They do not use chop sticks as\nthe Chinese do, but the rice and fish are caught in a hollow formed by\nthe first three fingers of the right hand. The thumb is then placed\nbehind the mass. It is raised up and poised before the mouth, with a\nskill coming from the evolution of ages, when a contraction of the\nmuscles of the thumb throws the mass into the mouth with a skill that\nis marvelous to any but a Filipino. To judge from the most reliable\ninformation, the poorest class do not have an abundance of food,\nalthough it would seem that such a condition of things would be\nwell-nigh impossible. However, in a census of one hundred school\nchildren there were found six boys and four girls who declared that\nthey had never had enough to eat, and the native teacher stated that\nthis was probably true.\n\nThe wide gulf between the tao and the rich man is filled by the\ngreat middle class of Filipinos.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VIII. - VISIT TO A LEPER COLONY.\n\n\nNot far from our town was a leper colony and the first Saturday that\ncould be spared was set aside for a trip to the place. It happened\nthat none of the other Americans were at leisure on this particular\nmorning, but, rather then delay the trip or miss it altogether, the\nwriter, armed with a revolver, started out alone.\n\nThe road had been described so accurately by one who was supposed to\nknow it that it was deemed well-nigh impossible to miss the way. The\nmain highway was followed to the point where the by-path supposed to\nlead to the settlement turned off through some bamboo thickets and a\nlow tropical wood. This path led straight away towards the sea-coast\nwhere the houses of the colony were said to stand in a cocoanut grove\nby the beach.\n\nUpon arriving at the settlement, a very inhospitable reception was\nreceived from a mangy cur that growled and showed a very uninviting\nset of sharp, white teeth behind his snarling lips. The growling of\nthe dog had attracted the attention of an old man who, with age-bent\nback, was pounding rice in a mortar about fifty yards away. He turned\nslowly around and, upon seeing an intruder into the primitive quiet of\nthe place, gave a sharp, far-reaching call. The sound had scarcely\nrung through the grove when from about a dozen of the little grass\nhouses dotted here and there fifteen or twenty men armed with bolos\ncame out and gathered around the old man. A sense of my danger flashed\nupon me. Three miles from town and alone in a tropical jungle, I could\nbe almost instantly overcome by this band of bolo-men, and the only\nreport that would ever reach my people would be that I had\n\"disappeared.\" Of course, attack was by no means certain, but the\npotentiality of the situation was thrilling. A drawn revolver and the\ngleaming of its shining barrel had the effect of stopping the men, who\nseemed to be hesitating as to a course of action, until a somewhat\ndignified retreat was made to an open space in the rear from where a\nless dignified and a more hasty retreat began which did not stop short\nof Bacalod.\n\nEnough had been seen, however, even in this short visit, to give\nconvincing proof that the settlement visited was no colony of lepers;\nso, that afternoon two servant boys being taken as guides and\ninterpreters, another attempt was made to reach the goal desired.\n\nThis attempt was successful, and, after about two hours of walking, a\nlittle cluster of grass huts snugly hidden by the sea-coast came into\nview. As we approached, one would have thought it a gala-day. Some few\nchildren, apparently from six to thirteen years of age, almost wholly\nnude, were romping and playing in the open space around which the huts\nstood, and no one would ever have thought that any cloud so horrible\nas leprosy could hover over a place apparently so happy.\n\nBy the side of the path as we passed was a man and his wife setting\nout potato plants. His hands were so puffed and his fingers so short\nthat he could scarcely use them, but he was working along as best he\ncould. His wife's feet were so swollen and twisted that she walked\nonly with the greatest difficulty. We passed them by and entered the\nopen space above referred to.\n\nThe children now saw us, and those of them who could darted away like\nfrightened rabbits, each to his own burrow. An old man who was sitting\nin the warm afternoon sun on the little bamboo platform before his hut\nwas aroused from his lethargic repose by the scampering away of the\nchildren. He arose, trembling upon his tottering limbs, all drawn and\ntwisted, and hobbled away into his hut.\n\nThe children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at\nthe doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of\nthe settlement. In a few moments we were surrounded by a circle of\nhuman beings at once so repulsive and so pitiable that its graphic\nvividness can never be accurately portrayed.\n\nThe old man referred to above, having put on a pair of snow-white\npantaloons, appeared now at the doorway of his hut, followed a few\nmoments later by his wife who had evidently clothed herself in the\nbest raiment she had. At a call from the old man, all the men, women,\nand children in the settlement came out of their huts and stood in a\nline before us. The old man was spokesman and in his native visayan\ntongue made a heart-rending appeal for aid which we were powerless to\ngive. Attention was called to a leper woman, apparently about\ntwenty-five years of age, whose face had been attacked by the disease\nand whose appearance was truly pathetic. Upon her hip was a child\nabout a year and a half old and, strange to say, the child showed as\nyet no signs whatever of the disease.\n\nWhat an indissoluble enigma is life! Here in a little cluster of grass\nhuts in a secluded nook of a secluded island of an all but secluded\narchipelago was gathered together a little community of wretched\nnatives, driven by their loathsomeness from association with others\neven of the same half-savage race. Yet here, men and women loved and\nwere married, by mutual trust if not by law, and children were born of\nthe union to live forever under the unspeakable horror that\novershadowed the unfortunate parents. Love, hatred, sorrow, and\njoy--every passion that enters into the complex structure of the human\nheart even here, in this scene of sadness and despair, was playing\napparently as freely as where misfortune and disease had never crossed\nthe portals of life.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER IX. - A \"HIKE.\"\n\n\nWe were lounging lazily in our hammocks at Jimamaylan one evening in\nApril. Supper was just ended, and the soldiers in the post were\ncollected in groups here and there spinning yarns to pass away the\ntime, when a Filipino clad only in a loin cloth came down the street\nat a steadily swinging run and stopped in front of the sentry. He\nbrought the announcement that a band of ladrones had just burned a\nsugar mill and were advancing to sack a barrio about fifteen miles\naway.\n\nThe invitation of the commanding officer to go on a \"hike\" was eagerly\naccepted, and, in ten minutes after the message was given, the troops\nwere on the march followed by two adventurous pedagogues.\n\nDarkness was just closing in as we left the town, but a resplendent\ntropic moon soon made the night almost as brilliant as the day. The\ntrail we followed led over rough and rocky country. Sometimes for a\ndistance of a mile or more we passed over barren wastes of volcanic\nslag poured out in anger by some peak whose convulsions have long\nsince ceased. Again we would descend into a tropical jungle from the\ndense foliage of which the ladrones could have leaped at any moment,\nhad they known of our coming, and annihilated our little band. We\nforded rapid streams with the water at our breasts, and halted only\nonce in that rapid march of fifteen miles.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the town we met a man who was standing\nguard against a surprise by the ladrones. Nothing could well have been\nmuch more grotesque and nothing could much better illustrate the\nabsolutely primitive condition of the Filipinos in the interior of the\nislands than the appearance of this guard. A pair of knee pants, a\nconical grass hat, and a hemp shirt formed his entire apparel. A long\nflat wooden shield, a bolo, and a long bamboo spear with a sharp,\nflat, iron point, completed his equipment for battle.\n\nHere stood the first and the twentieth centuries side by side. The\nFilipino who had advanced only a stage beyond the condition of\nprimitive man with his knife, spear, and wooden shield, stood side by\nside with the American soldier, a representative of modern life with\nhis magazine rifle, his canteen, his knapsack,--with every article of\nhis clothing made to give him the highest possible efficiency as the\nunit of a military organization.\n\nA few yards farther on we met another guard equipped similarly to the\nfirst. Upon reaching the town, news had just been received that a\ndetachment of troops from another post had intercepted the ladrones\nand fought a skirmish with them. The ladrones had escaped and we set\nout in pursuit of them on a chase wilder than a Quixotic dream. We\nwound our way into the mountains behind the town, inquiring at every\ngrass hut we passed whether the band of ladrones had passed that way,\nbut only once was even a trace of them found. Then it was learned that\nat a certain place they had separated into groups of three or four and\ngone glimmering through the dream of things that were. This place was\nin a secluded nook of the mountains where in years gone by some\nadventurous Spaniard had erected a primitive water mill to grind his\nsugar-cane. We had now marched about twenty miles and the feet of the\npedagogues were a mass of blisters. They had reached the point where\nthat form of military maneuvering called \"hiking\" ceased to possess\nany alluring charms. So a native was persuaded to come out of his lone\nmountain hut and hitch up his carabao and cart. He was then made to\nget on the carabao's back, while the aforesaid pedagogues lay down on\nthe sugar-cane pulp that had been put into the body of the cart, and\nthe driver was instructed to start for the post we had left hours\nbefore, and not to stop until he got there. Being uncertain but that\nsome of the ladrones would learn of our having left the body of troops\nand would try the metal of our steel, we at first agreed that neither\nof us should go to sleep, but it was later decided that probably the\ndriver had no greater desire to cross the Styx than his passengers had\nand that in case of danger he would awaken us, so both took a revolver\nin each hand, stretched out supinely and went to sleep.\n\nSuch a sleep! The rough jolting of the cart over an almost impassable\nroad was never enough to break the spell of slumber. When we awoke the\nblazing tropic sun was past the midday mark of morning, shining full\ninto our unprotected and well-nigh blistered faces.\n\nA pack of dogs were heralding our approach to a little village at the\nfoot of the mountains where ponies were procured to take us back to\nthe post.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he insists, \"have stood the test of ages; and the plant\nevery where retained its name and credit: and one of our good\nherbarists, who had seen a wonderful case of a swoln spleen, so big, and\nhard as to be felt with terror, brought back to a state of nature by it\"\n\n(p. 37). The greatest portion of Hill's concluding section combines\nadvertisement for the powder medicine he was himself manufacturing at a\nhandsome profit together with a protest against competing apothecaries:\n\"An intelligent person was directed to go to the medicinal herb shops in\nthe several markets, and buy some of this Spleen-wort; the name was\nwritten, and shewn to every one; every shop received his money, and\nalmost every one sold a different plant, under the name of this: but\nwhat is very striking, not one of them the right\" (p. 42).\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis did not cease to be printed after Hill's in\n1766, but continued to issue from the presses into the nineteenth\ncentury. A good example of this is the tome by John Reid, physician to\nthe Finsbury Dispensary in London, Essays on Insanity, Hypochondriasis\nand Other Nervous Affections (1816), which summarizes theories of the\nmalady. A bibliographical study of such works would probably reveal\na larger number of titles in the nineteenth century than in the previous\none, but by this time the nature and definition of hypochondria had\nchanged significantly.\n\nIf John Hill's volume is not an important contribution in the history of\nmedicine, it is a lucid and brief exposition of many of the best ideas\nthat had been thought and written on the hyp, with the exception of his\nuninhibited prescribing of herbal medicines as cure-alls. An\nunderstanding of this disease is essential for readers of neoclassical\nEnglish literature, especially when we reflect upon the fact that some\nof the best literature of the period was composed by writers whom it\nafflicted. It is perhaps not without significance that the greatest poet\nof the Augustan age, Alexander Pope, thought it necessary as he lay on\nhis deathbed in May 1744 to exclaim with his last breath, \"I never was\nhippish in my whole life.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. I. - The NATURE of the DISORDER.\n\n\nTo call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and cruel. It\nis a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by thickened\nand distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver, and other\nparts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick scarce knows\none more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\n\nThe blood is a mixture of many fluids, which, in a state of health, are\nso combined, that the whole passes freely through its appointed vessels;\nbut if by the loss of the thinner parts, the rest becomes too gross to\nbe thus carried through, it will stop where the circulation has least\npower; and having thus stopped it will accumulate; heaping by degrees\nobstruction on obstruction.\n\nHealth and chearfulness, and the quiet exercise of mind, depend upon a\nperfect circulation: is it a wonder then, when this becomes impeded the\nbody looses of its health, and the temper of its sprightliness? to be\notherwise would be the miracle; and he inhumanly insults the afflicted,\nwho calls all this a voluntary frowardness. Its slightest state brings\nwith it sickness, anguish and oppression; and innumerable ills follow\nits advancing steps, unless prevented by timely care; till life itself\ngrows burthensome.\n\nThe disease was common in antient Greece; and her physicians understood\nit, better than those perhaps of later times, in any other country; who\nthough happy in many advantages these fathers of the science could not\nhave, yet want the great assistance of frequent watching it in all its\nstages.\n\nThose venerable writers have delivered its nature, and its cure: in the\nfirst every thing now shews they were right; and what they have said as\nto the latter will be found equally true and certain. This, so far as\npresent experience has confirmed it, and no farther, will be here laid\nbefore the afflicted in a few plain words.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. II. - Persons Subject to it.\n\n\nFatigue of mind, and great exertion of its powers often give birth to\nthis disease; and always tend to encrease it. The finer spirits are\nwasted by the labour of the brain: the Philosopher rises from his study\nmore exhausted than the Peasant leaves his drudgery; without the benefit\nthat he has from exercise. Greatness of mind, and steady virtue;\ndetermined resolution, and manly firmness, when put in action, and\nintent upon their object, all also lead to it: perhaps whatever tends to\nthe ennobling of the soul has equal share in bringing on this weakness\nof the body.\n\nFrom this we may learn easily who are the men most subject to it; the\ngrave and studious, those of a sedate temper and enlarged understanding,\nthe learned and wise, the virtuous and the valiant: those whom it were\nthe interest of the world to wish were free from this and every other\nillness; and who perhaps, except for this alloy, would have too large a\nportion of human happiness.\n\nThough these are most, it is not these alone, who are subject to it.\n\nThere are countries where it is endemial, and in other places some have\nthe seeds of it in their constitution; and in some it takes rise from\naccidents. In these last it is the easiest of cure; and in the first\nmost difficult.\n\nBeside the Greeks already named, the Jews of old time were heavily\nafflicted with this disease; and in their descendants to this day it is\noften constitutional: the Spaniards have it almost to a man; and so have\nthe American Indians. Perhaps the character of these several nations may\nbe connected with it. The steady honour, and firm valour of the\nSpaniard, very like that of the ancient Doric nation, who followed the\nflute not the trumpet to the field; and met the enemy, not with shouts\nand fury, but with a determined virtue: it is the temper of the\nHypochondriac to be slow, but unmoveably resolved: the Jew has shewn\nthis mistakenly, but almost miraculously; and the poor Indian, untaught\nas he is, faces all peril with composure, and sings his death-song with\nan unalter'd countenance.\n\nAmong particular persons the most inquiring and contemplative are those\nwho suffer oftenest by this disease; and of all degrees of men I think\nthe clergy. I do not mean the hunting, shooting, drinking clergy, who\nbear the tables of the great; but the retir'd and conscientious; such as\nattend in midnight silence to their duty; and seek in their own cool\nbreasts, or wheresoever else they may be found, new admonitions for an\nage plunged in new vices. To this disease we owe the irreparable loss of\nDr. YOUNG; and the present danger of many other the best and most\nimproved amongst us. May what is here to be proposed assist in their\npreservation!\n\nThe Geometrician or the learned Philosopher of whatever denomination,\nwhose course of study fixes his eye for ever on one object, his mind\nintensely and continually employed upon one thought, should be warned\nalso that he is in danger; or if he find himself already afflicted, he\nshould be told that the same course of life, which brought it on, will,\nwithout due care, encrease it to the most dreaded violence.\n\nThe middle period of life is that in which there is the greatest danger\nof an attack from this disease; and the latter end of autumn, when the\nsummer heats have a little time been over, is the season when in our\nclimate its first assaults are most to be expected. The same time of the\nyear always increases the disorder in those who have been before\nafflicted with it; and it is a truth must be confessed, that from its\nfirst attack the patient grows continually, though slowly, worse; unless\na careful regimen prevent it.\n\nThe constitutions most liable to this obstruction are the lean, and dark\ncomplexioned; the grave and sedentary. Let such watch the first\nsymptoms; and obviate, (as they may with ease) that which it will be\nmuch more difficult to remove.\n\nIt is happy a disease, wherein the patient must do a great deal for\nhimself, falls, for the most part, upon those who have the powers of\nreason strongest. Let them only be aware of this, that the distemper\nnaturally disposes them to inactivity; and reason will have no use\nunless accompanied with resolution to enforce it.\n\nThough the physician can do something toward the cure, much more depends\nupon the patient; and here his constancy of mind will be employed most\nhappily. No one is better qualified to judge on a fair hearing what\ncourse is the most fit; and having made that choice, he must with\npatience wait its good effects. Diseases that come on slowly must have\ntime for curing; an attention to the first appearances of the disorder\nwill be always happiest; because when least established it is easiest\noverthrown: but when that happy period has been neglected, he must wait\nthe effects of such a course as will dilute and melt the obstructing\nmatter gradually; for till that be done it is not only vain, but\nsometimes dangerous, to attempt its expulsion from the body.\n\nThe blood easily separates itself into the grosser and the thinner\nparts: we see this in bleeding; and from the toughness of the red cake\nmay guess how very difficult it will be to dissolve a substance of like\nfirmness in the vessels of the body. That it can thus become thickened\nwithin the body, a Pleurisy shews us too evidently: in that case it is\nbrought on suddenly, and with inflammation; in this other, slowly and\nwithout; and here, even before it forms the obstruction, can bring on\nmany mischiefs. Various causes can produce the same effect, but that in\nall cases operates most durably, which operates most slowly. The watery\npart of the blood is its mild part; in the remaining gross matter of it,\nare acrid salts and burning oils, and these, when destitute of that\nhappy dilution nature gives them in a healthy body, are capable of doing\ngreat mischief to the tender vessels in which they are kept stagnant.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. III. - The SYMPTOMS of the DISORDER.\n\n\nThe first and lightest of the signs that shew this illness are a lowness\nof spirits, and inaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love\nof solitude and a habit of thinking, even on trifling subjects, with too\nmuch steadiness. A very little help may combat these: but if that\nindolence which is indeed a part of the disorder, will neglect them;\nworse must be expected soon to follow.\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness, weight, and oppression in the body,\na want of appetite, or, what is worse, an appetite without digestion;\nfor these are the conditions of different states of the disease, a\nfullness and a difficulty of breathing after meals, a straitness of the\nbreast, pains and flatulencies in the bowels, and an unaptness to\ndischarge their contents.\n\nThe pulse becomes low, weak, and unequal; and there are frequent\npalpitations of the heart, a little dark-coloured urine is voided at\nsome times; and a flood of colourless and insipid at others; relieving\nfor a moment, but increasing the distemper: there is in some cases also\na continual teazing cough, with a choaking stoppage in the throat at\ntimes; then heartburn, sickness, hardness of the belly, and a costive\nhabit, or a tormenting and vain irritation.\n\nThe lips turn pale, the eyes loose their brightness and by degrees the\nwhite grows as it were greenish, the gums want their due firmness, with\ntheir proper colour; and an unpleasing foulness grows upon the teeth:\nthe inside of the mouth is pale and furred, and the throat dry and\nhusky: the colour of the skin is pale (though there are periods when the\nface is florid) and as the obstruction gathers ground, and more affects\nthe liver, the whole body becomes yellow, tawny, greenish, and at length\nof that deep and dusky hue, to which men of swift imagination have given\nthe name of blackness.\n\nThese symptoms do not all appear in any one period of the disease, or in\none case, but at one time or other all of them, as well as those which\nfollow: the flesh becomes cold to the touch, though the patient does not\nhimself perceive it; the limbs grow numbed and torpid, the breathing\ndull and slow, and the voice hollow; and usually the appetite in this\nperiod declines, and comes almost to nothing: night sweats come on,\nblack swellings appear on the veins, the flesh wastes and the breast\nbecomes flat and hollow: the mouth is full of a thin spittle, the head\nis dizzy and confus'd, and sometimes there is an unconquerable numbness\nin the organs of speech.\n\nI have known the temporary silence that follows upon this last symptom\nbecome a jest to the common herd; and the unhappy patient, instead of\ncompassion and assistance, receive the reproof of sullenness, from those\nwho should have known and acted better.\n\nAbout twenty years ago I met on a visit at Catthorpe in Leicestershire a\nyoung gentleman of distinguished learning and abilities, who at certain\ntimes was speechless. The vulgar thought it a pretence: and a jocose\nlady, where he was at tea with company, putting him as she said to a\ntrial, poured out a dish very strong and without sugar. He drank it and\nreturned the cup with a bow of great reserve, and his eye bent on the\nground: she then filled the cup with sugar, and pouring weak tea on it,\nsent it him: he drank that too, looked at her steadily, and blushed for\nher. The lady declared the man was dumb; the rest thought him perverse,\nand obstinate; but a constant and steady perseverance in an easy method\ncured him.\n\nAll these are miseries which the disease, while it retains its natural\nform, can bring upon the patient; and thus he will in time be worn out,\nand led miserably, though slowly, to the grave. Let him not indulge his\ninactivity so far as to give way to this, because it is represented as\nfar off; the disease may suddenly and frightfully change its nature; and\nswifter evils follow.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. IV. - The DANGER.\n\n\nWe have done with the obstruction considered in itself; but this, though\noften unsurmountable by art, at least by the methods now in use, will be\nsometimes broken through at once by nature, or by accidents; and bring\non fatal evils. These are strictly different diseases, and are no\notherway concerned here, than as the consequences of that of which we\nare treating.\n\nThe thick and glutinous blood which has so long stagnated in the spleen,\nwill have in that time altered its nature, and acquired a very great\ndegree of acrimony: while it lies dormant, this does no more mischiefs,\nthan those named already; but when violent exercise, a fit of outrageous\nanger, or any thing else that suddenly shocks and disturbs the frame,\nputs it in motion, it melts at once into a kind of liquid putrefaction.\n\nBeing now thin, it mixes itself readily with the blood again, and brings\non putrid fevers; destroys the substance of the spleen itself, or being\nthrown upon some other of the viscera, corrodes them, and leads on this\nway a swift and miserable death. If it fall upon the liver, its tender\npulpy substance is soon destroyed, jaundices beyond the help of art\nfirst follow, then dropsies and all their train of misery; if on lungs,\nconsumptions; if on the brain, convulsions, epilepsy, palsy, apoplexy;\nif on the surface, leprosy.\n\nThe intention of cure is to melt this coagulation softly, not to break\nit violently; and then to give it a very gentle passage through the\nbowels. There is no safe way for it to take but that; and even that when\nurged too far may bring on fatal dysenteries.\n\nLet none wonder at the sudden devastation which sometimes arises from\nthis long stagnant matter, when liquified too hastily: how long, how\nmany years the impacted matter will continue quiet in a schirrous tumour\nof the breast; but being once put in motion, whether from accident, or\nin the course of nature, what can describe; or what can stop its\nhavock!\n\nInstances of the other are too frequent. A nobleman the other day died\nparalytick: dissection shewed a spleen consumed by an abscess, formed\nfrom the dissolved matter of such an obstruction: and 'tis scarce longer\nsince, a learned gentleman, who had been several years lost to his\nfriends, by the extreams of a Hypochondriacal disorder, seem'd gradually\nwithout assistance to recover: but the lungs suffered while the spleen\nwas freed; and he died very soon of what is called a galloping\nconsumption.\n\nWhen the obstruction is great and of long continuance, if it be thus\nhastily moved, the consequence is, equally, a sudden and a miserable\ndeath, whether, like the matter of a cancer, it remains in its place; or\nlike that of a bad small pox, be thrown upon some other vital part.\n\nLet not the patient be too much alarmed; this is laid down to caution,\nnot to terrify him: it is fit he should know his danger, and attend to\nit; for the prevention is easy; and the cure, even of the most advanced\nstages, when undertaken by gentle means, is not at all impracticable: to\nassist the physician, let him look into himself, and recollect the\nsource of his complaint. This he may judge of from the following\nnotices.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. V. - The Causes of the HYPOCHONDRIASIS.\n\n\nThe obstruction which forms this disease, may take its origin from\ndifferent accidents: a fever ill cured has often caused it; or the\npiles, which had been used to discharge largely, ceasing; a marshy soil,\npoisoned with stagnant water, has given it to some persons; and altho'\nindolence and inactivity are oftenest at the root, yet it has arisen\nfrom too great exercise.\n\nReal grief has often brought it on; and even love, for sometimes that is\nreal. Study and fixed attention of the mind have been accused before;\nand add to these the stooping posture of the body, which most men use,\nthough none should use it, in writing and in reading. This has\ncontributed too much to it; but of all other things night studies are\nthe most destructive. The steady stillness, and dusky habit of all\nnature in those hours, enforce, encourage, and support that settled\ngloom, which rises from fixt thought; and sinks the body to the grave;\neven while it carries up the mind to heaven. He who would have his lamp\n        At midnight hour\n  Be seen in some high lonely tower,\nwill waste the flame of this unheeded life: and while he labours to\nunsphere the spirit of Plato will let loose his own.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VI. - The Cure of the HYPOCHONDRIASIS.\n\n\nLet him who would escape the mischiefs of an obstructed spleen, avoid\nthe things here named: and let him who suffers from the malady,\nendeavour to remember to which of them it has been owing; for half the\nhope depends upon that knowledge.\n\nNature has sometimes made a cure herself, and we should watch her ways;\nfor art never is so right as when it imitates her: sometimes the\npatient's own resolution has set him free. This is always in his power,\nand at all times will do wonders.\n\nThe bleeding of the piles, from nature's single efforts, has at once\ncured a miserable man; where their cessation was the cause of the\ndisorder. A leprosy has appeared upon the skin, and all the symptoms of\nthe former sickness vanished. This among the Jews happened often: both\ndiseases we know were common among them: and I have here seen something\nvery like it: Water-Dock has thrown out scorbutic eruptions, and all the\nformer symptoms of an Hypochondriacal disorder have disappeared:\nreturning indeed when these were unadvisedly struck in; but keeping off\nentirely when they were better treated. A natural purging unsuppressed\nhas sometimes done the same good office: but this is hazardous.\n\nIt is easy to be directed from such instances; only let us take the\nwhole along with us. Bleeding would have answered nature's purpose, if\nshe could not have opened of herself the h\u00e6morrhoidal vessels; but he\nwho should give medicines for that purpose, might destroy his patient by\ntoo great disturbance. If a natural looseness may perform the cure, so\nmay an artificial; when the original source of the disorder points that\nway. But these are helps that take place only in particular cases.\n\nThe general and universal method of cure must be by some mild and gently\nresolving medicine, under the influence of which the obstructing matter\nmay be voided that, or some other way with safety. The best season to\nundertake this is the autumn, but even here there must be caution.\n\nIn the first place, no strong evacuating remedy must be given; for that,\nby carrying off the thinner parts of the juices, will tend to thicken\nthe remainder; and certainly encrease the distemper. No acrid medicine\nmust be directed, for that may act too hastily, dissolve the impacted\nmatter at once, and let it loose, to the destruction of the sufferer; no\nantimonial, no mercurial, no martial preparation must be taken; in\nshort, no chymistry: nature is the shop that heaven has set before us,\nand we must seek our medicine there. The venerable ancients, who knew\nnot this new art, will lead us in the search; and (faithful relators as\nthey are of truth) will tell us whence we may deduce our hope; and what\nwe are to fear.\n\nBut prior to the course of any medicine, and as an essential to any good\nhope from it, the patient must prescribe himself a proper course of\nlife, and a well chosen diet: let us assist him in his choice; and speak\nof this first, as it comes first in order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VI. - Rules of Life for Hypochondriac Persons.\n\n\nAir and exercise, as they are the best preservers of health, and\ngreatest assistants in the cure of all long continued diseases, will\nhave their full effect in this; but there requires some caution in the\nchoice, and management of them. It is common to think the air of high\ngrounds best; but experience near home shews otherwise: the\nHypochondriac patient is always worse at Highgate even than in London.\n\nThe air he breathes should be temperate; not exposed to the utmost\nviolences of heat and cold, and the swift changes from one to the\nother; which are most felt on those high grounds. The side of a hill is\nthe best place for him: and though wet grounds are hurtful; yet let\nthere be the shade of trees, to tempt him often to a walk; and soften by\ntheir exhalation the over dryness of the air.\n\nThe exercise he takes should be frequent; but not violent. Motion\npreserves the firmness of the parts, and elasticity of the vessels; it\nprevents that aggregation of thick humours which he is most to fear. A\nsedentary life always produces weakness, and that mischief always\nfollows: weak eyes are gummy, weak lungs are clogged with phlegm, and\nweak bowels waste themselves in vapid diarrhoeas.\n\nLet him invite himself abroad, and let his friends invite him by every\ninnocent inducement. For me, I should advise above all other things the\nstudy of nature. Let him begin with plants: he will here find a\ncontinual pleasure, and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful\nthings; even of the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to\nwalk; and every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket,\nwill afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually\nin the air, and continually to change the nature and quality of the air,\nby visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the lawn, the\nheath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be abroad; and the\nunceasing variety of the subjects of his observation, will prevent his\nwalking hastily: he will pursue his studies in the air; and that\ncontemplative turn of mind, which in his closet threatened his\ndestruction, will thus become the great means of his recovery.\n\nIf the mind tire upon this, from the repeated use, another of nature's\nkingdoms opens itself at once upon him; the plant he is weary of\nobserving, feeds some insect he may examine; nor is there a stone that\nlies before his foot, but may afford instruction and amusement.\n\nEven what the vulgar call the most abject things will shew a wonderful\nutility; and lead the mind, in pious contemplation higher than the\nstars. The poorest moss that is trampled under foot, has its important\nuses: is it at the bottom of a wood we find it? why there it shelters\nthe fallen seeds; hides them from birds, and covers them from frost;\nand thus becomes the foster father of another forest! creeps it along\nthe surface of a rock? even there its good is infinite! its small roots\nrun into the stone, and the rains make their way after them; the moss\nhaving lived its time dies; it rots and with the mouldered fragments of\nthe stone forms earth; wherein, after a few successions, useful plants\nmay grow, and feed more useful cattle!\n\nIs there a weed more humble in its aspect, more trampled on, or more\ndespised than knot grass! no art can get the better of its growth, no\nlabour can destroy it; 'twere pity if they could, for the thing lives\nwhere nothing would of use to us; and its large and most wonderfully\nabundant seeds, feed in hard winters, half the birds of Heaven.\n\nWhat the weak moss performs upon the rock the loathed toadstool brings\nabout in timber: is an oak dead where man's eye will not find it? this\nfungus roots itself upon the bark, and rots the wood beneath it; hither\nthe beetle creeps for shelter, and for sustenance; him the woodpecker\nfollows as his prey; and while he tears the tree in search of him, he\nscatters it about the ground; which it manures.\n\nNor is it the beetle alone that thus insinuates itself into the\nsubstance of the vegetable tribe: the tender aphide, whom a touch\ndestroys, burrows between the two skins of a leaf, for shelter from his\nwinged enemies; tracing, with more than Dedal\u00e6an art, his various\nmeanders; and veining the green surface with these white lines more\nbeautifully than the best \u00c6gyptian marble.\n\n'Twere endless to proceed; nor is it needful: one object will not fail\nto lead on to another, and every where the goodness of his God will\nshine before him even in what are thought the vilest things; his\ngreatness in the lead of them.\n\nLet him pursue these thoughts, and seek abroad the objects and the\ninstigations to them: but let him in these and all other excursions\navoid equally the dews of early morning, and of evening.\n\nThe more than usual exercise of this prescription will dispose him to\nmore than customary sleep, let him indulge it freely; so far from\nhurting, it will help his cure.\n\nLet him avoid all excesses: drink need scarce be named, for we are\nwriting to men of better and of nobler minds, than can be tempted to\nthat humiliating vice. Those who in this disorder have too great an\nappetite, must not indulge it; much eaten was never well digested: but\nof all excesses the most fatal in this case is that of venery. It is the\nexcess we speak of.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VII. - The proper DIET.\n\n\nIn the first place acids must be avoided carefully; and all things that\nare in a state of fermentation, for they will breed acidity. Provisions\nhardened by salting never should be tasted; much less those cured by\nsmoaking, and by salting. Bacon is indigestible in an Hypochondriac\nstomach; and hams, impregnated as is now the custom, with acid fumes\nfrom the wood fires over which they are hung, have that additional\nmischief.\n\nMilk ought to be a great article in the diet: and even in this there\nshould be choice. The milk of grass-fed cows has its true quality: no\nother. There are a multitude of ways in which this may be made a part\nboth of our foods and drinks, and they should all be used.\n\nThe great and general caution is that the diet be at all times of a kind\nloosening and gently stimulating; light but not acrid. Veal, lamb,\nfowls, lobsters, crabs, craw-fish, fresh water fish and mutton broth,\nwith plenty of boiled vegetables, are always right; and give enough\nvariety.\n\nRaw vegetables are all bad: sour wines, old cheese, and bottled beer are\nthings never to be once tasted. Indeed much wine is wrong, be it of what\nkind soever. It is the first of cordials; and as such I would have it\ntaken in this disease when it is wanted: plainly as a medicine, rather\nthan a part of diet. Malt liquor carefully chosen is certainly the best\ndrink. This must be neither new, nor tending to sourness; perfectly\nclear, and of a moderate strength: it is the native liquor of our\ncountry, and the most healthful.\n\nToo much tea weakens; and even sugar is in this disorder hurtful: but\nhoney may supply its place in most things; and this is not only harmless\nbut medicinal; a very powerful dissolvent of impacted humours, and a\ngreat deobstruent.\n\nWhat wine is drank should be of some of the sweet kinds. Old Hock has\nbeen found on enquiry to yield more than ten times the acid of the sweet\nwines; and in red Port, at least in what we are content to call so,\nthere is an astringent quality, that is most mischievous in these cases:\nit is said there is often alum in it: how pregnant with mischief that\nmust be to persons whose bowels require to be kept open, is most\nevident. Summer fruits perfectly ripe are not only harmless but\nmedicinal; but if eaten unripe they will be very prejudicial. A light\nsupper, which will leave an appetite for a milk breakfast, is always\nright; this will not let the stomach be ravenous for dinner, as it is\napt to be in those who make that their only meal.\n\nOne caution more must be given, and it may seem a strange one: it is\nthat the patient attend regularly to his hours of eating. We have to do\nwith men for the most part whose soul is the great object of their\nregard; but let them not forget they have a body.\n\nThe late Dr. STUKELY has told me, that one day by appointment visiting\nSir ISAAC NEWTON, the servant told him, he was in his study. No one was\npermitted to disturb him there; but as it was near dinner time, the\nvisitor sat down to wait for him. After a time dinner was brought in; a\nboil'd chicken under a cover. An hour pass'd, and Sir ISAAC did not\nappear. The doctor eat the fowl, and covering up the empty dish, bad\nthem dress their master another. Before that was ready, the great man\ncame down; he apologiz'd for his delay, and added, \"give me but leave to\ntake my short dinner, and I shall be at your service; I am fatigued and\nfaint.\" Saying this, he lifted up the cover; and without any emotion,\nturned about to STUKELY with a smile; \"See says he, what we studious\npeople are, I forgot I had din'd.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VIII. - The MEDICINE.\n\n\n'Tis the ill fate of this disease, more than of all others to be\nmisunderstood at first, and thence neglected; till the physician shakes\nhis head at a few first questions. None steals so fatally upon the\nsufferer: its advances are by very slow degrees; but every day it grows\nmore difficult of cure.\n\nThat this obstruction in the spleen is the true malady, the cases\nrelated by the antients, present observation, and the unerring\ntestimonies of dissections leave no room to doubt. Being understood, the\npath is open where to seek a remedy: and our best guides in this, as in\nthe former instance, will be those venerable Greeks; who saw a thousand\nof these cases, where we see one; and with less than half our theory,\ncured twice as many patients.\n\nOne established doctrine holds place in all these writers; that whatever\nby a hasty fermentation dissolves the impacted matter of the\nobstruction, and sends it in that state into the blood, does incredible\nmischief: but that whatever medicine softens it by slow degrees, and, as\nit melts, delivers it to the bowels without disturbance; will cure with\nequal certainty and safety.\n\nFor this good purpose, they knew and tried a multitude of herbs; but in\nthe end they fixed on one: and on their repeated trials of this, they\nbanished all the rest. This stood alone for the cure of the disease; and\nfrom its virtue received the name of SPLEEN-WORT. O wise and happy\nGreeks! authors of knowledge and perpetuators of it! With them the very\nname they gave a plant declared its virtues: with us, a writer calls a\nplant from some friend; that the good gardener who receives the honour,\nmay call another by his name who gave it. We now add the term smooth\nto this herb, to distinguish it from another, called by the same general\nterm, though not much resembling it.\n\nThe virtues of this smooth Spleen-wort have flood the test of ages; and\nthe plant every where retained its name and credit: and one of our good\nherbalists, who had seen a wonderful case of a swoln spleen, so big, and\nhard as to be felt with terror, brought back to a state of nature by it;\nand all the miserable symptoms vanish; thought Spleen-wort not enough\nexpressive of its excellence; but stamp'd on it the name of MILT-WASTE.\n\nIn the Greek Islands now, the use of it is known to every one; and even\nthe lazy monks who take it, are no longer splenetic. In the west of\nEngland, the rocks are stripped of it with diligence; and every old woman\ntells you how charming that leaf is for bookish men: in Russia they use\na plant of this kind in their malt liquor: it came into fashion there\nfor the cure of this disease; which from its constant use is scarce\nknown any longer; and they suppose 'tis added to their liquor for a\nflavour.\n\nThe ancients held it in a kind of veneration; and used what has been\ncalled a superstition in the gathering it. It was to be taken up with a\nsharp knife, without violence, and laid upon the clean linen: no time\nbut the still darkness of the night was proper, and even the moon was\nnot to shine upon it. I know they have been ridiculed for this; for\nnothing is so vain as learned ignorance: but let me be permitted once to\nvindicate them.\n\nThe plant has leaves that can close in their sides; and their under part\nis covered thick with a yellow powder, consisting of the seeds, and seed\nvessels: in these they knew the virtue most resided: this was the golden\ndust they held so valuable; and this they knew they could not be too\ncautious to preserve. They were not ignorant of the sleep of plants; a\nmatter lately spoken of by some, as if a new discovery; and being\nsensible that light, a dry air, an expanded leaf, and a tempestuous\nseason, were the means of losing this fine dust; and knowing also that\ndarkness alone brought on that closing of the leaf which thence has\nbeen called sleep; and which helped to defend and to secure it, they\ntherefore took such time, and used such means as could best preserve the\nplant entire; and even save what might be scattered from it.--And now\nwhere is their superstition?\n\nFrom this plant thus collected they prepared a medicine, which in a\ncourse of forty days scarce ever failed to make a perfect cure.\n\nWe have the plant wild with us; and till the fashion of rough chemical\npreparations took off our attention from these gentler remedies, it was\nin frequent use and great repute. I trust it will be so again: and many\nthank me for restoring it to notice.\n\nSpleen-wort gives out its virtues freely in a tincture; and a small dose\nof this, mixing readily with the blood and juices, gradually dissolves\nthe obstruction; and by a little at a time delivers its contents to be\nthrown off without pain, from the bowels. Let this be done while the\nviscera are yet sound and the cure is perfect. More than the forty days\nof the Greek method is scarce ever required; much oftener two thirds of\nthat time suffice; and every day, from the first dose of it, the patient\nfeels the happy change that is growing in his constitution. His food no\nmore turns putrid on his stomach, but yields its healthful nourishment.\n\nThe swelling after meals therefore vanishes; and with that goes the\nlowness, and anxiety, the difficult breath, and the distracting cholick:\nhe can bear the approach of rainy weather without pain; he finds himself\nmore apt for motion, and ready to take that exercise which is to be\nassistant in his cure; life seems no longer burthensome. His bowels get\ninto the natural condition of health, and perform their office once at\nleast a day; better if a little more: the dull and dead colour of his\nskin goes off, his lips grow red again, and every sign of health\nreturns.\n\nLet him who takes the medicine, say whether any thing here be\nexaggerated. Let him, if he pleases to give himself the trouble, talk\nover with me, or write to me, this gradual decrease of his complaints,\nas he proceeds in his cure. My uncertain state of health does not\npermit me to practise physic in the usual way, but I am very desirous to\ndo what good I can, and shall never refuse my advice, such as it may be,\nto any person rich or poor, in whatever manner he may apply for it. I\nshall refer him to no apothecary, whose bills require he should be\ndrenched with potions; but tell him, in this as in all other cases,\nwhere to find some simple herb; which he may if he please prepare\nhimself; or if he had rather spare that trouble, may have it so prepared\nfrom me.\n\nWith regard to Spleen-wort, no method of using it is more effectual than\nsimply taking it in powder; the only advantage of a tincture, is that a\nproper dose may be given, and yet the stomach not be loaded with so\nlarge a quantity: it is an easier and pleasanter method, and nothing\nmore.\n\nIf any person choose to take it in the other way, I should still wish\nhim once at least to apply to me; that he may be assured what he is\nabout to take is the right plant. Abuses in medicines are at this time\nvery great, and in no instance worse than what relates to herbs. The\nbest of our physicians have complained upon this head with warmth, but\nwithout redress: they know the virtues and the value of many of our\nnative plants, but dread to prescribe them; lest some wrong thing should\nbe administered in their place; perhaps inefficacious, perhaps\nmischievous, nay it may be fatal. The few simple things I direct are\nalways before me; and it will at all times be a pleasure to me, in this\nand any other instance, to see whether what any person is about to take\nbe right. I have great obligations to the public, and this is the best\nreturn that I know how to make.\n\nTo see the need of such a caution, hear a transaction but of yesterday!\n\nAn intelligent person was directed to go to the medicinal herb shops in\nthe several markets, and buy some of this Spleen-wort; the name was\nwritten, and shewn to every one; every shop received his money, and\nalmost every one sold a different plant, under the name of this: but\nwhat is very striking, not one of them the right. Such is the chance of\nhealth in those hands through which the best means of it usually pass;\neven in the most regular course of application.\n\nI would not be understood to limit the little services I may this way be\nable to render the afflicted, to this single instance; much less to\npropose to myself any advantages from it. Whoever pleases will be\nwelcome to me, upon any such occasion; and whatever be the herb on which\nhe places a dependance, he shall be shewn it growing. I once recommended\na garden to be established for this use, at the public expence: one\ngreat person has put it in my power to answer all its purposes.\n\n                        F  I  N  I  S.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris, he was\n\"nominated\" to the Academy. He had but to present an Historical\nPainting in order to take his seat as an Academician.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VENUS AND MARRIAGE\n\n\nBack in his beloved Paris again; thrilled by the atmosphere and gaiety\nof its merry life; in the full vigour of manhood on the eve of his\nthirties; amongst congenial friends; done with the drudgery of winning\nto Academic honour, Boucher saw that the public were not falling over\neach other to purchase religious or historic pictures; he straightway\nturned his back upon these things, and on the edge of his thirtieth\nyear he gave to the world his \"Marriage of the Children of God with\nthe Children of Men,\" in which Venus is the avowed mistress of his\nadoration. It caused a fine stir, and greatly increased his repute.\n\nIn this picture he ends his Italian period and strikes his own\npersonal note. Both this and the \"Venus asking arms for Aeneas from\nVulcan,\" together with the \"Birth of Adonis\" and the \"Death of\nAdonis,\" of about the same period, still show Boucher strongly under\nthe influence of his master, Lemoyne. Indeed, the \"Birth\" and \"Death\nof Adonis,\" their record lost during the scuffle and confusion of the\nRevolution, for long hung side by side as pictures by Lemoyne, until,\nbeing cleaned about 1860, Boucher's initials were discovered upon\nthem, and, contemporary engravings being hunted up, still further\nproved their origin. But in the Venus that now figures in all his\nworks there is that flesh-painting of the nude, and that rosy touch\nupon the flesh of the female figure, that are a far more certain\nsignature of Boucher's handiwork than any written name.\n\nUnfortunately the Salons were closed during Boucher's earlier years\nuntil he was thirty-four, and the record of his work during these\nyears is difficult to follow; but with his service to Venus his\npersonal career begins, and the stream of his Venus-pieces steadily\nflows from his hands.\n\nHe came to her service rid of all prentice essays in craftsmanship, a\nfinished and consummate artist. He found in his subject a goddess to\nwhom he could devote his great and splendid gifts. He painted her\ndainty body with a radiant delight and a rare colour-sense such as\nFrance had never before seen or uttered. He remains to this day the\nfirst painter of the subtle, delicate, and elusive thing that is\nfemininity; he caught her allure, her charm, as he was to catch the\nfragrance and charm of children and flowers; and he set the statement\nof these things upon canvas as they have never been uttered.\n\nThe whole of his life long, Boucher gave himself up with equal and\npassionate devotion to work and to pleasure--working at his easel\noften twelve hours of his day without losing, to the end when the\nbrush fell from his dead fingers, his blitheness of heart or his\ngenerosity of act, and without weakening the pleasure-loving desires\nof his gadding spirit. Out of his splendid toil he made the means to\nindulge his tastes for pleasure; and the gratifying of his tastes in\nturn renewed and created the ideas that made the subjects of his\nartistry. He brought to all he did a joy in the doing that made of his\nvast labour one long pleasure--of his pleasures a riot of industry. He\nplayed as he toiled, scarce knowing which was play and which toil.\n\nThe gossip of his love-affairs makes no romantic story--they were but\ncommonplace ecstasies with unknown frail women. But hard as he worked\nand lived and played, he found time to get himself married in his\nthirtieth year to pretty seventeen-year-old Marie Jeanne Buseau, a\nlittle Parisian--and for love of her, so far as he understood the\nbusiness; for she brought him no dowry.\n\nThe young couple settled down for the next ten years in the Rue\nSaint-Thomas-du-Louvre. Here Boucher lived through his thirties.\n\nMadame was a pretty creature, if we had but Latour's pastel portrait\nalone to prove it. But the pretty features were the crown to as pretty\na body, for she sat often to her lord; and it is clear from his\ncorrespondence with a friend, Bachaumont, that she is the Psyche of\nhis illustrated fable--and Psyche runs much to the Altogether.\n\nMarriage, however, was not likely to imprison Boucher's gadding eyes;\nand it did not. Madame Boucher seems to have had as frail a heart, and\navoided strife by amusing herself, amongst others, with the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who, to gain access to the lady,\ncommissioned Boucher to do the Watteau-like illustrations to\nAcajou--a dull affair. Boucher's pretty wife, herself no mean\nartist, worked in his studio, and painted several smaller canvases\nafter his pictures, gaining some fame as a miniaturist and engraver.\n\nNor did Marriage turn Boucher from his art. Two years were gone by\nsince his nomination to the Academy; he had now to paint the formal\nHistorical Picture and present it in order to take his seat as\nAcademician; and it was in this his thirtieth year that he painted and\nwon his academic rank with the \"Renauld et Armide\" now at the Louvre.\n\nHere he sufficiently subordinated his own style to the academic to\nensure success; and the work was hailed by Academicians and critics,\nincluding Diderot, with enthusiasm. But even here we have his cupids\npeeping round the mythologic event; and Armide herself has pretty\nFrench lips that knew no Greek.\n\nOnce secure of his position, he straightway flung the last remnants of\nthe academic style out of his studio door; and it is a grim comment on\ncriticism that it was just exactly in proportion as he developed his\nown personal genius and uttered the France of his day, that he was\nattacked; whilst the stilted things that he knew were third-rate, and\nwhich he wholly rejected from henceforth, were exactly the things that\nwere praised!\n\nHis election to the Academy, and the enthusiasm over the picture that\nwon him his seat thereat, brought his name before the young king; the\nfollowing year he received his first order from the Court whose\npainter he was destined to become. The decorations in the queen's\napartments were gloomy and had grown black; and he painted in their\nstead the \"Charity,\" \"Abundance,\" \"Fidelity,\" and \"Prudence\" still\nthere to be seen. Indeed, with his gay vision, his pretty habit of\nculling only the flowers from the garden of life, and his quickness to\nset down the pleasing thing in every prospect, Boucher was the\ndestined painter of a Court weary of pomposity and the pose of the\nmock-heroic, and which was wholly giving itself up to pleasure and the\nelegances.\n\nBut neither his new dignity of Academician nor the royal favour, kept\nhim from the bookshops; and he illustrated, with rare beauty and a\ncharm worthy of Watteau, the great edition of the Works of Moli\u00e8re\nin his thirty-first year. It is true that he made as free with\nMoli\u00e8re's world as with the Gods of Olympus; he peoples the plays with\ncharacters of his own day, arrayed in the dress and habit of that day,\nand moving in surroundings that he saw about him.\n\n\nLE MONDE QUI S'AMUSE\n\n\nThe Homely had come upon the town out of Holland, painted with most\nconsummate artistry by Chardin, and was soon in the vogue. Boucher had\na quick eye for the mode. And he straightway set himself to the\npainting of \"La Belle Cuisini\u00e8re.\" Still-life and homely subjects need\nan accuracy of realism and a Dutch sense of these things, a sense of\nsincerity and an appreciation of the dignity of the work-a-day life of\nthe people, in which Boucher was wholly lacking. Above all, it calls\nfor a sense of \"character,\" which, in Boucher, was always weak. It was\na sneer against him that his very broomsticks called for pompons and\nribbons--and there was more than a little truth in the spite. He is\nmore concerned with the accident of the kissing of a kitchen-maid than\nwith the kitchen's habit. He cannot even peep into a scullery without\ndragging in Venus by the skirts, and tricking her out in a\nproperty-wardrobe of a scullery-wench, in which the girl is clearly\nbut acting the part.\n\nHowever, these passing vogues and experiments in different methods\nwere only gay asides--he was working the while upon his own subjects;\nand, to the display by its several members ordered by the Academy, he\nsent four little paintings of fauns and cupids which won him the\nhonour of election as deputy-professor. His brain and hand were very\nbusy, and he turns from one thing to another with amazing facility,\nbringing distinction to all that he does.\n\nBut he painted about this time two pictures of infants, \"L'Amour\nOiseleur\" and \"L'Amour Moissonneur,\" which were the beginning of that\nhost of cupids that he let fly from his studio; they frolic across his\ncanvases and join the retinue of Venus, peeping out from clouds, over\nwaves, round curtains, painted with a perfection that has never been\nsurpassed in the portrayal of infants. He painted their round limbs,\ntheir lusty life, their delightful awkwardnesses, their jolly fat\ngrace, their na\u00efve surprise at life and glory in it, as they had never\nbeen painted before, and have never been painted since.\n\nHe also gave forth in this his thirty-third year a \"Pastoral\" and a\n\"Shepherd and Shepherdess in Conversation,\" with sheep about them and\nin a pleasant landscape, which were his first essays in the style that\nhe created and which made him famous.\n\nHis friend Meissonnier, the inventor of the rococo, stood godfather to\nBoucher's first-born son in the May of 1736.\n\nFrom the very beginning Boucher seems to have been engraved. And these\nengravings, done by the best gravers of his day, greatly extended his\nreputation and popularised him; he fully realised the value of the\nadvertisement as well as his profits from it. Before his thirty-third\nyear was run out he published his well-known \"Cries of Paris.\"\n\nBoucher's description of them, \"studies from the low classes,\" holds\nthe key to that something of failure to realise the dramatic verities\nthat is over all; it gives also the attitude of the France that he\nknew towards the France that he did not, and could not understand. He\ncreated that dainty, pleasant atmosphere that comes floating up to the\nwindows on a fresh morning in Paris from the musical cries of\nthe street vendors; but of the deeper significance of the\nstreet-sellers--of the miserable accent in their life, of their weary\ntoil, of the dignity of their labour--he knew nothing; his brush could\nnot refrain from making elegance and fine manners peep from behind the\nstreet-porter's fustian or the milkmaid's skirt.\n\nBut his thirty-third year was to contain a more far-reaching\nsignificance even than the creation of his cupid-pieces and pastorals.\n\nThe \"Cries of Paris\" were scarce printed when Boucher's illustration\nto \"Don Quixote\" appeared--\"Sancho pursued by the servants of the\nDuke.\" This design was to have far-reaching results that Boucher\nlittle suspected.\n\nThe painter Oudry had been called to the conduct of the great tapestry\nlooms at Beauvais a couple of years before; and in his efforts to\nfurnish the looms with good designs, he now called Boucher to his aid,\nwhose original and fresh style, colour, and arrangement, together with\nhis personal vision, and the enthusiasm and zeal with which he threw\nhimself into the work, at once increased the reputation and the\nproducts of the famous looms. This large designing for the tapestries\nwas, in return, of immense value to the development of the genius of\nthe man, enlarging his breadth of style and giving scope to that great\ndecorative sense that was his superb gift. Thenceforth he was destined\nto play a supreme part in the history of the world-famed factories. He\nnow produced painting after painting for the Beauvais looms.\n\nLife is now one long triumph for Boucher, only disturbed in this year\nby the sad news of the suicide of his old master, Lemoyne. It was in\nthis, Boucher's thirty-fourth year, that the Salon was opened for the\nfirst time since Boucher's infancy, and he contributed several\ncanvases to it.\n\nRigaud, the old Academician, now close upon eighty, straggling through\nthe great galleries, might well blink and gasp at the change that had\ncome over French art since he last exhibited there, thirty-three years\ngone by; but his scoffs and regrets held no terrors for the younger\nAcademicians gathered about. He stood in a new world. A new generation\nwas in possession. The grand manner, the severe etiquette, formal\nmock-heroics, and solemn pomposity of Louis the Fourteenth were\nvanished, and the Agreeable and the Pleasant Make-Believe of Louis the\nFifteenth reigned in their stead. Old Rigaud might blink indeed! Just\nas the imposing and stilted etiquette of the reception-room had given\nplace to the easy manners and airy etiquette of the dainty boudoir, so\nhad light chatter and gay wit and the quick repartee usurped the heavy\nsplendours of a consequential age. France, weary of an eternal pose of\nthe grand manner, was seeking change in joyousness and amusement.\n\nGallantry and gaiety were become the object of the ambition of a\ndandified and elegant day. France became a coquette; dressed herself\nas a porcelain shepherdess; and with beribboned crook and sheep,\nseeking pleasant prospects to stroll through, gave herself to\ndalliance--her powder-puff and patch-box and fan a serious part of her\nunseriousness.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE CH\u00c2TEAUROUX\n\n\nAt thirty-five Boucher has arrived. He is in the vogue; in favour at\nCourt--as well as in the fashion. In his three years from taking his\nseat at the Academy to the opening of the first Salon he has created a\nnew and original style--his cupid pieces, his pastorals, his\nVenus-pieces, his tapestry. Boucher's kingdom lay in the realm of the\ndecorative painter--and he has found it. Torn from the surroundings\nfor which he designed them, as part and parcel of the general scheme,\nhis pictures are as out of place as an Italian altarpiece in an\nEnglish dining-room, yet they suffer less. Several may still be seen,\nas he set them up in frames of his own planning, as overdoors in the\npalace of the Soubise, now given up to the national archives.\n\nThe ghost of the Prince of Soubise, who commissioned them, may haunt\nhis palace, but his kin know the place no longer. The overdoors\nwrought by Boucher's skill look down now on the nation's collection of\nhistoric documents. The \"Three Graces enchaining Love,\" the fine\npastoral of \"The Cage,\" and the pastoral of the \"Shepherd placing a\nRose in his Shepherdess's Hair,\" were to see a mightier change than\nthe usurpation of Louis the Fourteenth's pompous age by the elegant\nyears of Louis the Fifteenth. But this was not as yet. Here at least\nwe see Boucher's art rid of all outside influences, and at the full\ntide of creation; here we have the inimitable lightness of touch, the\nfigures and landscape bathed in the airy volume of atmosphere.\n\nHe seems at this time to have played with pastel, due probably to his\nfriendship with Latour, who sent a portrait of Boucher's wife to this\nSalon. Boucher showed in the use of chalks the artistry and skill that\nwere always at his command.\n\nHe also was putting to its full use his innate sense of landscape,\nraising to high achievement that astonishing balance of landscape and\nfigures in his design--a balance that has never been surpassed; his\nfigures never override his landscape; his landscape never overpowers\nhis figures. His earnest counsels to his pupils and his constant\ndeploring of the lack of the landscape art in France prove the great\nstress he laid upon it.\n\nThe designing of a frontispiece for the catalogue of a personal\nfriend, one Gersaint, a merchant of oriental wares, started Boucher in\nhis thirty-third year upon that series of Chinese pictures and\ntapestries known as the \"Chinoiseries,\" in which he frittered away\nonly too many precious hours, for they were received with great favour\nby the public. The paintings of Chinese subjects designed for the\nlooms of Beauvais are still to be seen at Besan\u00e7on.\n\nBut busy as were his brain and hand in the exercise of his wide and\nversatile gifts, pouring out \"Chinoiseries,\" illustrations for books,\ntapestries on a large scale, landscapes, models for the gilt bronze\ndecorations of porcelain vases, scheming handsome frames for his\npictures, designing furniture and fans--Boucher was true, above all,\n\"to his goddess,\" and painted the famed \"Birth of Venus,\" which,\nthanks to the Swedish Ambassador's fondness for Madame Boucher, now\nhangs at Stockholm; our amorous Count de Tessin, to be just, seems to\nhave had a rare flair for the artistic--besides artist's wives. It was\non the 15th of April in 1742, the last year of his thirties, that the\nRoyal favour was marked by the grant of a pension of 400 livres\n(double florins) to Boucher with promise of early benefits to follow.\n\nTwo years afterwards it was raised to 600 livres.\n\nThis was the year that he painted the beautiful canvas of \"Diana\nleaving the Bath with one of her Companions,\" now at the Louvre. It\nwas also the year that saw his landscape, the \"Hamlet of Iss\u00e9\" at the\nSalon. This \"Hameau d'Iss\u00e9\" was to be enlarged for the Opera, proving\nhim to be decorator there, where he was arranging waterfalls,\ncascades, and the rest of the pretty business, without staying his\nhand from his art.\n\nAt forty Boucher has come into his kingdom. The ten years of these\nforties were to be a vast triumph for him. He was to produce\nmasterpiece after masterpiece. His art had caught the taste of the\nday. He was at the height of his powers. He had done great things--he\nwas to do greater. During these ten years of his forties he poured\nforth vivid and glowing works of sustained power and originality.\n\nWe have a picture of him as he was in the flesh at this time--the\npastel portrait by Lundberg, now at the Louvre--a gay, somewhat\ndissipated, handsomely dressed dandy of the time, smiling out of his\ncareless day, the debonnair man of fashion, the laughing eyes showing\nsigns of the night carousals, which were the rest from the prodigious\ntoil of this vital and forthright spirit.\n\nIt was in this our artist's fortieth year that the gifted old Cardinal\nFleury, who had guided the fortunes of France with rare skill, died,\nbroken by his ninety years and the blunders of the disastrous war that\nhe had so strenuously opposed; and Louis, essaying the strut of\nkingship, became king by act. His indolent character, unequal to the\nmighty business, his indeterminate will fretted by the set of\nquarrelling and intriguing rogues that he gathered about him as his\nministers, he fell into the habit that became his thenceforth, the\nonly thing to which he paid the tribute of constancy--he ruled France\nfrom behind pretty petticoats. He had early shown the adulterous blood\nof his great-grandfather; two, if not three, of five sisters of the\nnoble and historic house of De Nesle had yielded to his gadding fancy;\nthe youngest now ousted her sister De Mailly from the king's favour,\nwas publicly acknowledged as the king's mistress, and became Duchess\nof Ch\u00e2teauroux. Boucher painted her handsome being as a shepherdess in\none of his pastorals. She was no ordinary toy of a king. A woman of\ntalent, with hot ambitions for the king's majesty, fired with the\npride of race of the old French noblesse, it was during her short\nyears of ascendancy over the king that he roused from his body's\ntorpor and made an effort to reach the dignity and eminence befitting\nto the lord of a great and gallant people. He stepped forth awhile\nfrom his drunken bouts and manifold mean adulteries, and set himself\nat the head of the army in Flanders, and strutted it as conqueror.\n\nPoor Ch\u00e2teauroux only got the hate of the people for reward, Louis the\nhonours; for the people resented the public dishonour of her state.\n\nPower she found to be a dead-sea apple in her pretty mouth. The glory\nof it all, the splendours, were not the easily won delights for which\nshe had looked. She had to fight a duel, that never ended, with the\nking's witty, crafty, and scurrilous Prime Minister, the notorious\nMaurepas--and Maurepas willed that no woman should ever come between\nhim and the king--Maurepas who knew no mercy, no decency, no chivalry,\nno scruple. At Ch\u00e2teauroux's urging, Louis placed himself at the\nhead of the army; and France went near mad with joy that she had\nagain found a king. Crafty Maurepas urged on the business; the\nCh\u00e2teauroux suddenly realised his cunning glee--it separated her from\nthe king.\n\nOut of the whirl of things Boucher's fortune was ripening, little as\nhe might suspect it.\n\nHe was painting masterpieces that make his name live. To his fortieth\nyear belong the famed \"Birth of Venus,\" the \"Venus leaving the Bath,\"\nthe \"Muse Clio,\" the \"Muse Melpomene,\" and the three well-known\npastorals now at the Louvre--\"The Sleeping Shepherdess,\" the \"Nest,\"\n\n\nand the \"Shepherd and Shepherdesses.\" Of the many famous Venus-pieces\nthat his hand painted during these years it is not easy to write the\nlist. But having signed the \"Marriage of Love and Psyche\" at\nforty-one, he turned his experimental hand to the homely, realistic\nDutch style that was having a wide vogue, and painted the\n\"Dejeuner\"--a family of the prosperous class of the day at\nbreakfast--showing with rare charm the surroundings and home life of\nthe well-to-do of his time.\n\nAll goes well with Boucher. He changes into better quarters in the Rue\nde Grenelle-Saint-Honor\u00e9, where he lived for the next five years,\nuntil 1749; but his eyes are fixed upon a studio and apartments at\nthe old palace of the Louvre, though the hard intriguing of his\npowerful friends at Court on his behalf failed for some time. He had,\nindeed, to make another move before he arrived at his longed-for goal.\n\nPensions Boucher, like others, had found to be somewhat empty affairs;\nbut rooms at the Louvre were a solid possession eagerly sought after\nby the artists.\n\nIn this year of 1744 Boucher created a new fashion at the annual Salon\nby sending studies and sketches instead of finished pictures; and it\nset a value upon such things not before realised by artists, for\nsuccess was instant and loud.\n\nTowards the end of the next, Boucher's forty-second year, the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who was to take his leave of Paris,\ncommissioned four pictures to represent the day of a woman of fashion,\nand to be entitled \"Morning,\" \"Midday,\" \"Evening,\" and \"Night.\"\n\nBoucher painted one of these for him, now known as the \"Marchande de\nModes.\" The others were painted later, and all had a wide vogue as\nengravings. The correspondence has interest since it reveals Boucher's\nbusiness habits; he was paid for a picture on its delivery, and for\neach of these he was to receive 600 livres (double florins or\ndollars)--about a hundred and twenty pounds.\n\nIn an official document of the Director of Buildings to the king (or\nMinister of Fine Art, as we should say), written in this year of 1745,\nBoucher being forty-two, is a \"list of the best painters,\" in which\nBoucher is singled out for distinction as \"an historic painter, living\nin the Rue de Grenelle-Saint-Honor\u00e9, opposite the Rue des Deux-Ecus,\npupil of Lemoyne, excelling also in landscape, grotesques, and\nornaments in the manner of Watteau; and equally skilled in painting\nflowers, fruit, architecture, and subjects of gallantry and of\nfashion.\"\n\nNot so bad for dry officialdom; the critics could learn a lesson. For\nhe was nothing less. What indeed does he not do? and wondrous well!\nthis painter of the age.\n\nAnd the mighty rush of events is about to sweep him into further\nprominence; the very things which he probably passed by with a gay\nshrug are to enrich him, to help him to his highest fulfilment.\n\nPoor Ch\u00e2teauroux saw that she must lose the king's gadding favour in\nthe conflict with Maurepas unless she joined her lord, now with the\narmy. She realised full well that she had created the new Louis of\nAmbition--that her going must bring the people's hate to her. But she\ndared not lose the king. And she went. Maurepas had overdone his\njibings. The indiscretion at once rang through the land; became the\njest of the army--and Maurepas was not far from the bottom of the\nbusiness. The discreet indiscretion of covered ways between the king's\nlodgings and hers only added to the mockeries, and increased the\npeople's hate against, of course, the Ch\u00e2teauroux. Then upon a day in\nAugust the small-pox seized Louis at Metz; poor Ch\u00e2teauroux fought for\npossession of the king in the sick room, until his fear of\ndeath--Louis' sole piety--sent her packing--shrinking back in the\nhired carriage at each halting-place for change of horses, lest she\nshould be seen and torn from her place and destroyed by the populace.\n\nBut Louis recovered; Paris rang with bells at joy on his recovery, and\nhe entered the city amidst mad enthusiasm, hailed as The Well-Beloved.\n\nHe sent for the Ch\u00e2teauroux to find her dying, Maurepas having to\ndeliver the message of recall. She died suddenly and in great agony,\nswearing that Maurepas had poisoned her--died in the arms of her poor\ndiscarded sister, the De Mailly.\n\nBut this year of 1745 Boucher hears a mightier scandal that is to mean\nvast things to all France--and not least of all to Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE POMPADOUR\n\n\nA young bride had become the gossip of the rich merchant society of\nParis--that class that was ousting the old noblesse from power. She\nwas a beautiful, a remarkable woman; her wit was repeated in the\ndrawing-rooms, she had all the accomplishments; her charming\nname--Madame Lenormant d'Etioles.\n\nDraw aside the curtains of the past and we discover our little Jeanne\nPoisson--grown into this exquisite creature. It has come about in\nstrange fashion enough. The father--a scandalous fellow--having\nfingered the commissariat moneys in ugly ways to his own use, had been\nbanished for the ugly business. Nor is Jeanne's mother any better than\nshe should be; and the wags wink knowingly at the handsome and rich\nman of fashion, Monsieur Lenormant de Tournehem, who has been the\nfavoured gallant during the absence of the light-fingered Poisson.\n\nAnd, of a truth, Lenormant de Tournehem takes astonishing interest in\nthe little Jeanne--watching over her up-growing and giving her the\nbest of education at the convent, where she wins all hearts, and is\nknown as \"the little queen.\" The truth spoken with wondrous prophecy,\nif unthinkingly, as we shall see. Complacent Poisson came home, and\ntook the rich and fashionable, bland and smiling Lenormant de\nTournehem to his arms. Has he not wealth and estates? therefore as\nexcellent a friend for Poisson as for Madame Poisson. The girl Jeanne\nleaves the convent to be taught the accomplishments by the supreme\nmasters of France, the wits foregather at Madame Poisson's, and the\nbrilliant Jeanne is soon mistress of the arts--coquetry not least of\nall; has also the most exquisite taste in dress. Under all is a heart\ncold as steel; calculating as the higher mathematics. She has but one\nhindrance to ambition--her mean birth. Lenormant de Tournehem rids her\neven of this slur by making his nephew, Lenormant d'Etioles, marry\nher, giving the young couple half his fortune for dowry, and the\npromise of the rest when he dies--also he grants him a splendid\ntown-house, as splendid a country seat. And consequential\nself-respecting little Lenormant d'Etioles is lord of Etioles, amongst\nother seignories. So Jane Fish appears as Madame Lenormant d'Etioles,\nseductive, beautiful, accomplished, to whose house repair the new\nphilosophy, the wits, and artists. She has a certain sense of virtue;\nindeed openly vows that no one but the king shall ever come between\nher and her lord. But, deep in her heart, she has harboured a fierce\nambition--that the king shall help her to keep her bond. She puts\nforth all her gifts, all her powers, to win to the strange goal;\nconfides it to her worldly mother and \"uncle,\" Lenormant de Tournehem;\nfinds keen allies therein to the reaching of that strange goal. The\ndeath of the Ch\u00e2teauroux clears the way. At a masked ball the king is\nintrigued as to the personality of a beautiful woman who plagues him\nwith her art; he orders the unmasking. Madame Lenormant d'Etioles\nstands revealed, drops her handkerchief as by accident; the whisper\nruns through the Court that \"the handkerchief has been thrown!\" The\nking stoops and picks it up. A few evenings later she is smuggled into\nthe \"private apartments.\" She goes again a month later; in the morning\nis seized with sudden terror--she daren't go back to her angry lord\nlest he do her grievous harm; he will have missed her. The king is\ntouched; allows her to hide from henceforth in the secret apartments;\npromises the beautiful creature a lodging, her husband's banishment,\nand early acknowledgment as titular mistress--before the whole Court\nat Easter, says the pious Great One. But he has to join the army to\nplay the Conqueror at Fontenoy; and it is later in the year\n(September) before Madame d'Etioles is presented to the Court in a\nvast company and proceeds to the queen's apartments to kiss hands on\nappointment. Thus was Jeanne Poisson raised to the great aristocracy\nof France in her twenty-third year as Marquise de Pompadour.\n\nBoucher had been one of the brilliant group of artists of the\nd'Etioles' circle. That the Pompadour's influence had much effect upon\nhis position at Court for a year or two is unlikely; for she had to\nfight for possession of the king day and night, as the Ch\u00e2teauroux\nhad done, against the queen's party and the unscrupulous enmity of\nMaurepas. To set down Boucher's favour at Court to her is ridiculous.\n\nHe was painting for the queen's apartments at thirty-one when the\nPompadour was a school-girl of twelve. But in the year following her\nrise to power, Boucher painted four pictures for the large room of the\nDauphin, which were \"placed elsewhere\"; and, the year after that, he\nwas at work upon two pictures for the bedroom of the king at the\ncastle of Marly. It is likely enough that the Pompadour directed this\norder. She had almost immediately secured the office of the\nDirector-General of Buildings, which covered the direction of the\nroyal art treasures, for \"uncle\" Lenormant de Tournehem, who was also\na friend of the artist. And from this year it is significant that\nBoucher paints no more for the opposing camp of the Queen and Dauphin.\n\nHe was now giving all his strength to the \"Rape of Europa\" that he\npainted for the competition ordered by the Academy at the command of\nLenormant de Tournehem in the king's name, in which ten chosen\nAcademicians were to paint subjects in their own style for six prizes\nand a gold medal, to be awarded in secret vote by the competing\nartists themselves. Boucher won, by his amiable nature, the good-will\nof them all by proposing that they should so arrange as to share the\nprizes equally, and thus prevent any sense of soreness inevitable in\nthe losers.\n\nBut greatly as he won the good-fellowship of his fellow-artists by it,\nthis picture caused a murmur to rise amongst the critics who,\naforetime loud in his praise, now began to complain of his \"abuse of\nrose tints\" in the painting of the female nude. The fact was that\nDiderot and the men of the New Philosophy were turning their eyes to\nthe whole foundations upon which France was built, art as well as\nsociety, and were beginning to demand of art \"grandeur and morality in\nits subjects.\" They were soon to be clamouring for \"the statement of a\ngreat maxim, a lesson for the spectator.\" Diderot, with bull-like\ncourage, picked out the greatest, and turned upon Boucher, blaming him\nfor triviality.\n\nThe nations, weary of war, concluded the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in\nthe October of 1748. No sooner was peace concluded than Louis\nrelapsed into his old habit of dandified indolence and profligate\nease; and, putting from him his duties as the lord of a great people,\nhe gave himself up to shameless intrigues. He allowed the Pompadour to\nusurp his magnificence and to rule over the land. He yielded himself\nutterly, if sometimes sulkily, to her domination; and for sixteen\nyears she was the most powerful person at Court, the greatest force in\nthe state--making and unmaking ministers, disposing of office,\nhonours, titles, pensions. All political affairs were discussed and\narranged under her guidance; ministers, ambassadors, generals\ntransacted their business in her stately boudoirs; the whole patronage\nof the sovereign was dispensed by her pretty hands; the prizes of the\nChurch, of the army, of the magistracy could be obtained solely\nthrough her favour and good-will. Her energy must have been\nprodigious. Possessed of extraordinary talents and exquisite tastes,\nshe gave full rein to them, and it was in the indulgence of her better\nqualities that Destiny brought Boucher into the friendship of this\nwonderful woman. She became not only his patron but his pupil,\nengraving several of his designs.\n\nBut this, her sovereignty over the king, easy and light in its outward\nseeming, was a haggard nightmare to the calculating woman who had so\nlonged for it. She knew no single hour's rest from the night she won\nto the king's bed. She had to fight her enemies, secret and open, for\npossession of the king's will, day and night; and she fought--with\nrare courage. She won by consummate skill and unending pluck. She made\nherself an essential part of the king's freedom from care. The Court\nparty fought her for power with constant vigilance. Maurepas brought\nall his unscrupulous art, all his ironic mimicry, all his vile jibes\nand unchivalrous hatred to bear against her. He had made himself a\nnecessity to the king; and he never slept away a chance of injuring\nher. He knew no mercy, no nobility, no pity. He made her the detested\nobject of the people. With his own hands he penned the witty verses\nand epigrams that were sung and flung about the streets of Paris.\n\nBut she had an enemy more subtle than any at the Court--hour by hour\nshe had to dispute the king with the king's boredom. And it was in the\neffort to do so that she created her celebrated theatre in the\nprivate apartments, calling Boucher and others to her aid in the doing\nof it. Here the noblest of France vied with each other to obtain the\nsmallest part to play, an instrument in its orchestra, an invitation\nto its performances.\n\nBoucher left the Opera to become its decorator in 1748, and did not\nreturn until her death. For her, he also decorated her beautiful rooms\nat Bellevue. She bought at high prices many of his greatest\nmasterpieces.\n\nThe Pompadour's power so greatly increased that she openly took\ncommand of the king's will; dared and succeeded in getting his\nfavourite Maurepas banished; and herself took to the use of the kingly\n\"we.\" Her rascally father was created Lord of Marigny; her brother,\nwhom the king liked well and called \"little brother,\" was created\nMarquis de Vandi\u00e8res; her only child, Alexandrine, signed her name as\na princess of the blood royal, and would have been married to the\nblood royal had she not caught the small-pox and died. She amassed a\nprivate fortune, castles, and estates such as no mistress had dreamed\nof; and into them she poured art treasures that cost the nation\nthirty-six millions of money. She created the porcelain factory of\nS\u00e8vres, kept keen watch over the Gobelins looms, and founded the great\nMilitary School of St. Cyr amidst work that would have kept several\nstatesmen busy, and of deadly intrigues at Court that would have\nbroken the spirit of many a brilliant man.\n\nIt was in her hectic desire to keep the king from being bored that she\nstooped, and made Boucher stoop, to the employment of his high\nartistry in the painting of a series of indecent pictures wherewith to\ntickle the jaded desires of Boredom, and thereby gave rise to the\nwidespread impression that Boucher's art was ever infected by base\ndesign. But Boucher was, at his very worst, but a healthy animal; and\neven in these secret works for the king he did not reach so low as did\nmany an artist of more pious memory who painted with no excuse but his\nown pleasure.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the Pompadour has been blamed too much for this\nevil act, and too much forgotten for her splendid patronage of the man\nwho, under it and during these great years of his forties, produced a\nseries of masterpieces that place him in the foremost rank of the\npainters of his century. It is impossible to reckon the number of the\npastorals and Venus-pieces that his master-hand painted and loved to\npaint, during these the supreme years of his genius. It is significant\nthat they were painted during the years that saw the Pompadour in\nsupreme power.\n\nBoucher was so firmly established in 1750, his forty-seventh year,\nthat he moved into a new house in the Rue Richelieu, near the Palais\nRoyal. Disappointed in not receiving a studio and apartments at the\nLouvre, he was allowed to use a studio in the king's library. He was\nnow making money so easily that he was able to collect pictures and\nprecious stones and the gaily coloured curiosities that appealed to\nhis tastes.\n\nThe critics were becoming more and more censorious; and one of them\nhits true with the comment that in his pastorals his shepherdesses\nlook as if they had stepped over from the Opera and would soon be off\nagain thereto.\n\nIn his forty-eighth year Boucher's art was at its most luminous\nstage--his atmosphere clear and subtle and exquisitely rendered; his\nyellows golden; his whites satin-like and silvery; his flesh-tones\nupon the nude bodies of his goddesses unsurpassed by previous art. The\nbeauty of it all was not to last much longer.\n\nLenormant de Tournehem died suddenly in the November of 1751; the\nPompadour's brother, Abel Poisson de Vandi\u00e8res, was appointed\nDirector-General in his stead at the age of twenty-five--and soon\nafterwards, on the death of his father, created Marquis de Marigny--a\nshy, handsome youth, a gentleman and an honourable fellow, whom the\nking liked well, and against whom his sister's sole complaint was that\nhe lacked the brazen effrontery of the courtiers of the day. No man\ndid more for the advancement of the art of his time. A pension of a\nthousand livres falling vacant, the young fellow secured it for\nBoucher; and almost immediately afterwards, a studio becoming vacant\nat the Louvre owing to the death of Coypel, first painter to the king,\nBoucher came to his coveted home, eagerly moving in with his family as\nsoon as its wretched state could be put into repair.\n\nThe decoration of the new wing to the palace at Fontainebleau brought\nthe commission for the painting of the ceiling and the principal\npicture in the Council Chamber to Boucher, who had already decorated\nthe Dining-Room. This was the period of his painting the \"Rising\" and\nthe \"Setting of the Sun\" for the Pompadour, now in the Watteau\ncollection, two canvases that were always favourites with the painter,\nbitterly as they were assailed by the critic Grimm.\n\nHe was turning out so much work that it was impossible to give as much\ncare to his pictures as he ought. For he refused sternly, his life\nlong, to raise his prices; by consequence he had to create a larger\namount of work in order to meet his expenditure. It was about this\ntime that Reynolds, passing through Paris, went to visit him and found\nhim painting on a huge canvas without models or sketches. \"On\nexpressing my surprise,\" writes Reynolds, \"he replied that he had\nconsidered the model as necessary during his youth until he had\ncompleted his study of art, but that he had not used one for a long\ntime past.\"\n\nHe soon had not the time, not only to paint from nature but even to\ngive his pictures the work necessary to complete them. The feverish\nhaste which took possession of him in his frantic endeavour to meet\nthe vast demand for his pictures, and the eager efforts of his\nengravers to satisfy the public call for engravings after his works,\ngave him less and less leisure to joy in their doing. And his eyesight\nbegan to fail. His flesh-tints deepened to a reddish hue; and he\nstands baffled before his work, suspecting his sight, since what every\none cries out upon as being bright vermilion, he only sees as a dull\nearthy colour. Boucher has topped the height of his achievement; he\nhas to \"descend the other side of the hill.\" Boucher begins to grow\nold.\n\nIn Boucher's fifty-first year an ugly intrigue of the queen's party at\nCourt to sap the Pompadour's influence over the king by drawing away\nthe king's affections towards Madame de Choiseul-Romanet, a reckless\nyoung beauty of the Court, brought about a strange alliance. The Count\nde Stainville, one of the Pompadour's bitterest enemies, was shown the\nking's letter of invitation to his young kinswoman; and he, deeply\nwounded in his pride that his kinswoman should have been offered to\nthe king, went to the Pompadour and exposed the plot. A close\nalliance followed; and De Stainville thenceforth became her chief\nguide in affairs of state. It was at her instance that the king called\nhim to be his Prime Minister, raising him to the Duchy of Choiseul--a\nname he made illustrious as one of the greatest Ministers of France.\n\nIn his fifty-second year Boucher was appointed to the directorship of\nthe Gobelins looms, to the huge delight of the weavers and all\nconcerned with the tapestry factory. This was the year of his painting\nthe famous portrait of the Pompadour, to whom he several times paid\nthis \"tribute of immorality.\" For the Gobelins looms he produced many\nhandsome designs; and he was painting with astounding industry. But\nhis hand's skill began to falter. His art shows weariness in his\nsixtieth year, and sickness fell upon him, and held him in servitude\nnow with rare moments of respite. The critics, notoriously Diderot,\nwere now attacking him with shameless virulence. Boucher passed it all\nby; but he felt the change that was taking place in the public taste.\n\nThe ideas of the New Philosophy were infecting public opinion; the Man\nof Feeling had arisen in the land; and France, humiliated in war, and\nresenting the follies and the greed of her shameless privileged class,\nwas openly resenting it and all its works. Choiseul had planted his\nstrength deep in the people's party, and was come near to being its\ngod. His masterly mind had checked Frederick of Prussia to the North;\nand the nations, exhausted by the struggle, signed the Peace of Paris\nin 1763. Choiseul, with France at peace abroad, turned to the blotting\nout of the turbulent order of the Jesuits at home. Their attempt to\nend the Pompadour's relations with the king made this powerful woman\neager to complete his design; the chance was soon to come, and the\nOrder was abolished from France and its vast property seized by the\nstate.\n\nThe Pompadour lived but a short while to enjoy her triumph. Worn out\nby her superhuman activities, assailed by debt, she fell ill of a\nracking cough, dying on the 15th of April, 1764, in her forty-second\nyear, keeping her ascendancy over the king and the supreme power in\nFrance to her last hour. Death found her transacting affairs of state.\n\nLouis, weary of his servitude, had only a heartless epigram to cast\nat the body of the dead woman as she passed to her last resting-place.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE END\n\n\nThe death of the Pompadour robbed Boucher of a friend; but her\nbrother, Marigny, remained faithfully attached to the old artist, and\nseized every chance to honour him. On the death of Carle van Loo,\nBoucher, at sixty-two, was made first painter to the king, with all\nhis pensions and privileges that were consistent with this the supreme\nappointment in the art world.\n\nThere had been serious intention of making Boucher the head of the\nEcole des El\u00e8ves Proteg\u00e9s; he had the art of making himself liked and\nof inspiring the love of the arts. He was very popular with the\nstudents and artists, owing to his kindliness, his eagerness to render\nservice, his readiness to encourage the youngsters or to console them.\n\nWhen the riot took place, provoked by the Academicians by their award\nof the Prix de Rome in 1767, the students insulted the Academicians,\nbut hailed Boucher with enthusiastic applause. The reason was not far\nto seek. When a student came to the old master for advice he did not\n\"play the pontiff,\" and, scorning the false dignity of big phrases, he\ntook the brush in his hand and showed the way out of all difficulties\nby simplehearted example, despising rules, and putting himself out in\norder to make things clear to a young artist.\n\nHowever, the Academicians feared he would be an unorthodox master for\nyouth, and appointed another in his place.\n\nA long and serious illness thwarted his keen energies. Diderot was\ngiving himself up to outrageous violence against him. If the old\npainter exhibited at the Salon, Diderot fiercely assailed his art; if\nhe did not exhibit, Diderot as bitterly assailed him for his\nnegligences. Above all, he attacked Boucher in that he did not paint\nwhat Diderot would have painted--but could not. \"When he paints\ninfants,\" cries Diderot, \"you will not find one employed in a real act\nof life--studying his lesson, reading, writing, stripping hemp.\"\n\nPoor unfortunate infants! for whom Philosophy could find no happier\njoy in life than stripping hemp! Boucher was but an artist. He\npainted his generation as far as he could see it, and, with all his\nfaults and weaknesses, he never debauched his art with foreign and\nalien things that had no part in the nation's life; he painted fair\nFrance into his landscapes, not a make-believe land he did not know\nwith preposterous Greek ruins; and best of all, to his eternal honour,\nhe painted infants glad in their gladness to be alive, with no desire\nto send their happy little bodies to school, with no sickly ambition\nto make them into budding philosophers, with no thought of making them\npose and lie as Men of Feeling. He had no joy in setting their little\nbodies to toil--in making them \"teach a lesson to the spectator,\" in\nmaking them stoop their little shoulders to the \"picking of hemp.\"\n\nHe continued to paint as he had always painted--except that he painted\nless well. The wreath of roses was wilting on a grey head. The blood\njigged less warmly in the frail body. The features showed pallid--the\neyes haggard. The sight failed. The hand alone kept something of its\ncunning.\n\nHe went to Holland with his friend Randon du Boisset, but health\nshrank farther from him. Diderot had near spent his last jibe.\n\nIn 1768, Boucher's sixty-fifth year, the neglected queen went to her\ngrave. The king's grief and contrition and vows to amend his life came\ntoo late, and lasted little longer than the drying of the floods of\ntears over the body of his dead consort. A year later he was become\nthe creature of a pretty woman of the gutters, whom he caused to be\nmarried to the Count du Barry--the infamously famous Madame du Barry.\n\nBut neither the remonstrances of Choiseul with the king against this\nfurther degradation of the throne of France, nor his unconcealed scorn\nof the upstart countess, nor the dangerous enemy he made for himself\nthereby, signified now to Boucher, first painter to the king.\n\nBoucher was failing. His son was a prig and a disappointment. His two\nfavourite pupils, Baudoin and Deshayes, who had married his two girls,\ndied.\n\nTo the Salon of 1769 he sent his \"Caravan of Bohemians.\" It was his\nlast display. He had been going about for some time like a gaunt ghost\nof his former self, afflicted with all the ills inevitable to a life\nfeverishly consumed in work and the pursuit of pleasure.\n\nThey went to his studio at five of the clock one May morning, and\nfound him seated at his easel, before a canvas of Venus, dead, with\nthe paint-filled brush fallen out of his fingers.\n\nSo passed he away on the 30th of May 1770, in his sixty-seventh year.\n\nWhen Boucher died, the generation of which he was the limner was near\ncome to its violent end. The rosy carnivals and gay gallantries of his\nage gave way to the blood-stained romance and fierce tempest of the\nRevolution. The garrets of the old curiosity-shops received the\ndiscarded canvases of the master. His shepherds and shepherdesses were\nput to rout by the Romans of his pupil, citizen David. The old order\nwas brought into contempt and overthrown. And with it, Boucher's art,\nlike much that was gracious and charming and good in the evil thing,\nwent down also, and was overwhelmed for a while.\n\nFor a while only. For just as, out of the blood and terror of the\nRevolution, a real France arose, phnix-wise, from the ruin, and in\nbeing born, whilst putting off the vilenesses of the thing from which\nshe sprang, took on also to herself the gracious and winsome qualities\nthat place her amongst the most fascinating peoples of the ages; so\nBoucher has come into his kingdom again--the most gracious of painters\nthat the years have yielded."

                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n        a. One bed, or folding cot,\n        b. One oil stove,\n        c. One lamp,\n        d. Enough supplies of all kinds sufficient for six months,\n        e. Pots, pans, kettles, etc.\nIt is needless to say that positions in Manila and Iloilo were now at\na premium.\n\nWas it possible that teachers were to be sent to places where even the\nnecessaries of life could not be obtained! Was it possible that many\nwould be sent to places so remote that for six months no fresh\nsupplies could be gotten! A mass meeting was held at once, and a\ncommittee was appointed to send a cablegram to the Associated Press\npetitioning aid from the American people at large. Realizing what\nconsternation would be created throughout the United States by such a\nmessage, two of the teachers leaped into a carriage at the close of\nthe meeting and a few moments later were closeted with the chief\nexecutive of the department. As a result the committee was persuaded\nnot to send the cablegram to the Associated Press until by courtesy it\nhad been sent to the President. Of course, this diplomatic move tided\naffairs over and the teachers who had flatly refused to budge from\nManila now agreed to go on to their stations, being assured that\nwhatever action was best would be taken.\n\nThe day had come when we must separate. We were to enter an untried\nand an unknown field. It was fitting that we have a final joyous\nmeeting, so the best orchestra in the archipelago was engaged and we\n\"chased the hours with flying feet\" until dawn so that whatever might\ncome to us in that unknown future upon which we were entering each\nwould hold in pleasant memory our last evening together.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER III. - A DRAMA IN ACTUAL LIFE.\n\n\nAlmost every one heeded the warning to go to his station forearmed\nwith at least necessaries of life, but, as it had never fallen to the\nlot of the writer to cook, he refused to learn at that late day, so he\ntook no pot, no pan, no kettle, putting his future into the hands of\nan uncertain fate and relying upon the unknown hospitality of the\nFilipino.\n\nBacalod, the capital of the province of Occidental Negros, was our\ndestination. The second morning after leaving Manila, we awoke with\nthe \"Kilpatrick\" lying at anchor in a shallow bay. We were several\nmiles from the shore and nothing in sight indicated that we had\nreached a place of any importance. Late the night before we had been\nawakened by the loud, sharp ringing of the ship's bells, accompanied\nby the reversal of the engines and a general disturbance awaking the\ncrew. So our first impressions on coming on deck were that we had run\naground. But the captain assured us that everything was ship-shape and\nthat this was the nearest point of approach to Capiz, a town of\nconsiderable importance on the island of Panay, where a body of troops\nwas to embark for home. Not even the grass hut of a native was in\nsight. Search as we would, not a sign was seen of a stream flowing\ninto the sea, indicating the probable presence of a town. There was\nnot a sign of life of any kind save one lone column of thin, blue\nsmoke that arose from the side of a mountain miles away. One would\nhave thought that we were explorers of three hundred years ago lying\noff the shore of some unknown land.\n\nAfter breakfast the steam launch, together with all the boats, was\nlowered, and several of us who had determined to miss no opportunity\nto gather information about the islands took our places in the launch\nby the side of the ship's mate, and steamed away across the water with\na long line of boats strung out in the rear. We headed away toward a\ngroup of cocoanut trees, and about an hour later stepped ashore on a\npile of decayed coral rocks that extended some twenty or thirty feet\nout into the water, thus forming the only landing place of a town of\nseveral thousands of people and of considerable commercial importance.\n\nA few moments after we had landed, an army wagon drawn by a\nmagnificent pair of mules came up out of a tropical jungle along a\nnarrow road. We clambered into the wagon and were soon lost in the\ndepths of foliage from which we had just seen the vehicle emerge.\n\nLong waving bamboos with their plumy leafage hung over the road from\neach side, meeting and overlapping in the center until they formed an\narchway so dense that the tropical sun now high in the heavens\npenetrated it only at intervals. At times the wagon sank up to the\nhubs in the soft earth, and the muscles of the mules stood out like\nwhip-cords under the skin as they drew us forward.\n\nAt a sharp turn in the road we came upon the first division of troops\nthat was to embark for home. The look of joy upon their sun-browned\nfaces was inexpressible. Their work was done, and with elastic step\nand smiling faces they saluted us as they passed by. The reign of\nforce was at an end; it was going out with them; the reign of peace\nhad begun; it was coming in with us.\n\nIn the afternoon when we returned from the town the last of the troops\nhad arrived and, as we drove up, the bugle was sounding the call to\nsupper. We noticed native women mingling with the troops and, indeed,\na native woman was in constant attention waiting upon one of the\nsoldiers with whom we ate. Her clothes were clean, her hair was nicely\ncombed, and her general appearance was neat. She seemed to anticipate\nthe slightest wish of the soldier with whom she was. She brought him\nwater to drink, cleaned his plate after the meal and saw that his\nknife, fork, and spoon were put into his haversack.\n\nWe had now finished supper and the launch had returned for the last\nload of troops. The lieutenant in command of the company gave the\norder to \"fall in\"; the men shouldered their rifles and fell into\nline. \"Forward, march!\" called the lieutenant, and the column swept\nforward towards the boats. The women had until now restrained\nthemselves, but, as their husbands marched away never to return, their\nfeelings could no longer be restrained. One young woman of about\neighteen, who was leaning against a rock by the roadside sobbing, when\nher husband passed, leaped up in frenzy of passionate love and caught\nthe rifle from his shoulder. Her first impulse seemed to be to throw\nthe gun away, but suddenly realizing the futility of such an act she\nburst into tears, shouldered the rifle herself and marched on by his\nside. Another woman of more mature age threw her arms around the legs\nof a tall stalwart man, and drew him bodily from the line.\n\nBut the troops marched on and entered the boats. One woman who had\nbeen unnoticed before came down into the shallow water and caught hold\nof our last boat as if to prevent its leaving, while others stood\nmingling their sobs with the sounds of the wavelets as they broke on\nthe sands. As we passed away, an expectant mother, standing in bold\noutline against the twilight sky, threw up her hands in an agony of\ndespair and then sank upon the stones. The curtain had fallen upon a\ndrama in actual life deeper in pathos than any other we had ever seen\nor ever expected to see. Depth of passion, depth of love! Who can\nfathom the human heart?\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. - WHAT THE TEACHERS DID.\n\n\nThere is a remarkable sameness about the towns in the Philippines.\n\nThey all have a large open square about the middle of the town, around\nthree sides of which are Chinese stores, unless one side lies open to\nthe sea, and on the fourth is the great stone ecclesia. The streets\nrun at right angles to one another and divide up the town into\ncreditable squares.\n\nEverybody in the Philippines lives up-stairs, for the ground is so\nsoaked with water during the rainy season that it is a menace to\nhealth to live upon the ground floor. So even the poorest nippa hut\nis built upon stakes four or five feet above the ground.\n\nBacalod is a typical Philippine town. As we landed, a broad open\nsquare was spread out before us. Two sides of the square were lined\nwith two-story houses in which were Chinese stores below and Filipino\nhomes above. On the third side stood the great stone church in whose\nmassive tower the clock was striking the hour of four, while the\nfourth lay open to the sea that had borne us thither.\n\nWe landed, but it was in a method new to us and one not usually\nemployed by the traveling public.\n\nWhen our sail boat ran aground on the sandy bottom a hundred yards or\nmore from the shore, a crowd of Filipino men who were on the beach\nslowly rolled up their pantaloons and waded out to the rescue,--for\nthe money that was in it. The boat's crew elevated their trousers'\nlegs also and slided down into the water. Each of us then straddled\nthe neck of a Filipino standing in the water and was held by ankles to\nbe steadied while our biped mounts proceeded to the shore.\n\nWe were now on the ground and face to face with the situation. To give\nthe reader an idea of the actual conditions met by the first teachers\nwho went to the Islands, the following is copied from the instructions\ngiven us in Manila:\n    1. There shall be two sessions daily of all schools, and the\n    last hour of the morning session shall be devoted solely to\n    instructing the Filipino teachers.\n\n    2. In cases where teachers are sent to a town in which there\n    is no school-house, they are expected to secure the aid of the\n    people and have one built.\n\n    3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is\n    stopped.\n\n    4. All supplies must be kept under lock and key. In towns\n    where there is no case or box to lock the supplies in, and it\n    is also impossible to get the town council to furnish a case,\n    a requisition may be sent to Manila, and, if an appropriation\n    can be secured, one will be made and sent out.\n\nThus it can be easily seen that we were indeed pioneers. In many\nplaces no school-house was to be found, and in some cases it was even\ndifficult to get the town council to provide a case in which to keep\nthe supplies.\n\nThe work of the teachers was, in short; to \"make the English language\nthe basis of instruction in the public schools.\" On our arrival at\nBacalod two schools were found in progress, for some soldiers had been\ndetailed for the work here previous to our coming. One of these was\nfor boys and the other, for girls. Thus the work here had been in a\nmeasure simplified, but complications that had arisen at Talisay, one\nof the largest and richest towns on the island, demanded a change of\nteachers and the writer was assigned to the place as superintendent.\n\nHere an attempt had been made to start a school but it had failed\nignominiously and a system of education was to be put into operation\nfrom the very start.\n\nThe Filipinos are not strong advocates of co-education, so separate\nschools were to be started for the boys and the girls. The one for the\nboys was gotten well in hand before the one for the girls was\nattempted at all.\n\nA few days after reaching the town and securing a home the\npresidente of the town had it publicly announced that the following\nMonday morning at eight o'clock a public school for boys would be\nopened in a building that had been rented for the purpose by the\nmunicipal council. About the middle of the afternoon of the same day a\nman beat a little drum throughout all the streets of the town to call\nthe people out and the town clerk announced both in Spanish and in the\nnative language that this public school would begin at the time and\nplace mentioned above; that instruction would be free to all who came;\nthat the government would furnish all supplies; and that instruction\nwould be given in the English language. A native principal and\nassistants were employed and everything was ready to begin.\n\nThe official report of the result is as follows:\n    Boys' public school of Talisay, Negros, P. I., began November\n    4, 1901. Forty-three boys present at eight o'clock. Forty-one\n    of them knew \"good morning\" and \"good afternoon\" but do not\n    know the distinction between them. Two of them speak simple\n    Spanish. At eight forty-five, eight more, who had been\n    attending an early morning private school, came in together.\n\n    The books they brought were so varied and so different from\n    one another that it seemed impossible to bring any reasonable\n    degree of order out of such a chaos, and so, after struggling\n    vainly for about a week with the problem, the superintendent\n    by one fell stroke removed everything in use and put in a\n    uniform system, and from that day on the English language has\n    been the basis of instruction in the public schools of\n    Talisay. The work was of necessity very slow at first, but by\n    the end of a year two schools were going nicely and a number\n    of the brightest boys and girls had made really excellent\n    progress.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER V. - A \"BAILE.\"\n\n\nNot long after the arrival of our party at Bacalod we received an\ninvitation to a \"baile\" given in our honor by the inhabitants of\nSilay, a town some ten or twelve miles up the northern coast and one\nnoted for its social life. The invitation was accepted with pleasure,\nand about the middle of the afternoon on the day appointed we were\nclad in the immaculate white of the tropics and steaming away up the\ncoast on board a launch sent for our conveyance. Twilight was still\nlingering on the path of day when we anchored just off shore at the\ntown. A row-boat containing the officials of the city came out to meet\nus and, in due season, we were ushered into a spacious drawing-room\nfilled almost to overflowing with the \u00e9lite of the town. The \u00e9lite of\ntowns in the Philippines speak Spanish, and, as only one or two of our\nparty could at that time boast of more than a formal acquaintance with\nthe Castilian tongue, the exchange of ideas that evening between us\nand the Filipinos was of necessity not very rapid.\n\nThe necessity of easy communication between us was rendered somewhat\nless indispensable by the announcement of supper as soon as we were\nrested from our trip. When we had taken our places at the table a\nyoung Filipino about twenty-five years of age arose and gave a lengthy\ntoast to the recent union of the Philippines with the United States.\n\nBut as we Americans were unable to scale the dizzy heights of his\nclimaxes or sink to the depths of his pathos, we forewent the\npleasures of his oratory and turned our attention to the savory odor\nof lamb, chicken, and roast pig that came slyly stealing up our\nnostrils to send us nerve dispatches about the gastronomic delights of\nour not far distant future.\n\nAt last the toast was ended and the world-wide soup ushered in a long\ntrain of things good to eat, served in a style better fitted to the\ndelights of the appetite than to the formalities of dinners, for, as\nsoon as the pleasant task of one dish was completed by any one, the\nnext was served him at once regardless of the progress made by the\nothers at the table.\n\nThe last course was dulce. The new-comers to the Philippines will\nnot be long in making the acquaintance of this dish, and at all\nmeetings, both public and private, where eatables are served, it\nperforms an important part. It is anything sweet, and it may vary all\nthe way from an india-rubber-like black mixture of cocoanut milk and\ndirty sugar to a really toothsome and respectable confection. No\nmatter of what materials a dish is composed, just so long as it is\nsweet, it is dulce.\n\nAfter paying our respects to this last course, we arose from the table\nand entered a great rectangular room from the center of whose ceiling\nhung a large glass chandelier, a mass of shimmering crystals. In the\nchairs around the room were the wealth, the youth, and the beauty of\nthe town.\n\nThe first and also the last number of every Filipino dance of any\nformality is the \"rigodon.\" The dancers are arranged in a square, or\nquadrangle according to the number participating, and are then led\nthrough a tangled maze of figures that so utterly bewilders the novice\nthat he sinks into his chair at the end of the dance wondering how it\nall came to pass.\n\nWe Americans breathed a sigh of relief when the \"rigodon\" ended, and\nmustered fresh courage for social conquests in the waltz that was now\nbreathing forth from the trembling strings. My companion in the first\ndance had been the young lady by whose side I had sat at dinner. But\nit now became necessary to search for another, so I prudently waited\nto see how partners were chosen, and made no mistake when a few\nmoments later I faced one of the most luscious looking se\u00f1oritas on\nthe opposite side of the room and offered her my arm. My eyes must\nhave told the story that my lips could not utter in Spanish, for she\nsmiled upon me sweetly, arose, and put her hand upon my shoulder. My\narm encircled her waist and I began to waltz. Unfortunately my\ncompanion did not follow, but began to hop up and down in a manner\nmost distressing. Supposing the attack to be only temporary, I paused\nand, much to my relief, she soon showed signs of recovery; and in the\ncourse of time she came to a standstill looking up into my face in an\ninquiring sort of way, apparently wondering why St. Vitus had not paid\nhis respects to me also. A second attempt to follow the music met with\nresults similar to the first, and during the third attempt, which\nseemed to be trembling on the verge of a failure, St. Vitus let go my\ncompanion and seized me with such vigor that she, who was small even\nfor a Filipino, was gathered up bodily and taken around the room at\nsuch a pace that her toes touched the floor only at far distant\nintervals.\n\nAt this point my devotion to the shrine of Terpsichore ceased from\nforce of circumstances and I seated myself in one of the most\ncomfortable chairs in sight that I might carry out a previously formed\nplan to study the Filipino somewhat critically as he appears in\nsociety.\n\nThe first thing that impressed me as the dancers passed up and down\nthe room was the flash of diamonds. Nearly every woman in the room had\non a brooch that flashed the colors of the rainbow at every turn.\n\nAlmost all of them wore one or more rings that showed up brilliantly\nunder the chandelier. Many of the men too, especially the young men,\nwore gems that appeared to be exquisite. A closer inspection showed\nthat some of the gems had flaws and others were of a poor color, but\nno one would have denied that, taken as a whole, it was a really\nbeautiful display.\n\nThe dress of the ladies was richly colored. Many of their skirts were\nof silk covered with hand embroidered flowers, and their filmy pina\nwaists and broad collar pieces were rich with needle-work. They all\nwore a kind of heelless velvet slipper, very common as a dress shoe in\nthe Philippines, or high-heeled patent leather shoes with neatly\nfitting black stockings.\n\nThe men were dressed in white coats and white pantaloons or black\ncoats and white pantaloons. White shirts and collars, together with\nall sorts and styles of cravats and low-cut patent leather shoes with\nhighly colored socks completed their dress.\n\nIt was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money;\nthat they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a\ntable loaded with good things was a fact to which all of us were\nenthusiastic witnesses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VI. - A SKETCH OF LIFE IN THE PHILIPPINES.\n\n\nHouse-keeping in the Philippines presents some interesting phases. Our\nclub of American officials decided to run a mess, so we employed a\ncook and a house boy, then each of us provided himself with a personal\nservant, making a total of six servants for four men--it takes about\nthis proportion of servants to live in any sort of comfort in the\nPhilippines--and launched ourselves boldly upon the sea of domestic\neconomy. But there were shoals ahead of us, for the question of\nregulating servants is one of no small importance in the Philippines,\nand one of its most disadvantageous features is the long chain of\ndependents that usually attends it.\n\nWe gave the cooks so much a day with which to buy supplies in the\nlocal market, for our own table, making him render a daily list of\nexpenditures, and a fixed amount besides to purchase rice and fish for\nhimself and the other servants. Of course, if they wished to vary\ntheir diet and get chicken and fresh pork, which could be had at far\ndistant intervals, it was wholly a matter of their option, but the\nallowance was made on the basis of so much rice and fish a day for\neach. This allowance was about fifteen cents a day in Spanish coin per\nservant.\n\nThus far all was well. We had agreed to give the cook eight dollars a\nmonth in Spanish money, thinking that good wages would procure good\nservice, but the visions of affluence that floated before him on such\nfloods of wealth were so alluring that they drew him from the kitchen\nto the cooler veranda. In less than a week he had employed an\nassistant at four dollars a month; in less than another week that\nassistant had employed him an assistant at two dollars a month; in\nless than another week that assistant to the assistant had employed\nhim an assistant at the princely salary of fifty cents a month; and\nfrom fear that the chain of dependents would end only by our having\nthe whole Filipino race attached to our culinary force, we broke up\nhouse-keeping and went boarding again, choosing that as the less of\nthe two evils.\n\nOur house furnishings were almost wholly Philippine. The table ware\nand the food on the table came from the ends of the earth. The knives\nand forks were made in Germany, the plates were manufactured in\nEngland, the glass ware and table cloth, in the United States. The\noatmeal and flour came from the United States also. The butter came\nfrom Australia, the rice from China, the salt from Russia, and the\nother eatables from sources about as various as their separate names.\n\nSwitzerland furnished the condensed milk and Illinois the canned\ncream. Nearly all of the canned fruit bore labels from Spain.\n\nThus it can easily be seen that life in the Philippines, if lived\naccording to American ideals, is dependent upon a highly developed and\nhighly complex commerce. However, the difficulties of transportation\nand the restriction of large stocks of merchandise to Manila and some\nhalf a dozen other towns, make so great a difference between country\nlife and city life that a short comparison of the two will not be out\nof place, and life in Manila may well be taken as being fairly typical\nof the latter.\n\nLife in Manila is pleasant, but expensive. It is pleasant from the\nfact that it is not only the capital but also metropolis of the\narchipelago. Thus the combination of wealth and high official position\nhas given to Manila a society of the highest and most refined type.\n\nThe process of beautifying and improving the city which is constantly\ngoing on bids fair to give us at no distant day a city of which we may\nwell be proud.\n\nBut let him who intends living well in Manila on a small income bid\nfarewell at once to so idylic a dream, for it costs much to live well\nthere. In the city of Manila one can get almost anything he wishes,\nbut it must be paid for at the price it commands. Especially in the\ncase of eatables, this price is by no means small, because to the\nfirst cost of articles must in most cases be added the expense of\ndistant shipment from American, European, or Australian ports, and not\ninfrequently the cost of long refrigeration must also be taken into\nconsideration. But, expensive though it is, it is very pleasant to\nlive there and those who have once enjoyed it often wish again to\nquaff the cup of its delights.\n\nIn strong contrast to this pleasant life is the life of the quiet\nlittle hamlet away in the distant islands. Indeed, the Filipino from\nthe distant town, who by some good fortune has been to Manila, or, by\na coup de main, has studied in one of the Manila colleges, is looked\nup to in a true hero-worshiping attitude by all who either know him or\nhear of his fame. Life in such a place is one long state of harmless\ninactivity. Not a wave of trouble from the great outer world ever\ndisturbs its peaceful repose. One lounges forever in an air of\nindolent ease and extreme aversion to anything approaching what might\nbe called a respectable effort.\n\nOne arises in the morning about the time the sun's first rays silver\nthe top leaves of the cocoanut trees and then stirs around until nine\nor ten o'clock, when it is found expedient to avoid a further exposure\nto the sun. From then until about five o'clock in the afternoon it is\nbest to take things as they come, even though one of those things be a\nFilipino dinner. But then you may have your vehiclo attached to a\nyoung bull with a ring in his nose and go for a drive. If it is the\ndry season you will probably enjoy the drive unless you object to the\nfrequent clouds of dust swept along by the evening wind. If it is in\nthe rainy season your pleasure will depend to a considerable extent\nupon how wet you get; but, whether the season be wet or dry, your\npleasure will be regulated largely by the state of harmony existing\nbetween the driver and the bull.\n\nIn these quiet secluded nooks successive generations of Filipinos are\nborn, reared, grow old and die in an even chain of events broken only\nby the occasional erection of a new grass house on the identical spot\nwhere its predecessors have stood for ages. The son lives in the house\nof his father, cultivates the same few square feet of soil planted in\nedible roots, climbs the same cocoanut trees, follows the same winding\npath down to the stream, pounds rice in the same mortar and with the\nsame stick that his ancestors have used from time unremembered, and,\nin case of illness, curls up on a grass mat in a corner of the room\nuntil he dies or by some good fortune recovers. Beyond this narrow\nhorizon he never looks. So narrow and contracted is the life that the\nlanguages of two towns a few miles apart are so different that one\nwould scarcely recognize them as belonging to the same race of people.\n\nSuch are the two extremes of life in our new far Eastern provinces:\nthe one is active, progressive, and cosmopolitan; the other, inactive,\ndecadent, and narrow; but, whether one enjoys the first or endures the\nsecond, there comes to him after leaving a longing to lounge again in\ntropic airs and listen to the lullaby of the winds among the palms.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VII. - THE FILIPINO AT HOME.\n\n\nAs one enters a Filipino sitting-room for the first time, there is one\nfeature in the arrangement of the furniture that impresses itself upon\nhim at once, and it may be stated without fear of serious\ncontradiction that this same peculiar feature in its arrangement will\ncontinue to face him, as he enters different homes, about as certainly\nas he crosses the threshold.\n\nThe arrangement referred to is that of one large mirror, one settee,\nand some ten or a dozen chairs that appear to have had a certain\norderly affection for one another. The mirror is hung upon one of the\nlarge interior parts of the house about four feet above the floor. The\nwooden houses in the Philippines are built by setting large posts\nupright into the ground, extending into the air from twenty to thirty\nfeet. Cross timbers are fastened to these upright posts about eight or\nten feet above the ground and then not sawed off even with the posts,\nbut allowed to extend beyond them each way. The framework of the house\nis built upon these extending cross timbers, a style of building by\nwhich these large upright posts are left standing out on the inside of\nthe room from one to three feet from the walls. It is on that one of\nthese posts most nearly opposite the door that the mirror always finds\nits place. Immediately beneath the mirror is the settee; and the\nchairs are arranged in two parallel lines facing one another and at\nright angles with the ends of the settee. However odd this arrangement\nmay appear to one when he first enters a Filipino drawing-room, there\nare two things to be said in its favor. In the first place, it places\nyou face to face with the person with whom you are conversing so that\nyou can watch him,--a matter of no small moment in the Philippines. In\nthe next place, it enables you to give one of the young ladies a\nsheep's-eye in the mirror while the others present are left where\nMoses was in our much abused conundrum.\n\nThe size of the residence and the quality of its furnishings depends\nupon the wealth of the owner. But there is so vast a difference\nbetween the mode of life of the highest class and the tao, or lowest\nclass, that it is well to speak of them separately, and the great\nmiddle class of Filipinos can easily be imagined to occupy the\nintervening ground.\n\nThe rich Filipino's house is usually of wood built upon a wall of\nstone or brick from ten to fifteen feet high. The floors are kept\nhighly polished in his hallway, dressing-room, and bed-rooms. There\nare, of course, no fire-places in any of the rooms, but on some\noccasions something is needed to dry the rain-soaked atmosphere, for\neven in the dry season it has been seen to rain for five successive\ndays and nights without the cessation of a moment.\n\nA long chain of dependents is attached to the household of the rich\nFilipino. The master has his special body servant to be present at all\ntimes to do his master's bidding, in short, to be the visible\nmechanism of his master's volition. So, too, the lady of the house has\nher servant woman to do the slightest bidding of her ladyship. Then\nthere is the cook who is almost invariably a man, a house boy or two,\nand the coachman. These functionaries, with their assistants and\nassistants to the assistants, together with a servant or two for the\nexclusive service of the children, complete the economic household.\n\nSuch a family has an abundance of rice and wheat bread, also of\nchicken and fish with occasional fresh beef. They have also a good\ndeal of dulce. They regularly serve wine and frequently serve beer\non their tables.\n\nIn strong contrast with this mode of life is that of the tao. His\ndiet consists almost wholly of rice and small uncleaned fish boiled\ntogether. As a rule knife, fork, plate, and spoon find no place in his\nhousehold. The rice and fish are boiled in a pot and then allowed to\ncool in the same vessel or poured out to cool in a large earthen or\nwooden bowl. Then Mr. Tao together with Mrs. Tao and all the young\nTaos squat on their heels around the mixture and satisfy that\nintangible thing called the appetite. They do not use chop sticks as\nthe Chinese do, but the rice and fish are caught in a hollow formed by\nthe first three fingers of the right hand. The thumb is then placed\nbehind the mass. It is raised up and poised before the mouth, with a\nskill coming from the evolution of ages, when a contraction of the\nmuscles of the thumb throws the mass into the mouth with a skill that\nis marvelous to any but a Filipino. To judge from the most reliable\ninformation, the poorest class do not have an abundance of food,\nalthough it would seem that such a condition of things would be\nwell-nigh impossible. However, in a census of one hundred school\nchildren there were found six boys and four girls who declared that\nthey had never had enough to eat, and the native teacher stated that\nthis was probably true.\n\nThe wide gulf between the tao and the rich man is filled by the\ngreat middle class of Filipinos.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VIII. - VISIT TO A LEPER COLONY.\n\n\nNot far from our town was a leper colony and the first Saturday that\ncould be spared was set aside for a trip to the place. It happened\nthat none of the other Americans were at leisure on this particular\nmorning, but, rather then delay the trip or miss it altogether, the\nwriter, armed with a revolver, started out alone.\n\nThe road had been described so accurately by one who was supposed to\nknow it that it was deemed well-nigh impossible to miss the way. The\nmain highway was followed to the point where the by-path supposed to\nlead to the settlement turned off through some bamboo thickets and a\nlow tropical wood. This path led straight away towards the sea-coast\nwhere the houses of the colony were said to stand in a cocoanut grove\nby the beach.\n\nUpon arriving at the settlement, a very inhospitable reception was\nreceived from a mangy cur that growled and showed a very uninviting\nset of sharp, white teeth behind his snarling lips. The growling of\nthe dog had attracted the attention of an old man who, with age-bent\nback, was pounding rice in a mortar about fifty yards away. He turned\nslowly around and, upon seeing an intruder into the primitive quiet of\nthe place, gave a sharp, far-reaching call. The sound had scarcely\nrung through the grove when from about a dozen of the little grass\nhouses dotted here and there fifteen or twenty men armed with bolos\ncame out and gathered around the old man. A sense of my danger flashed\nupon me. Three miles from town and alone in a tropical jungle, I could\nbe almost instantly overcome by this band of bolo-men, and the only\nreport that would ever reach my people would be that I had\n\"disappeared.\" Of course, attack was by no means certain, but the\npotentiality of the situation was thrilling. A drawn revolver and the\ngleaming of its shining barrel had the effect of stopping the men, who\nseemed to be hesitating as to a course of action, until a somewhat\ndignified retreat was made to an open space in the rear from where a\nless dignified and a more hasty retreat began which did not stop short\nof Bacalod.\n\nEnough had been seen, however, even in this short visit, to give\nconvincing proof that the settlement visited was no colony of lepers;\nso, that afternoon two servant boys being taken as guides and\ninterpreters, another attempt was made to reach the goal desired.\n\nThis attempt was successful, and, after about two hours of walking, a\nlittle cluster of grass huts snugly hidden by the sea-coast came into\nview. As we approached, one would have thought it a gala-day. Some few\nchildren, apparently from six to thirteen years of age, almost wholly\nnude, were romping and playing in the open space around which the huts\nstood, and no one would ever have thought that any cloud so horrible\nas leprosy could hover over a place apparently so happy.\n\nBy the side of the path as we passed was a man and his wife setting\nout potato plants. His hands were so puffed and his fingers so short\nthat he could scarcely use them, but he was working along as best he\ncould. His wife's feet were so swollen and twisted that she walked\nonly with the greatest difficulty. We passed them by and entered the\nopen space above referred to.\n\nThe children now saw us, and those of them who could darted away like\nfrightened rabbits, each to his own burrow. An old man who was sitting\nin the warm afternoon sun on the little bamboo platform before his hut\nwas aroused from his lethargic repose by the scampering away of the\nchildren. He arose, trembling upon his tottering limbs, all drawn and\ntwisted, and hobbled away into his hut.\n\nThe children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at\nthe doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of\nthe settlement. In a few moments we were surrounded by a circle of\nhuman beings at once so repulsive and so pitiable that its graphic\nvividness can never be accurately portrayed.\n\nThe old man referred to above, having put on a pair of snow-white\npantaloons, appeared now at the doorway of his hut, followed a few\nmoments later by his wife who had evidently clothed herself in the\nbest raiment she had. At a call from the old man, all the men, women,\nand children in the settlement came out of their huts and stood in a\nline before us. The old man was spokesman and in his native visayan\ntongue made a heart-rending appeal for aid which we were powerless to\ngive. Attention was called to a leper woman, apparently about\ntwenty-five years of age, whose face had been attacked by the disease\nand whose appearance was truly pathetic. Upon her hip was a child\nabout a year and a half old and, strange to say, the child showed as\nyet no signs whatever of the disease.\n\nWhat an indissoluble enigma is life! Here in a little cluster of grass\nhuts in a secluded nook of a secluded island of an all but secluded\narchipelago was gathered together a little community of wretched\nnatives, driven by their loathsomeness from association with others\neven of the same half-savage race. Yet here, men and women loved and\nwere married, by mutual trust if not by law, and children were born of\nthe union to live forever under the unspeakable horror that\novershadowed the unfortunate parents. Love, hatred, sorrow, and\njoy--every passion that enters into the complex structure of the human\nheart even here, in this scene of sadness and despair, was playing\napparently as freely as where misfortune and disease had never crossed\nthe portals of life.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER IX. - A \"HIKE.\"\n\n\nWe were lounging lazily in our hammocks at Jimamaylan one evening in\nApril. Supper was just ended, and the soldiers in the post were\ncollected in groups here and there spinning yarns to pass away the\ntime, when a Filipino clad only in a loin cloth came down the street\nat a steadily swinging run and stopped in front of the sentry. He\nbrought the announcement that a band of ladrones had just burned a\nsugar mill and were advancing to sack a barrio about fifteen miles\naway.\n\nThe invitation of the commanding officer to go on a \"hike\" was eagerly\naccepted, and, in ten minutes after the message was given, the troops\nwere on the march followed by two adventurous pedagogues.\n\nDarkness was just closing in as we left the town, but a resplendent\ntropic moon soon made the night almost as brilliant as the day. The\ntrail we followed led over rough and rocky country. Sometimes for a\ndistance of a mile or more we passed over barren wastes of volcanic\nslag poured out in anger by some peak whose convulsions have long\nsince ceased. Again we would descend into a tropical jungle from the\ndense foliage of which the ladrones could have leaped at any moment,\nhad they known of our coming, and annihilated our little band. We\nforded rapid streams with the water at our breasts, and halted only\nonce in that rapid march of fifteen miles.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the town we met a man who was standing\nguard against a surprise by the ladrones. Nothing could well have been\nmuch more grotesque and nothing could much better illustrate the\nabsolutely primitive condition of the Filipinos in the interior of the\nislands than the appearance of this guard. A pair of knee pants, a\nconical grass hat, and a hemp shirt formed his entire apparel. A long\nflat wooden shield, a bolo, and a long bamboo spear with a sharp,\nflat, iron point, completed his equipment for battle.\n\nHere stood the first and the twentieth centuries side by side. The\nFilipino who had advanced only a stage beyond the condition of\nprimitive man with his knife, spear, and wooden shield, stood side by\nside with the American soldier, a representative of modern life with\nhis magazine rifle, his canteen, his knapsack,--with every article of\nhis clothing made to give him the highest possible efficiency as the\nunit of a military organization.\n\nA few yards farther on we met another guard equipped similarly to the\nfirst. Upon reaching the town, news had just been received that a\ndetachment of troops from another post had intercepted the ladrones\nand fought a skirmish with them. The ladrones had escaped and we set\nout in pursuit of them on a chase wilder than a Quixotic dream. We\nwound our way into the mountains behind the town, inquiring at every\ngrass hut we passed whether the band of ladrones had passed that way,\nbut only once was even a trace of them found. Then it was learned that\nat a certain place they had separated into groups of three or four and\ngone glimmering through the dream of things that were. This place was\nin a secluded nook of the mountains where in years gone by some\nadventurous Spaniard had erected a primitive water mill to grind his\nsugar-cane. We had now marched about twenty miles and the feet of the\npedagogues were a mass of blisters. They had reached the point where\nthat form of military maneuvering called \"hiking\" ceased to possess\nany alluring charms. So a native was persuaded to come out of his lone\nmountain hut and hitch up his carabao and cart. He was then made to\nget on the carabao's back, while the aforesaid pedagogues lay down on\nthe sugar-cane pulp that had been put into the body of the cart, and\nthe driver was instructed to start for the post we had left hours\nbefore, and not to stop until he got there. Being uncertain but that\nsome of the ladrones would learn of our having left the body of troops\nand would try the metal of our steel, we at first agreed that neither\nof us should go to sleep, but it was later decided that probably the\ndriver had no greater desire to cross the Styx than his passengers had\nand that in case of danger he would awaken us, so both took a revolver\nin each hand, stretched out supinely and went to sleep.\n\nSuch a sleep! The rough jolting of the cart over an almost impassable\nroad was never enough to break the spell of slumber. When we awoke the\nblazing tropic sun was past the midday mark of morning, shining full\ninto our unprotected and well-nigh blistered faces.\n\nA pack of dogs were heralding our approach to a little village at the\nfoot of the mountains where ponies were procured to take us back to\nthe post.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he insists, \"have stood the test of ages; and the plant\nevery where retained its name and credit: and one of our good\nherbarists, who had seen a wonderful case of a swoln spleen, so big, and\nhard as to be felt with terror, brought back to a state of nature by it\"\n\n(p. 37). The greatest portion of Hill's concluding section combines\nadvertisement for the powder medicine he was himself manufacturing at a\nhandsome profit together with a protest against competing apothecaries:\n\"An intelligent person was directed to go to the medicinal herb shops in\nthe several markets, and buy some of this Spleen-wort; the name was\nwritten, and shewn to every one; every shop received his money, and\nalmost every one sold a different plant, under the name of this: but\nwhat is very striking, not one of them the right\" (p. 42).\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis did not cease to be printed after Hill's in\n1766, but continued to issue from the presses into the nineteenth\ncentury. A good example of this is the tome by John Reid, physician to\nthe Finsbury Dispensary in London, Essays on Insanity, Hypochondriasis\nand Other Nervous Affections (1816), which summarizes theories of the\nmalady. A bibliographical study of such works would probably reveal\na larger number of titles in the nineteenth century than in the previous\none, but by this time the nature and definition of hypochondria had\nchanged significantly.\n\nIf John Hill's volume is not an important contribution in the history of\nmedicine, it is a lucid and brief exposition of many of the best ideas\nthat had been thought and written on the hyp, with the exception of his\nuninhibited prescribing of herbal medicines as cure-alls. An\nunderstanding of this disease is essential for readers of neoclassical\nEnglish literature, especially when we reflect upon the fact that some\nof the best literature of the period was composed by writers whom it\nafflicted. It is perhaps not without significance that the greatest poet\nof the Augustan age, Alexander Pope, thought it necessary as he lay on\nhis deathbed in May 1744 to exclaim with his last breath, \"I never was\nhippish in my whole life.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. I. - The NATURE of the DISORDER.\n\n\nTo call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and cruel. It\nis a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by thickened\nand distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver, and other\nparts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick scarce knows\none more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\n\nThe blood is a mixture of many fluids, which, in a state of health, are\nso combined, that the whole passes freely through its appointed vessels;\nbut if by the loss of the thinner parts, the rest becomes too gross to\nbe thus carried through, it will stop where the circulation has least\npower; and having thus stopped it will accumulate; heaping by degrees\nobstruction on obstruction.\n\nHealth and chearfulness, and the quiet exercise of mind, depend upon a\nperfect circulation: is it a wonder then, when this becomes impeded the\nbody looses of its health, and the temper of its sprightliness? to be\notherwise would be the miracle; and he inhumanly insults the afflicted,\nwho calls all this a voluntary frowardness. Its slightest state brings\nwith it sickness, anguish and oppression; and innumerable ills follow\nits advancing steps, unless prevented by timely care; till life itself\ngrows burthensome.\n\nThe disease was common in antient Greece; and her physicians understood\nit, better than those perhaps of later times, in any other country; who\nthough happy in many advantages these fathers of the science could not\nhave, yet want the great assistance of frequent watching it in all its\nstages.\n\nThose venerable writers have delivered its nature, and its cure: in the\nfirst every thing now shews they were right; and what they have said as\nto the latter will be found equally true and certain. This, so far as\npresent experience has confirmed it, and no farther, will be here laid\nbefore the afflicted in a few plain words.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. II. - Persons Subject to it.\n\n\nFatigue of mind, and great exertion of its powers often give birth to\nthis disease; and always tend to encrease it. The finer spirits are\nwasted by the labour of the brain: the Philosopher rises from his study\nmore exhausted than the Peasant leaves his drudgery; without the benefit\nthat he has from exercise. Greatness of mind, and steady virtue;\ndetermined resolution, and manly firmness, when put in action, and\nintent upon their object, all also lead to it: perhaps whatever tends to\nthe ennobling of the soul has equal share in bringing on this weakness\nof the body.\n\nFrom this we may learn easily who are the men most subject to it; the\ngrave and studious, those of a sedate temper and enlarged understanding,\nthe learned and wise, the virtuous and the valiant: those whom it were\nthe interest of the world to wish were free from this and every other\nillness; and who perhaps, except for this alloy, would have too large a\nportion of human happiness.\n\nThough these are most, it is not these alone, who are subject to it.\n\nThere are countries where it is endemial, and in other places some have\nthe seeds of it in their constitution; and in some it takes rise from\naccidents. In these last it is the easiest of cure; and in the first\nmost difficult.\n\nBeside the Greeks already named, the Jews of old time were heavily\nafflicted with this disease; and in their descendants to this day it is\noften constitutional: the Spaniards have it almost to a man; and so have\nthe American Indians. Perhaps the character of these several nations may\nbe connected with it. The steady honour, and firm valour of the\nSpaniard, very like that of the ancient Doric nation, who followed the\nflute not the trumpet to the field; and met the enemy, not with shouts\nand fury, but with a determined virtue: it is the temper of the\nHypochondriac to be slow, but unmoveably resolved: the Jew has shewn\nthis mistakenly, but almost miraculously; and the poor Indian, untaught\nas he is, faces all peril with composure, and sings his death-song with\nan unalter'd countenance.\n\nAmong particular persons the most inquiring and contemplative are those\nwho suffer oftenest by this disease; and of all degrees of men I think\nthe clergy. I do not mean the hunting, shooting, drinking clergy, who\nbear the tables of the great; but the retir'd and conscientious; such as\nattend in midnight silence to their duty; and seek in their own cool\nbreasts, or wheresoever else they may be found, new admonitions for an\nage plunged in new vices. To this disease we owe the irreparable loss of\nDr. YOUNG; and the present danger of many other the best and most\nimproved amongst us. May what is here to be proposed assist in their\npreservation!\n\nThe Geometrician or the learned Philosopher of whatever denomination,\nwhose course of study fixes his eye for ever on one object, his mind\nintensely and continually employed upon one thought, should be warned\nalso that he is in danger; or if he find himself already afflicted, he\nshould be told that the same course of life, which brought it on, will,\nwithout due care, encrease it to the most dreaded violence.\n\nThe middle period of life is that in which there is the greatest danger\nof an attack from this disease; and the latter end of autumn, when the\nsummer heats have a little time been over, is the season when in our\nclimate its first assaults are most to be expected. The same time of the\nyear always increases the disorder in those who have been before\nafflicted with it; and it is a truth must be confessed, that from its\nfirst attack the patient grows continually, though slowly, worse; unless\na careful regimen prevent it.\n\nThe constitutions most liable to this obstruction are the lean, and dark\ncomplexioned; the grave and sedentary. Let such watch the first\nsymptoms; and obviate, (as they may with ease) that which it will be\nmuch more difficult to remove.\n\nIt is happy a disease, wherein the patient must do a great deal for\nhimself, falls, for the most part, upon those who have the powers of\nreason strongest. Let them only be aware of this, that the distemper\nnaturally disposes them to inactivity; and reason will have no use\nunless accompanied with resolution to enforce it.\n\nThough the physician can do something toward the cure, much more depends\nupon the patient; and here his constancy of mind will be employed most\nhappily. No one is better qualified to judge on a fair hearing what\ncourse is the most fit; and having made that choice, he must with\npatience wait its good effects. Diseases that come on slowly must have\ntime for curing; an attention to the first appearances of the disorder\nwill be always happiest; because when least established it is easiest\noverthrown: but when that happy period has been neglected, he must wait\nthe effects of such a course as will dilute and melt the obstructing\nmatter gradually; for till that be done it is not only vain, but\nsometimes dangerous, to attempt its expulsion from the body.\n\nThe blood easily separates itself into the grosser and the thinner\nparts: we see this in bleeding; and from the toughness of the red cake\nmay guess how very difficult it will be to dissolve a substance of like\nfirmness in the vessels of the body. That it can thus become thickened\nwithin the body, a Pleurisy shews us too evidently: in that case it is\nbrought on suddenly, and with inflammation; in this other, slowly and\nwithout; and here, even before it forms the obstruction, can bring on\nmany mischiefs. Various causes can produce the same effect, but that in\nall cases operates most durably, which operates most slowly. The watery\npart of the blood is its mild part; in the remaining gross matter of it,\nare acrid salts and burning oils, and these, when destitute of that\nhappy dilution nature gives them in a healthy body, are capable of doing\ngreat mischief to the tender vessels in which they are kept stagnant.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. III. - The SYMPTOMS of the DISORDER.\n\n\nThe first and lightest of the signs that shew this illness are a lowness\nof spirits, and inaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love\nof solitude and a habit of thinking, even on trifling subjects, with too\nmuch steadiness. A very little help may combat these: but if that\nindolence which is indeed a part of the disorder, will neglect them;\nworse must be expected soon to follow.\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness, weight, and oppression in the body,\na want of appetite, or, what is worse, an appetite without digestion;\nfor these are the conditions of different states of the disease, a\nfullness and a difficulty of breathing after meals, a straitness of the\nbreast, pains and flatulencies in the bowels, and an unaptness to\ndischarge their contents.\n\nThe pulse becomes low, weak, and unequal; and there are frequent\npalpitations of the heart, a little dark-coloured urine is voided at\nsome times; and a flood of colourless and insipid at others; relieving\nfor a moment, but increasing the distemper: there is in some cases also\na continual teazing cough, with a choaking stoppage in the throat at\ntimes; then heartburn, sickness, hardness of the belly, and a costive\nhabit, or a tormenting and vain irritation.\n\nThe lips turn pale, the eyes loose their brightness and by degrees the\nwhite grows as it were greenish, the gums want their due firmness, with\ntheir proper colour; and an unpleasing foulness grows upon the teeth:\nthe inside of the mouth is pale and furred, and the throat dry and\nhusky: the colour of the skin is pale (though there are periods when the\nface is florid) and as the obstruction gathers ground, and more affects\nthe liver, the whole body becomes yellow, tawny, greenish, and at length\nof that deep and dusky hue, to which men of swift imagination have given\nthe name of blackness.\n\nThese symptoms do not all appear in any one period of the disease, or in\none case, but at one time or other all of them, as well as those which\nfollow: the flesh becomes cold to the touch, though the patient does not\nhimself perceive it; the limbs grow numbed and torpid, the breathing\ndull and slow, and the voice hollow; and usually the appetite in this\nperiod declines, and comes almost to nothing: night sweats come on,\nblack swellings appear on the veins, the flesh wastes and the breast\nbecomes flat and hollow: the mouth is full of a thin spittle, the head\nis dizzy and confus'd, and sometimes there is an unconquerable numbness\nin the organs of speech.\n\nI have known the temporary silence that follows upon this last symptom\nbecome a jest to the common herd; and the unhappy patient, instead of\ncompassion and assistance, receive the reproof of sullenness, from those\nwho should have known and acted better.\n\nAbout twenty years ago I met on a visit at Catthorpe in Leicestershire a\nyoung gentleman of distinguished learning and abilities, who at certain\ntimes was speechless. The vulgar thought it a pretence: and a jocose\nlady, where he was at tea with company, putting him as she said to a\ntrial, poured out a dish very strong and without sugar. He drank it and\nreturned the cup with a bow of great reserve, and his eye bent on the\nground: she then filled the cup with sugar, and pouring weak tea on it,\nsent it him: he drank that too, looked at her steadily, and blushed for\nher. The lady declared the man was dumb; the rest thought him perverse,\nand obstinate; but a constant and steady perseverance in an easy method\ncured him.\n\nAll these are miseries which the disease, while it retains its natural\nform, can bring upon the patient; and thus he will in time be worn out,\nand led miserably, though slowly, to the grave. Let him not indulge his\ninactivity so far as to give way to this, because it is represented as\nfar off; the disease may suddenly and frightfully change its nature; and\nswifter evils follow.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. IV. - The DANGER.\n\n\nWe have done with the obstruction considered in itself; but this, though\noften unsurmountable by art, at least by the methods now in use, will be\nsometimes broken through at once by nature, or by accidents; and bring\non fatal evils. These are strictly different diseases, and are no\notherway concerned here, than as the consequences of that of which we\nare treating.\n\nThe thick and glutinous blood which has so long stagnated in the spleen,\nwill have in that time altered its nature, and acquired a very great\ndegree of acrimony: while it lies dormant, this does no more mischiefs,\nthan those named already; but when violent exercise, a fit of outrageous\nanger, or any thing else that suddenly shocks and disturbs the frame,\nputs it in motion, it melts at once into a kind of liquid putrefaction.\n\nBeing now thin, it mixes itself readily with the blood again, and brings\non putrid fevers; destroys the substance of the spleen itself, or being\nthrown upon some other of the viscera, corrodes them, and leads on this\nway a swift and miserable death. If it fall upon the liver, its tender\npulpy substance is soon destroyed, jaundices beyond the help of art\nfirst follow, then dropsies and all their train of misery; if on lungs,\nconsumptions; if on the brain, convulsions, epilepsy, palsy, apoplexy;\nif on the surface, leprosy.\n\nThe intention of cure is to melt this coagulation softly, not to break\nit violently; and then to give it a very gentle passage through the\nbowels. There is no safe way for it to take but that; and even that when\nurged too far may bring on fatal dysenteries.\n\nLet none wonder at the sudden devastation which sometimes arises from\nthis long stagnant matter, when liquified too hastily: how long, how\nmany years the impacted matter will continue quiet in a schirrous tumour\nof the breast; but being once put in motion, whether from accident, or\nin the course of nature, what can describe; or what can stop its\nhavock!\n\nInstances of the other are too frequent. A nobleman the other day died\nparalytick: dissection shewed a spleen consumed by an abscess, formed\nfrom the dissolved matter of such an obstruction: and 'tis scarce longer\nsince, a learned gentleman, who had been several years lost to his\nfriends, by the extreams of a Hypochondriacal disorder, seem'd gradually\nwithout assistance to recover: but the lungs suffered while the spleen\nwas freed; and he died very soon of what is called a galloping\nconsumption.\n\nWhen the obstruction is great and of long continuance, if it be thus\nhastily moved, the consequence is, equally, a sudden and a miserable\ndeath, whether, like the matter of a cancer, it remains in its place; or\nlike that of a bad small pox, be thrown upon some other vital part.\n\nLet not the patient be too much alarmed; this is laid down to caution,\nnot to terrify him: it is fit he should know his danger, and attend to\nit; for the prevention is easy; and the cure, even of the most advanced\nstages, when undertaken by gentle means, is not at all impracticable: to\nassist the physician, let him look into himself, and recollect the\nsource of his complaint. This he may judge of from the following\nnotices.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. V. - The Causes of the HYPOCHONDRIASIS.\n\n\nThe obstruction which forms this disease, may take its origin from\ndifferent accidents: a fever ill cured has often caused it; or the\npiles, which had been used to discharge largely, ceasing; a marshy soil,\npoisoned with stagnant water, has given it to some persons; and altho'\nindolence and inactivity are oftenest at the root, yet it has arisen\nfrom too great exercise.\n\nReal grief has often brought it on; and even love, for sometimes that is\nreal. Study and fixed attention of the mind have been accused before;\nand add to these the stooping posture of the body, which most men use,\nthough none should use it, in writing and in reading. This has\ncontributed too much to it; but of all other things night studies are\nthe most destructive. The steady stillness, and dusky habit of all\nnature in those hours, enforce, encourage, and support that settled\ngloom, which rises from fixt thought; and sinks the body to the grave;\neven while it carries up the mind to heaven. He who would have his lamp\n        At midnight hour\n  Be seen in some high lonely tower,\nwill waste the flame of this unheeded life: and while he labours to\nunsphere the spirit of Plato will let loose his own.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VI. - The Cure of the HYPOCHONDRIASIS.\n\n\nLet him who would escape the mischiefs of an obstructed spleen, avoid\nthe things here named: and let him who suffers from the malady,\nendeavour to remember to which of them it has been owing; for half the\nhope depends upon that knowledge.\n\nNature has sometimes made a cure herself, and we should watch her ways;\nfor art never is so right as when it imitates her: sometimes the\npatient's own resolution has set him free. This is always in his power,\nand at all times will do wonders.\n\nThe bleeding of the piles, from nature's single efforts, has at once\ncured a miserable man; where their cessation was the cause of the\ndisorder. A leprosy has appeared upon the skin, and all the symptoms of\nthe former sickness vanished. This among the Jews happened often: both\ndiseases we know were common among them: and I have here seen something\nvery like it: Water-Dock has thrown out scorbutic eruptions, and all the\nformer symptoms of an Hypochondriacal disorder have disappeared:\nreturning indeed when these were unadvisedly struck in; but keeping off\nentirely when they were better treated. A natural purging unsuppressed\nhas sometimes done the same good office: but this is hazardous.\n\nIt is easy to be directed from such instances; only let us take the\nwhole along with us. Bleeding would have answered nature's purpose, if\nshe could not have opened of herself the h\u00e6morrhoidal vessels; but he\nwho should give medicines for that purpose, might destroy his patient by\ntoo great disturbance. If a natural looseness may perform the cure, so\nmay an artificial; when the original source of the disorder points that\nway. But these are helps that take place only in particular cases.\n\nThe general and universal method of cure must be by some mild and gently\nresolving medicine, under the influence of which the obstructing matter\nmay be voided that, or some other way with safety. The best season to\nundertake this is the autumn, but even here there must be caution.\n\nIn the first place, no strong evacuating remedy must be given; for that,\nby carrying off the thinner parts of the juices, will tend to thicken\nthe remainder; and certainly encrease the distemper. No acrid medicine\nmust be directed, for that may act too hastily, dissolve the impacted\nmatter at once, and let it loose, to the destruction of the sufferer; no\nantimonial, no mercurial, no martial preparation must be taken; in\nshort, no chymistry: nature is the shop that heaven has set before us,\nand we must seek our medicine there. The venerable ancients, who knew\nnot this new art, will lead us in the search; and (faithful relators as\nthey are of truth) will tell us whence we may deduce our hope; and what\nwe are to fear.\n\nBut prior to the course of any medicine, and as an essential to any good\nhope from it, the patient must prescribe himself a proper course of\nlife, and a well chosen diet: let us assist him in his choice; and speak\nof this first, as it comes first in order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VI. - Rules of Life for Hypochondriac Persons.\n\n\nAir and exercise, as they are the best preservers of health, and\ngreatest assistants in the cure of all long continued diseases, will\nhave their full effect in this; but there requires some caution in the\nchoice, and management of them. It is common to think the air of high\ngrounds best; but experience near home shews otherwise: the\nHypochondriac patient is always worse at Highgate even than in London.\n\nThe air he breathes should be temperate; not exposed to the utmost\nviolences of heat and cold, and the swift changes from one to the\nother; which are most felt on those high grounds. The side of a hill is\nthe best place for him: and though wet grounds are hurtful; yet let\nthere be the shade of trees, to tempt him often to a walk; and soften by\ntheir exhalation the over dryness of the air.\n\nThe exercise he takes should be frequent; but not violent. Motion\npreserves the firmness of the parts, and elasticity of the vessels; it\nprevents that aggregation of thick humours which he is most to fear. A\nsedentary life always produces weakness, and that mischief always\nfollows: weak eyes are gummy, weak lungs are clogged with phlegm, and\nweak bowels waste themselves in vapid diarrhoeas.\n\nLet him invite himself abroad, and let his friends invite him by every\ninnocent inducement. For me, I should advise above all other things the\nstudy of nature. Let him begin with plants: he will here find a\ncontinual pleasure, and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful\nthings; even of the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to\nwalk; and every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket,\nwill afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually\nin the air, and continually to change the nature and quality of the air,\nby visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the lawn, the\nheath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be abroad; and the\nunceasing variety of the subjects of his observation, will prevent his\nwalking hastily: he will pursue his studies in the air; and that\ncontemplative turn of mind, which in his closet threatened his\ndestruction, will thus become the great means of his recovery.\n\nIf the mind tire upon this, from the repeated use, another of nature's\nkingdoms opens itself at once upon him; the plant he is weary of\nobserving, feeds some insect he may examine; nor is there a stone that\nlies before his foot, but may afford instruction and amusement.\n\nEven what the vulgar call the most abject things will shew a wonderful\nutility; and lead the mind, in pious contemplation higher than the\nstars. The poorest moss that is trampled under foot, has its important\nuses: is it at the bottom of a wood we find it? why there it shelters\nthe fallen seeds; hides them from birds, and covers them from frost;\nand thus becomes the foster father of another forest! creeps it along\nthe surface of a rock? even there its good is infinite! its small roots\nrun into the stone, and the rains make their way after them; the moss\nhaving lived its time dies; it rots and with the mouldered fragments of\nthe stone forms earth; wherein, after a few successions, useful plants\nmay grow, and feed more useful cattle!\n\nIs there a weed more humble in its aspect, more trampled on, or more\ndespised than knot grass! no art can get the better of its growth, no\nlabour can destroy it; 'twere pity if they could, for the thing lives\nwhere nothing would of use to us; and its large and most wonderfully\nabundant seeds, feed in hard winters, half the birds of Heaven.\n\nWhat the weak moss performs upon the rock the loathed toadstool brings\nabout in timber: is an oak dead where man's eye will not find it? this\nfungus roots itself upon the bark, and rots the wood beneath it; hither\nthe beetle creeps for shelter, and for sustenance; him the woodpecker\nfollows as his prey; and while he tears the tree in search of him, he\nscatters it about the ground; which it manures.\n\nNor is it the beetle alone that thus insinuates itself into the\nsubstance of the vegetable tribe: the tender aphide, whom a touch\ndestroys, burrows between the two skins of a leaf, for shelter from his\nwinged enemies; tracing, with more than Dedal\u00e6an art, his various\nmeanders; and veining the green surface with these white lines more\nbeautifully than the best \u00c6gyptian marble.\n\n'Twere endless to proceed; nor is it needful: one object will not fail\nto lead on to another, and every where the goodness of his God will\nshine before him even in what are thought the vilest things; his\ngreatness in the lead of them.\n\nLet him pursue these thoughts, and seek abroad the objects and the\ninstigations to them: but let him in these and all other excursions\navoid equally the dews of early morning, and of evening.\n\nThe more than usual exercise of this prescription will dispose him to\nmore than customary sleep, let him indulge it freely; so far from\nhurting, it will help his cure.\n\nLet him avoid all excesses: drink need scarce be named, for we are\nwriting to men of better and of nobler minds, than can be tempted to\nthat humiliating vice. Those who in this disorder have too great an\nappetite, must not indulge it; much eaten was never well digested: but\nof all excesses the most fatal in this case is that of venery. It is the\nexcess we speak of.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VII. - The proper DIET.\n\n\nIn the first place acids must be avoided carefully; and all things that\nare in a state of fermentation, for they will breed acidity. Provisions\nhardened by salting never should be tasted; much less those cured by\nsmoaking, and by salting. Bacon is indigestible in an Hypochondriac\nstomach; and hams, impregnated as is now the custom, with acid fumes\nfrom the wood fires over which they are hung, have that additional\nmischief.\n\nMilk ought to be a great article in the diet: and even in this there\nshould be choice. The milk of grass-fed cows has its true quality: no\nother. There are a multitude of ways in which this may be made a part\nboth of our foods and drinks, and they should all be used.\n\nThe great and general caution is that the diet be at all times of a kind\nloosening and gently stimulating; light but not acrid. Veal, lamb,\nfowls, lobsters, crabs, craw-fish, fresh water fish and mutton broth,\nwith plenty of boiled vegetables, are always right; and give enough\nvariety.\n\nRaw vegetables are all bad: sour wines, old cheese, and bottled beer are\nthings never to be once tasted. Indeed much wine is wrong, be it of what\nkind soever. It is the first of cordials; and as such I would have it\ntaken in this disease when it is wanted: plainly as a medicine, rather\nthan a part of diet. Malt liquor carefully chosen is certainly the best\ndrink. This must be neither new, nor tending to sourness; perfectly\nclear, and of a moderate strength: it is the native liquor of our\ncountry, and the most healthful.\n\nToo much tea weakens; and even sugar is in this disorder hurtful: but\nhoney may supply its place in most things; and this is not only harmless\nbut medicinal; a very powerful dissolvent of impacted humours, and a\ngreat deobstruent.\n\nWhat wine is drank should be of some of the sweet kinds. Old Hock has\nbeen found on enquiry to yield more than ten times the acid of the sweet\nwines; and in red Port, at least in what we are content to call so,\nthere is an astringent quality, that is most mischievous in these cases:\nit is said there is often alum in it: how pregnant with mischief that\nmust be to persons whose bowels require to be kept open, is most\nevident. Summer fruits perfectly ripe are not only harmless but\nmedicinal; but if eaten unripe they will be very prejudicial. A light\nsupper, which will leave an appetite for a milk breakfast, is always\nright; this will not let the stomach be ravenous for dinner, as it is\napt to be in those who make that their only meal.\n\nOne caution more must be given, and it may seem a strange one: it is\nthat the patient attend regularly to his hours of eating. We have to do\nwith men for the most part whose soul is the great object of their\nregard; but let them not forget they have a body.\n\nThe late Dr. STUKELY has told me, that one day by appointment visiting\nSir ISAAC NEWTON, the servant told him, he was in his study. No one was\npermitted to disturb him there; but as it was near dinner time, the\nvisitor sat down to wait for him. After a time dinner was brought in; a\nboil'd chicken under a cover. An hour pass'd, and Sir ISAAC did not\nappear. The doctor eat the fowl, and covering up the empty dish, bad\nthem dress their master another. Before that was ready, the great man\ncame down; he apologiz'd for his delay, and added, \"give me but leave to\ntake my short dinner, and I shall be at your service; I am fatigued and\nfaint.\" Saying this, he lifted up the cover; and without any emotion,\nturned about to STUKELY with a smile; \"See says he, what we studious\npeople are, I forgot I had din'd.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VIII. - The MEDICINE.\n\n\n'Tis the ill fate of this disease, more than of all others to be\nmisunderstood at first, and thence neglected; till the physician shakes\nhis head at a few first questions. None steals so fatally upon the\nsufferer: its advances are by very slow degrees; but every day it grows\nmore difficult of cure.\n\nThat this obstruction in the spleen is the true malady, the cases\nrelated by the antients, present observation, and the unerring\ntestimonies of dissections leave no room to doubt. Being understood, the\npath is open where to seek a remedy: and our best guides in this, as in\nthe former instance, will be those venerable Greeks; who saw a thousand\nof these cases, where we see one; and with less than half our theory,\ncured twice as many patients.\n\nOne established doctrine holds place in all these writers; that whatever\nby a hasty fermentation dissolves the impacted matter of the\nobstruction, and sends it in that state into the blood, does incredible\nmischief: but that whatever medicine softens it by slow degrees, and, as\nit melts, delivers it to the bowels without disturbance; will cure with\nequal certainty and safety.\n\nFor this good purpose, they knew and tried a multitude of herbs; but in\nthe end they fixed on one: and on their repeated trials of this, they\nbanished all the rest. This stood alone for the cure of the disease; and\nfrom its virtue received the name of SPLEEN-WORT. O wise and happy\nGreeks! authors of knowledge and perpetuators of it! With them the very\nname they gave a plant declared its virtues: with us, a writer calls a\nplant from some friend; that the good gardener who receives the honour,\nmay call another by his name who gave it. We now add the term smooth\nto this herb, to distinguish it from another, called by the same general\nterm, though not much resembling it.\n\nThe virtues of this smooth Spleen-wort have flood the test of ages; and\nthe plant every where retained its name and credit: and one of our good\nherbalists, who had seen a wonderful case of a swoln spleen, so big, and\nhard as to be felt with terror, brought back to a state of nature by it;\nand all the miserable symptoms vanish; thought Spleen-wort not enough\nexpressive of its excellence; but stamp'd on it the name of MILT-WASTE.\n\nIn the Greek Islands now, the use of it is known to every one; and even\nthe lazy monks who take it, are no longer splenetic. In the west of\nEngland, the rocks are stripped of it with diligence; and every old woman\ntells you how charming that leaf is for bookish men: in Russia they use\na plant of this kind in their malt liquor: it came into fashion there\nfor the cure of this disease; which from its constant use is scarce\nknown any longer; and they suppose 'tis added to their liquor for a\nflavour.\n\nThe ancients held it in a kind of veneration; and used what has been\ncalled a superstition in the gathering it. It was to be taken up with a\nsharp knife, without violence, and laid upon the clean linen: no time\nbut the still darkness of the night was proper, and even the moon was\nnot to shine upon it. I know they have been ridiculed for this; for\nnothing is so vain as learned ignorance: but let me be permitted once to\nvindicate them.\n\nThe plant has leaves that can close in their sides; and their under part\nis covered thick with a yellow powder, consisting of the seeds, and seed\nvessels: in these they knew the virtue most resided: this was the golden\ndust they held so valuable; and this they knew they could not be too\ncautious to preserve. They were not ignorant of the sleep of plants; a\nmatter lately spoken of by some, as if a new discovery; and being\nsensible that light, a dry air, an expanded leaf, and a tempestuous\nseason, were the means of losing this fine dust; and knowing also that\ndarkness alone brought on that closing of the leaf which thence has\nbeen called sleep; and which helped to defend and to secure it, they\ntherefore took such time, and used such means as could best preserve the\nplant entire; and even save what might be scattered from it.--And now\nwhere is their superstition?\n\nFrom this plant thus collected they prepared a medicine, which in a\ncourse of forty days scarce ever failed to make a perfect cure.\n\nWe have the plant wild with us; and till the fashion of rough chemical\npreparations took off our attention from these gentler remedies, it was\nin frequent use and great repute. I trust it will be so again: and many\nthank me for restoring it to notice.\n\nSpleen-wort gives out its virtues freely in a tincture; and a small dose\nof this, mixing readily with the blood and juices, gradually dissolves\nthe obstruction; and by a little at a time delivers its contents to be\nthrown off without pain, from the bowels. Let this be done while the\nviscera are yet sound and the cure is perfect. More than the forty days\nof the Greek method is scarce ever required; much oftener two thirds of\nthat time suffice; and every day, from the first dose of it, the patient\nfeels the happy change that is growing in his constitution. His food no\nmore turns putrid on his stomach, but yields its healthful nourishment.\n\nThe swelling after meals therefore vanishes; and with that goes the\nlowness, and anxiety, the difficult breath, and the distracting cholick:\nhe can bear the approach of rainy weather without pain; he finds himself\nmore apt for motion, and ready to take that exercise which is to be\nassistant in his cure; life seems no longer burthensome. His bowels get\ninto the natural condition of health, and perform their office once at\nleast a day; better if a little more: the dull and dead colour of his\nskin goes off, his lips grow red again, and every sign of health\nreturns.\n\nLet him who takes the medicine, say whether any thing here be\nexaggerated. Let him, if he pleases to give himself the trouble, talk\nover with me, or write to me, this gradual decrease of his complaints,\nas he proceeds in his cure. My uncertain state of health does not\npermit me to practise physic in the usual way, but I am very desirous to\ndo what good I can, and shall never refuse my advice, such as it may be,\nto any person rich or poor, in whatever manner he may apply for it. I\nshall refer him to no apothecary, whose bills require he should be\ndrenched with potions; but tell him, in this as in all other cases,\nwhere to find some simple herb; which he may if he please prepare\nhimself; or if he had rather spare that trouble, may have it so prepared\nfrom me.\n\nWith regard to Spleen-wort, no method of using it is more effectual than\nsimply taking it in powder; the only advantage of a tincture, is that a\nproper dose may be given, and yet the stomach not be loaded with so\nlarge a quantity: it is an easier and pleasanter method, and nothing\nmore.\n\nIf any person choose to take it in the other way, I should still wish\nhim once at least to apply to me; that he may be assured what he is\nabout to take is the right plant. Abuses in medicines are at this time\nvery great, and in no instance worse than what relates to herbs. The\nbest of our physicians have complained upon this head with warmth, but\nwithout redress: they know the virtues and the value of many of our\nnative plants, but dread to prescribe them; lest some wrong thing should\nbe administered in their place; perhaps inefficacious, perhaps\nmischievous, nay it may be fatal. The few simple things I direct are\nalways before me; and it will at all times be a pleasure to me, in this\nand any other instance, to see whether what any person is about to take\nbe right. I have great obligations to the public, and this is the best\nreturn that I know how to make.\n\nTo see the need of such a caution, hear a transaction but of yesterday!\n\nAn intelligent person was directed to go to the medicinal herb shops in\nthe several markets, and buy some of this Spleen-wort; the name was\nwritten, and shewn to every one; every shop received his money, and\nalmost every one sold a different plant, under the name of this: but\nwhat is very striking, not one of them the right. Such is the chance of\nhealth in those hands through which the best means of it usually pass;\neven in the most regular course of application.\n\nI would not be understood to limit the little services I may this way be\nable to render the afflicted, to this single instance; much less to\npropose to myself any advantages from it. Whoever pleases will be\nwelcome to me, upon any such occasion; and whatever be the herb on which\nhe places a dependance, he shall be shewn it growing. I once recommended\na garden to be established for this use, at the public expence: one\ngreat person has put it in my power to answer all its purposes.\n\n                        F  I  N  I  S.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris, he was\n\"nominated\" to the Academy. He had but to present an Historical\nPainting in order to take his seat as an Academician.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VENUS AND MARRIAGE\n\n\nBack in his beloved Paris again; thrilled by the atmosphere and gaiety\nof its merry life; in the full vigour of manhood on the eve of his\nthirties; amongst congenial friends; done with the drudgery of winning\nto Academic honour, Boucher saw that the public were not falling over\neach other to purchase religious or historic pictures; he straightway\nturned his back upon these things, and on the edge of his thirtieth\nyear he gave to the world his \"Marriage of the Children of God with\nthe Children of Men,\" in which Venus is the avowed mistress of his\nadoration. It caused a fine stir, and greatly increased his repute.\n\nIn this picture he ends his Italian period and strikes his own\npersonal note. Both this and the \"Venus asking arms for Aeneas from\nVulcan,\" together with the \"Birth of Adonis\" and the \"Death of\nAdonis,\" of about the same period, still show Boucher strongly under\nthe influence of his master, Lemoyne. Indeed, the \"Birth\" and \"Death\nof Adonis,\" their record lost during the scuffle and confusion of the\nRevolution, for long hung side by side as pictures by Lemoyne, until,\nbeing cleaned about 1860, Boucher's initials were discovered upon\nthem, and, contemporary engravings being hunted up, still further\nproved their origin. But in the Venus that now figures in all his\nworks there is that flesh-painting of the nude, and that rosy touch\nupon the flesh of the female figure, that are a far more certain\nsignature of Boucher's handiwork than any written name.\n\nUnfortunately the Salons were closed during Boucher's earlier years\nuntil he was thirty-four, and the record of his work during these\nyears is difficult to follow; but with his service to Venus his\npersonal career begins, and the stream of his Venus-pieces steadily\nflows from his hands.\n\nHe came to her service rid of all prentice essays in craftsmanship, a\nfinished and consummate artist. He found in his subject a goddess to\nwhom he could devote his great and splendid gifts. He painted her\ndainty body with a radiant delight and a rare colour-sense such as\nFrance had never before seen or uttered. He remains to this day the\nfirst painter of the subtle, delicate, and elusive thing that is\nfemininity; he caught her allure, her charm, as he was to catch the\nfragrance and charm of children and flowers; and he set the statement\nof these things upon canvas as they have never been uttered.\n\nThe whole of his life long, Boucher gave himself up with equal and\npassionate devotion to work and to pleasure--working at his easel\noften twelve hours of his day without losing, to the end when the\nbrush fell from his dead fingers, his blitheness of heart or his\ngenerosity of act, and without weakening the pleasure-loving desires\nof his gadding spirit. Out of his splendid toil he made the means to\nindulge his tastes for pleasure; and the gratifying of his tastes in\nturn renewed and created the ideas that made the subjects of his\nartistry. He brought to all he did a joy in the doing that made of his\nvast labour one long pleasure--of his pleasures a riot of industry. He\nplayed as he toiled, scarce knowing which was play and which toil.\n\nThe gossip of his love-affairs makes no romantic story--they were but\ncommonplace ecstasies with unknown frail women. But hard as he worked\nand lived and played, he found time to get himself married in his\nthirtieth year to pretty seventeen-year-old Marie Jeanne Buseau, a\nlittle Parisian--and for love of her, so far as he understood the\nbusiness; for she brought him no dowry.\n\nThe young couple settled down for the next ten years in the Rue\nSaint-Thomas-du-Louvre. Here Boucher lived through his thirties.\n\nMadame was a pretty creature, if we had but Latour's pastel portrait\nalone to prove it. But the pretty features were the crown to as pretty\na body, for she sat often to her lord; and it is clear from his\ncorrespondence with a friend, Bachaumont, that she is the Psyche of\nhis illustrated fable--and Psyche runs much to the Altogether.\n\nMarriage, however, was not likely to imprison Boucher's gadding eyes;\nand it did not. Madame Boucher seems to have had as frail a heart, and\navoided strife by amusing herself, amongst others, with the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who, to gain access to the lady,\ncommissioned Boucher to do the Watteau-like illustrations to\nAcajou--a dull affair. Boucher's pretty wife, herself no mean\nartist, worked in his studio, and painted several smaller canvases\nafter his pictures, gaining some fame as a miniaturist and engraver.\n\nNor did Marriage turn Boucher from his art. Two years were gone by\nsince his nomination to the Academy; he had now to paint the formal\nHistorical Picture and present it in order to take his seat as\nAcademician; and it was in this his thirtieth year that he painted and\nwon his academic rank with the \"Renauld et Armide\" now at the Louvre.\n\nHere he sufficiently subordinated his own style to the academic to\nensure success; and the work was hailed by Academicians and critics,\nincluding Diderot, with enthusiasm. But even here we have his cupids\npeeping round the mythologic event; and Armide herself has pretty\nFrench lips that knew no Greek.\n\nOnce secure of his position, he straightway flung the last remnants of\nthe academic style out of his studio door; and it is a grim comment on\ncriticism that it was just exactly in proportion as he developed his\nown personal genius and uttered the France of his day, that he was\nattacked; whilst the stilted things that he knew were third-rate, and\nwhich he wholly rejected from henceforth, were exactly the things that\nwere praised!\n\nHis election to the Academy, and the enthusiasm over the picture that\nwon him his seat thereat, brought his name before the young king; the\nfollowing year he received his first order from the Court whose\npainter he was destined to become. The decorations in the queen's\napartments were gloomy and had grown black; and he painted in their\nstead the \"Charity,\" \"Abundance,\" \"Fidelity,\" and \"Prudence\" still\nthere to be seen. Indeed, with his gay vision, his pretty habit of\nculling only the flowers from the garden of life, and his quickness to\nset down the pleasing thing in every prospect, Boucher was the\ndestined painter of a Court weary of pomposity and the pose of the\nmock-heroic, and which was wholly giving itself up to pleasure and the\nelegances.\n\nBut neither his new dignity of Academician nor the royal favour, kept\nhim from the bookshops; and he illustrated, with rare beauty and a\ncharm worthy of Watteau, the great edition of the Works of Moli\u00e8re\nin his thirty-first year. It is true that he made as free with\nMoli\u00e8re's world as with the Gods of Olympus; he peoples the plays with\ncharacters of his own day, arrayed in the dress and habit of that day,\nand moving in surroundings that he saw about him.\n\n\nLE MONDE QUI S'AMUSE\n\n\nThe Homely had come upon the town out of Holland, painted with most\nconsummate artistry by Chardin, and was soon in the vogue. Boucher had\na quick eye for the mode. And he straightway set himself to the\npainting of \"La Belle Cuisini\u00e8re.\" Still-life and homely subjects need\nan accuracy of realism and a Dutch sense of these things, a sense of\nsincerity and an appreciation of the dignity of the work-a-day life of\nthe people, in which Boucher was wholly lacking. Above all, it calls\nfor a sense of \"character,\" which, in Boucher, was always weak. It was\na sneer against him that his very broomsticks called for pompons and\nribbons--and there was more than a little truth in the spite. He is\nmore concerned with the accident of the kissing of a kitchen-maid than\nwith the kitchen's habit. He cannot even peep into a scullery without\ndragging in Venus by the skirts, and tricking her out in a\nproperty-wardrobe of a scullery-wench, in which the girl is clearly\nbut acting the part.\n\nHowever, these passing vogues and experiments in different methods\nwere only gay asides--he was working the while upon his own subjects;\nand, to the display by its several members ordered by the Academy, he\nsent four little paintings of fauns and cupids which won him the\nhonour of election as deputy-professor. His brain and hand were very\nbusy, and he turns from one thing to another with amazing facility,\nbringing distinction to all that he does.\n\nBut he painted about this time two pictures of infants, \"L'Amour\nOiseleur\" and \"L'Amour Moissonneur,\" which were the beginning of that\nhost of cupids that he let fly from his studio; they frolic across his\ncanvases and join the retinue of Venus, peeping out from clouds, over\nwaves, round curtains, painted with a perfection that has never been\nsurpassed in the portrayal of infants. He painted their round limbs,\ntheir lusty life, their delightful awkwardnesses, their jolly fat\ngrace, their na\u00efve surprise at life and glory in it, as they had never\nbeen painted before, and have never been painted since.\n\nHe also gave forth in this his thirty-third year a \"Pastoral\" and a\n\"Shepherd and Shepherdess in Conversation,\" with sheep about them and\nin a pleasant landscape, which were his first essays in the style that\nhe created and which made him famous.\n\nHis friend Meissonnier, the inventor of the rococo, stood godfather to\nBoucher's first-born son in the May of 1736.\n\nFrom the very beginning Boucher seems to have been engraved. And these\nengravings, done by the best gravers of his day, greatly extended his\nreputation and popularised him; he fully realised the value of the\nadvertisement as well as his profits from it. Before his thirty-third\nyear was run out he published his well-known \"Cries of Paris.\"\n\nBoucher's description of them, \"studies from the low classes,\" holds\nthe key to that something of failure to realise the dramatic verities\nthat is over all; it gives also the attitude of the France that he\nknew towards the France that he did not, and could not understand. He\ncreated that dainty, pleasant atmosphere that comes floating up to the\nwindows on a fresh morning in Paris from the musical cries of\nthe street vendors; but of the deeper significance of the\nstreet-sellers--of the miserable accent in their life, of their weary\ntoil, of the dignity of their labour--he knew nothing; his brush could\nnot refrain from making elegance and fine manners peep from behind the\nstreet-porter's fustian or the milkmaid's skirt.\n\nBut his thirty-third year was to contain a more far-reaching\nsignificance even than the creation of his cupid-pieces and pastorals.\n\nThe \"Cries of Paris\" were scarce printed when Boucher's illustration\nto \"Don Quixote\" appeared--\"Sancho pursued by the servants of the\nDuke.\" This design was to have far-reaching results that Boucher\nlittle suspected.\n\nThe painter Oudry had been called to the conduct of the great tapestry\nlooms at Beauvais a couple of years before; and in his efforts to\nfurnish the looms with good designs, he now called Boucher to his aid,\nwhose original and fresh style, colour, and arrangement, together with\nhis personal vision, and the enthusiasm and zeal with which he threw\nhimself into the work, at once increased the reputation and the\nproducts of the famous looms. This large designing for the tapestries\nwas, in return, of immense value to the development of the genius of\nthe man, enlarging his breadth of style and giving scope to that great\ndecorative sense that was his superb gift. Thenceforth he was destined\nto play a supreme part in the history of the world-famed factories. He\nnow produced painting after painting for the Beauvais looms.\n\nLife is now one long triumph for Boucher, only disturbed in this year\nby the sad news of the suicide of his old master, Lemoyne. It was in\nthis, Boucher's thirty-fourth year, that the Salon was opened for the\nfirst time since Boucher's infancy, and he contributed several\ncanvases to it.\n\nRigaud, the old Academician, now close upon eighty, straggling through\nthe great galleries, might well blink and gasp at the change that had\ncome over French art since he last exhibited there, thirty-three years\ngone by; but his scoffs and regrets held no terrors for the younger\nAcademicians gathered about. He stood in a new world. A new generation\nwas in possession. The grand manner, the severe etiquette, formal\nmock-heroics, and solemn pomposity of Louis the Fourteenth were\nvanished, and the Agreeable and the Pleasant Make-Believe of Louis the\nFifteenth reigned in their stead. Old Rigaud might blink indeed! Just\nas the imposing and stilted etiquette of the reception-room had given\nplace to the easy manners and airy etiquette of the dainty boudoir, so\nhad light chatter and gay wit and the quick repartee usurped the heavy\nsplendours of a consequential age. France, weary of an eternal pose of\nthe grand manner, was seeking change in joyousness and amusement.\n\nGallantry and gaiety were become the object of the ambition of a\ndandified and elegant day. France became a coquette; dressed herself\nas a porcelain shepherdess; and with beribboned crook and sheep,\nseeking pleasant prospects to stroll through, gave herself to\ndalliance--her powder-puff and patch-box and fan a serious part of her\nunseriousness.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE CH\u00c2TEAUROUX\n\n\nAt thirty-five Boucher has arrived. He is in the vogue; in favour at\nCourt--as well as in the fashion. In his three years from taking his\nseat at the Academy to the opening of the first Salon he has created a\nnew and original style--his cupid pieces, his pastorals, his\nVenus-pieces, his tapestry. Boucher's kingdom lay in the realm of the\ndecorative painter--and he has found it. Torn from the surroundings\nfor which he designed them, as part and parcel of the general scheme,\nhis pictures are as out of place as an Italian altarpiece in an\nEnglish dining-room, yet they suffer less. Several may still be seen,\nas he set them up in frames of his own planning, as overdoors in the\npalace of the Soubise, now given up to the national archives.\n\nThe ghost of the Prince of Soubise, who commissioned them, may haunt\nhis palace, but his kin know the place no longer. The overdoors\nwrought by Boucher's skill look down now on the nation's collection of\nhistoric documents. The \"Three Graces enchaining Love,\" the fine\npastoral of \"The Cage,\" and the pastoral of the \"Shepherd placing a\nRose in his Shepherdess's Hair,\" were to see a mightier change than\nthe usurpation of Louis the Fourteenth's pompous age by the elegant\nyears of Louis the Fifteenth. But this was not as yet. Here at least\nwe see Boucher's art rid of all outside influences, and at the full\ntide of creation; here we have the inimitable lightness of touch, the\nfigures and landscape bathed in the airy volume of atmosphere.\n\nHe seems at this time to have played with pastel, due probably to his\nfriendship with Latour, who sent a portrait of Boucher's wife to this\nSalon. Boucher showed in the use of chalks the artistry and skill that\nwere always at his command.\n\nHe also was putting to its full use his innate sense of landscape,\nraising to high achievement that astonishing balance of landscape and\nfigures in his design--a balance that has never been surpassed; his\nfigures never override his landscape; his landscape never overpowers\nhis figures. His earnest counsels to his pupils and his constant\ndeploring of the lack of the landscape art in France prove the great\nstress he laid upon it.\n\nThe designing of a frontispiece for the catalogue of a personal\nfriend, one Gersaint, a merchant of oriental wares, started Boucher in\nhis thirty-third year upon that series of Chinese pictures and\ntapestries known as the \"Chinoiseries,\" in which he frittered away\nonly too many precious hours, for they were received with great favour\nby the public. The paintings of Chinese subjects designed for the\nlooms of Beauvais are still to be seen at Besan\u00e7on.\n\nBut busy as were his brain and hand in the exercise of his wide and\nversatile gifts, pouring out \"Chinoiseries,\" illustrations for books,\ntapestries on a large scale, landscapes, models for the gilt bronze\ndecorations of porcelain vases, scheming handsome frames for his\npictures, designing furniture and fans--Boucher was true, above all,\n\"to his goddess,\" and painted the famed \"Birth of Venus,\" which,\nthanks to the Swedish Ambassador's fondness for Madame Boucher, now\nhangs at Stockholm; our amorous Count de Tessin, to be just, seems to\nhave had a rare flair for the artistic--besides artist's wives. It was\non the 15th of April in 1742, the last year of his thirties, that the\nRoyal favour was marked by the grant of a pension of 400 livres\n(double florins) to Boucher with promise of early benefits to follow.\n\nTwo years afterwards it was raised to 600 livres.\n\nThis was the year that he painted the beautiful canvas of \"Diana\nleaving the Bath with one of her Companions,\" now at the Louvre. It\nwas also the year that saw his landscape, the \"Hamlet of Iss\u00e9\" at the\nSalon. This \"Hameau d'Iss\u00e9\" was to be enlarged for the Opera, proving\nhim to be decorator there, where he was arranging waterfalls,\ncascades, and the rest of the pretty business, without staying his\nhand from his art.\n\nAt forty Boucher has come into his kingdom. The ten years of these\nforties were to be a vast triumph for him. He was to produce\nmasterpiece after masterpiece. His art had caught the taste of the\nday. He was at the height of his powers. He had done great things--he\nwas to do greater. During these ten years of his forties he poured\nforth vivid and glowing works of sustained power and originality.\n\nWe have a picture of him as he was in the flesh at this time--the\npastel portrait by Lundberg, now at the Louvre--a gay, somewhat\ndissipated, handsomely dressed dandy of the time, smiling out of his\ncareless day, the debonnair man of fashion, the laughing eyes showing\nsigns of the night carousals, which were the rest from the prodigious\ntoil of this vital and forthright spirit.\n\nIt was in this our artist's fortieth year that the gifted old Cardinal\nFleury, who had guided the fortunes of France with rare skill, died,\nbroken by his ninety years and the blunders of the disastrous war that\nhe had so strenuously opposed; and Louis, essaying the strut of\nkingship, became king by act. His indolent character, unequal to the\nmighty business, his indeterminate will fretted by the set of\nquarrelling and intriguing rogues that he gathered about him as his\nministers, he fell into the habit that became his thenceforth, the\nonly thing to which he paid the tribute of constancy--he ruled France\nfrom behind pretty petticoats. He had early shown the adulterous blood\nof his great-grandfather; two, if not three, of five sisters of the\nnoble and historic house of De Nesle had yielded to his gadding fancy;\nthe youngest now ousted her sister De Mailly from the king's favour,\nwas publicly acknowledged as the king's mistress, and became Duchess\nof Ch\u00e2teauroux. Boucher painted her handsome being as a shepherdess in\none of his pastorals. She was no ordinary toy of a king. A woman of\ntalent, with hot ambitions for the king's majesty, fired with the\npride of race of the old French noblesse, it was during her short\nyears of ascendancy over the king that he roused from his body's\ntorpor and made an effort to reach the dignity and eminence befitting\nto the lord of a great and gallant people. He stepped forth awhile\nfrom his drunken bouts and manifold mean adulteries, and set himself\nat the head of the army in Flanders, and strutted it as conqueror.\n\nPoor Ch\u00e2teauroux only got the hate of the people for reward, Louis the\nhonours; for the people resented the public dishonour of her state.\n\nPower she found to be a dead-sea apple in her pretty mouth. The glory\nof it all, the splendours, were not the easily won delights for which\nshe had looked. She had to fight a duel, that never ended, with the\nking's witty, crafty, and scurrilous Prime Minister, the notorious\nMaurepas--and Maurepas willed that no woman should ever come between\nhim and the king--Maurepas who knew no mercy, no decency, no chivalry,\nno scruple. At Ch\u00e2teauroux's urging, Louis placed himself at the\nhead of the army; and France went near mad with joy that she had\nagain found a king. Crafty Maurepas urged on the business; the\nCh\u00e2teauroux suddenly realised his cunning glee--it separated her from\nthe king.\n\nOut of the whirl of things Boucher's fortune was ripening, little as\nhe might suspect it.\n\nHe was painting masterpieces that make his name live. To his fortieth\nyear belong the famed \"Birth of Venus,\" the \"Venus leaving the Bath,\"\nthe \"Muse Clio,\" the \"Muse Melpomene,\" and the three well-known\npastorals now at the Louvre--\"The Sleeping Shepherdess,\" the \"Nest,\"\n\n\nand the \"Shepherd and Shepherdesses.\" Of the many famous Venus-pieces\nthat his hand painted during these years it is not easy to write the\nlist. But having signed the \"Marriage of Love and Psyche\" at\nforty-one, he turned his experimental hand to the homely, realistic\nDutch style that was having a wide vogue, and painted the\n\"Dejeuner\"--a family of the prosperous class of the day at\nbreakfast--showing with rare charm the surroundings and home life of\nthe well-to-do of his time.\n\nAll goes well with Boucher. He changes into better quarters in the Rue\nde Grenelle-Saint-Honor\u00e9, where he lived for the next five years,\nuntil 1749; but his eyes are fixed upon a studio and apartments at\nthe old palace of the Louvre, though the hard intriguing of his\npowerful friends at Court on his behalf failed for some time. He had,\nindeed, to make another move before he arrived at his longed-for goal.\n\nPensions Boucher, like others, had found to be somewhat empty affairs;\nbut rooms at the Louvre were a solid possession eagerly sought after\nby the artists.\n\nIn this year of 1744 Boucher created a new fashion at the annual Salon\nby sending studies and sketches instead of finished pictures; and it\nset a value upon such things not before realised by artists, for\nsuccess was instant and loud.\n\nTowards the end of the next, Boucher's forty-second year, the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who was to take his leave of Paris,\ncommissioned four pictures to represent the day of a woman of fashion,\nand to be entitled \"Morning,\" \"Midday,\" \"Evening,\" and \"Night.\"\n\nBoucher painted one of these for him, now known as the \"Marchande de\nModes.\" The others were painted later, and all had a wide vogue as\nengravings. The correspondence has interest since it reveals Boucher's\nbusiness habits; he was paid for a picture on its delivery, and for\neach of these he was to receive 600 livres (double florins or\ndollars)--about a hundred and twenty pounds.\n\nIn an official document of the Director of Buildings to the king (or\nMinister of Fine Art, as we should say), written in this year of 1745,\nBoucher being forty-two, is a \"list of the best painters,\" in which\nBoucher is singled out for distinction as \"an historic painter, living\nin the Rue de Grenelle-Saint-Honor\u00e9, opposite the Rue des Deux-Ecus,\npupil of Lemoyne, excelling also in landscape, grotesques, and\nornaments in the manner of Watteau; and equally skilled in painting\nflowers, fruit, architecture, and subjects of gallantry and of\nfashion.\"\n\nNot so bad for dry officialdom; the critics could learn a lesson. For\nhe was nothing less. What indeed does he not do? and wondrous well!\nthis painter of the age.\n\nAnd the mighty rush of events is about to sweep him into further\nprominence; the very things which he probably passed by with a gay\nshrug are to enrich him, to help him to his highest fulfilment.\n\nPoor Ch\u00e2teauroux saw that she must lose the king's gadding favour in\nthe conflict with Maurepas unless she joined her lord, now with the\narmy. She realised full well that she had created the new Louis of\nAmbition--that her going must bring the people's hate to her. But she\ndared not lose the king. And she went. Maurepas had overdone his\njibings. The indiscretion at once rang through the land; became the\njest of the army--and Maurepas was not far from the bottom of the\nbusiness. The discreet indiscretion of covered ways between the king's\nlodgings and hers only added to the mockeries, and increased the\npeople's hate against, of course, the Ch\u00e2teauroux. Then upon a day in\nAugust the small-pox seized Louis at Metz; poor Ch\u00e2teauroux fought for\npossession of the king in the sick room, until his fear of\ndeath--Louis' sole piety--sent her packing--shrinking back in the\nhired carriage at each halting-place for change of horses, lest she\nshould be seen and torn from her place and destroyed by the populace.\n\nBut Louis recovered; Paris rang with bells at joy on his recovery, and\nhe entered the city amidst mad enthusiasm, hailed as The Well-Beloved.\n\nHe sent for the Ch\u00e2teauroux to find her dying, Maurepas having to\ndeliver the message of recall. She died suddenly and in great agony,\nswearing that Maurepas had poisoned her--died in the arms of her poor\ndiscarded sister, the De Mailly.\n\nBut this year of 1745 Boucher hears a mightier scandal that is to mean\nvast things to all France--and not least of all to Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE POMPADOUR\n\n\nA young bride had become the gossip of the rich merchant society of\nParis--that class that was ousting the old noblesse from power. She\nwas a beautiful, a remarkable woman; her wit was repeated in the\ndrawing-rooms, she had all the accomplishments; her charming\nname--Madame Lenormant d'Etioles.\n\nDraw aside the curtains of the past and we discover our little Jeanne\nPoisson--grown into this exquisite creature. It has come about in\nstrange fashion enough. The father--a scandalous fellow--having\nfingered the commissariat moneys in ugly ways to his own use, had been\nbanished for the ugly business. Nor is Jeanne's mother any better than\nshe should be; and the wags wink knowingly at the handsome and rich\nman of fashion, Monsieur Lenormant de Tournehem, who has been the\nfavoured gallant during the absence of the light-fingered Poisson.\n\nAnd, of a truth, Lenormant de Tournehem takes astonishing interest in\nthe little Jeanne--watching over her up-growing and giving her the\nbest of education at the convent, where she wins all hearts, and is\nknown as \"the little queen.\" The truth spoken with wondrous prophecy,\nif unthinkingly, as we shall see. Complacent Poisson came home, and\ntook the rich and fashionable, bland and smiling Lenormant de\nTournehem to his arms. Has he not wealth and estates? therefore as\nexcellent a friend for Poisson as for Madame Poisson. The girl Jeanne\nleaves the convent to be taught the accomplishments by the supreme\nmasters of France, the wits foregather at Madame Poisson's, and the\nbrilliant Jeanne is soon mistress of the arts--coquetry not least of\nall; has also the most exquisite taste in dress. Under all is a heart\ncold as steel; calculating as the higher mathematics. She has but one\nhindrance to ambition--her mean birth. Lenormant de Tournehem rids her\neven of this slur by making his nephew, Lenormant d'Etioles, marry\nher, giving the young couple half his fortune for dowry, and the\npromise of the rest when he dies--also he grants him a splendid\ntown-house, as splendid a country seat. And consequential\nself-respecting little Lenormant d'Etioles is lord of Etioles, amongst\nother seignories. So Jane Fish appears as Madame Lenormant d'Etioles,\nseductive, beautiful, accomplished, to whose house repair the new\nphilosophy, the wits, and artists. She has a certain sense of virtue;\nindeed openly vows that no one but the king shall ever come between\nher and her lord. But, deep in her heart, she has harboured a fierce\nambition--that the king shall help her to keep her bond. She puts\nforth all her gifts, all her powers, to win to the strange goal;\nconfides it to her worldly mother and \"uncle,\" Lenormant de Tournehem;\nfinds keen allies therein to the reaching of that strange goal. The\ndeath of the Ch\u00e2teauroux clears the way. At a masked ball the king is\nintrigued as to the personality of a beautiful woman who plagues him\nwith her art; he orders the unmasking. Madame Lenormant d'Etioles\nstands revealed, drops her handkerchief as by accident; the whisper\nruns through the Court that \"the handkerchief has been thrown!\" The\nking stoops and picks it up. A few evenings later she is smuggled into\nthe \"private apartments.\" She goes again a month later; in the morning\nis seized with sudden terror--she daren't go back to her angry lord\nlest he do her grievous harm; he will have missed her. The king is\ntouched; allows her to hide from henceforth in the secret apartments;\npromises the beautiful creature a lodging, her husband's banishment,\nand early acknowledgment as titular mistress--before the whole Court\nat Easter, says the pious Great One. But he has to join the army to\nplay the Conqueror at Fontenoy; and it is later in the year\n(September) before Madame d'Etioles is presented to the Court in a\nvast company and proceeds to the queen's apartments to kiss hands on\nappointment. Thus was Jeanne Poisson raised to the great aristocracy\nof France in her twenty-third year as Marquise de Pompadour.\n\nBoucher had been one of the brilliant group of artists of the\nd'Etioles' circle. That the Pompadour's influence had much effect upon\nhis position at Court for a year or two is unlikely; for she had to\nfight for possession of the king day and night, as the Ch\u00e2teauroux\nhad done, against the queen's party and the unscrupulous enmity of\nMaurepas. To set down Boucher's favour at Court to her is ridiculous.\n\nHe was painting for the queen's apartments at thirty-one when the\nPompadour was a school-girl of twelve. But in the year following her\nrise to power, Boucher painted four pictures for the large room of the\nDauphin, which were \"placed elsewhere\"; and, the year after that, he\nwas at work upon two pictures for the bedroom of the king at the\ncastle of Marly. It is likely enough that the Pompadour directed this\norder. She had almost immediately secured the office of the\nDirector-General of Buildings, which covered the direction of the\nroyal art treasures, for \"uncle\" Lenormant de Tournehem, who was also\na friend of the artist. And from this year it is significant that\nBoucher paints no more for the opposing camp of the Queen and Dauphin.\n\nHe was now giving all his strength to the \"Rape of Europa\" that he\npainted for the competition ordered by the Academy at the command of\nLenormant de Tournehem in the king's name, in which ten chosen\nAcademicians were to paint subjects in their own style for six prizes\nand a gold medal, to be awarded in secret vote by the competing\nartists themselves. Boucher won, by his amiable nature, the good-will\nof them all by proposing that they should so arrange as to share the\nprizes equally, and thus prevent any sense of soreness inevitable in\nthe losers.\n\nBut greatly as he won the good-fellowship of his fellow-artists by it,\nthis picture caused a murmur to rise amongst the critics who,\naforetime loud in his praise, now began to complain of his \"abuse of\nrose tints\" in the painting of the female nude. The fact was that\nDiderot and the men of the New Philosophy were turning their eyes to\nthe whole foundations upon which France was built, art as well as\nsociety, and were beginning to demand of art \"grandeur and morality in\nits subjects.\" They were soon to be clamouring for \"the statement of a\ngreat maxim, a lesson for the spectator.\" Diderot, with bull-like\ncourage, picked out the greatest, and turned upon Boucher, blaming him\nfor triviality.\n\nThe nations, weary of war, concluded the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in\nthe October of 1748. No sooner was peace concluded than Louis\nrelapsed into his old habit of dandified indolence and profligate\nease; and, putting from him his duties as the lord of a great people,\nhe gave himself up to shameless intrigues. He allowed the Pompadour to\nusurp his magnificence and to rule over the land. He yielded himself\nutterly, if sometimes sulkily, to her domination; and for sixteen\nyears she was the most powerful person at Court, the greatest force in\nthe state--making and unmaking ministers, disposing of office,\nhonours, titles, pensions. All political affairs were discussed and\narranged under her guidance; ministers, ambassadors, generals\ntransacted their business in her stately boudoirs; the whole patronage\nof the sovereign was dispensed by her pretty hands; the prizes of the\nChurch, of the army, of the magistracy could be obtained solely\nthrough her favour and good-will. Her energy must have been\nprodigious. Possessed of extraordinary talents and exquisite tastes,\nshe gave full rein to them, and it was in the indulgence of her better\nqualities that Destiny brought Boucher into the friendship of this\nwonderful woman. She became not only his patron but his pupil,\nengraving several of his designs.\n\nBut this, her sovereignty over the king, easy and light in its outward\nseeming, was a haggard nightmare to the calculating woman who had so\nlonged for it. She knew no single hour's rest from the night she won\nto the king's bed. She had to fight her enemies, secret and open, for\npossession of the king's will, day and night; and she fought--with\nrare courage. She won by consummate skill and unending pluck. She made\nherself an essential part of the king's freedom from care. The Court\nparty fought her for power with constant vigilance. Maurepas brought\nall his unscrupulous art, all his ironic mimicry, all his vile jibes\nand unchivalrous hatred to bear against her. He had made himself a\nnecessity to the king; and he never slept away a chance of injuring\nher. He knew no mercy, no nobility, no pity. He made her the detested\nobject of the people. With his own hands he penned the witty verses\nand epigrams that were sung and flung about the streets of Paris.\n\nBut she had an enemy more subtle than any at the Court--hour by hour\nshe had to dispute the king with the king's boredom. And it was in the\neffort to do so that she created her celebrated theatre in the\nprivate apartments, calling Boucher and others to her aid in the doing\nof it. Here the noblest of France vied with each other to obtain the\nsmallest part to play, an instrument in its orchestra, an invitation\nto its performances.\n\nBoucher left the Opera to become its decorator in 1748, and did not\nreturn until her death. For her, he also decorated her beautiful rooms\nat Bellevue. She bought at high prices many of his greatest\nmasterpieces.\n\nThe Pompadour's power so greatly increased that she openly took\ncommand of the king's will; dared and succeeded in getting his\nfavourite Maurepas banished; and herself took to the use of the kingly\n\"we.\" Her rascally father was created Lord of Marigny; her brother,\nwhom the king liked well and called \"little brother,\" was created\nMarquis de Vandi\u00e8res; her only child, Alexandrine, signed her name as\na princess of the blood royal, and would have been married to the\nblood royal had she not caught the small-pox and died. She amassed a\nprivate fortune, castles, and estates such as no mistress had dreamed\nof; and into them she poured art treasures that cost the nation\nthirty-six millions of money. She created the porcelain factory of\nS\u00e8vres, kept keen watch over the Gobelins looms, and founded the great\nMilitary School of St. Cyr amidst work that would have kept several\nstatesmen busy, and of deadly intrigues at Court that would have\nbroken the spirit of many a brilliant man.\n\nIt was in her hectic desire to keep the king from being bored that she\nstooped, and made Boucher stoop, to the employment of his high\nartistry in the painting of a series of indecent pictures wherewith to\ntickle the jaded desires of Boredom, and thereby gave rise to the\nwidespread impression that Boucher's art was ever infected by base\ndesign. But Boucher was, at his very worst, but a healthy animal; and\neven in these secret works for the king he did not reach so low as did\nmany an artist of more pious memory who painted with no excuse but his\nown pleasure.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the Pompadour has been blamed too much for this\nevil act, and too much forgotten for her splendid patronage of the man\nwho, under it and during these great years of his forties, produced a\nseries of masterpieces that place him in the foremost rank of the\npainters of his century. It is impossible to reckon the number of the\npastorals and Venus-pieces that his master-hand painted and loved to\npaint, during these the supreme years of his genius. It is significant\nthat they were painted during the years that saw the Pompadour in\nsupreme power.\n\nBoucher was so firmly established in 1750, his forty-seventh year,\nthat he moved into a new house in the Rue Richelieu, near the Palais\nRoyal. Disappointed in not receiving a studio and apartments at the\nLouvre, he was allowed to use a studio in the king's library. He was\nnow making money so easily that he was able to collect pictures and\nprecious stones and the gaily coloured curiosities that appealed to\nhis tastes.\n\nThe critics were becoming more and more censorious; and one of them\nhits true with the comment that in his pastorals his shepherdesses\nlook as if they had stepped over from the Opera and would soon be off\nagain thereto.\n\nIn his forty-eighth year Boucher's art was at its most luminous\nstage--his atmosphere clear and subtle and exquisitely rendered; his\nyellows golden; his whites satin-like and silvery; his flesh-tones\nupon the nude bodies of his goddesses unsurpassed by previous art. The\nbeauty of it all was not to last much longer.\n\nLenormant de Tournehem died suddenly in the November of 1751; the\nPompadour's brother, Abel Poisson de Vandi\u00e8res, was appointed\nDirector-General in his stead at the age of twenty-five--and soon\nafterwards, on the death of his father, created Marquis de Marigny--a\nshy, handsome youth, a gentleman and an honourable fellow, whom the\nking liked well, and against whom his sister's sole complaint was that\nhe lacked the brazen effrontery of the courtiers of the day. No man\ndid more for the advancement of the art of his time. A pension of a\nthousand livres falling vacant, the young fellow secured it for\nBoucher; and almost immediately afterwards, a studio becoming vacant\nat the Louvre owing to the death of Coypel, first painter to the king,\nBoucher came to his coveted home, eagerly moving in with his family as\nsoon as its wretched state could be put into repair.\n\nThe decoration of the new wing to the palace at Fontainebleau brought\nthe commission for the painting of the ceiling and the principal\npicture in the Council Chamber to Boucher, who had already decorated\nthe Dining-Room. This was the period of his painting the \"Rising\" and\nthe \"Setting of the Sun\" for the Pompadour, now in the Watteau\ncollection, two canvases that were always favourites with the painter,\nbitterly as they were assailed by the critic Grimm.\n\nHe was turning out so much work that it was impossible to give as much\ncare to his pictures as he ought. For he refused sternly, his life\nlong, to raise his prices; by consequence he had to create a larger\namount of work in order to meet his expenditure. It was about this\ntime that Reynolds, passing through Paris, went to visit him and found\nhim painting on a huge canvas without models or sketches. \"On\nexpressing my surprise,\" writes Reynolds, \"he replied that he had\nconsidered the model as necessary during his youth until he had\ncompleted his study of art, but that he had not used one for a long\ntime past.\"\n\nHe soon had not the time, not only to paint from nature but even to\ngive his pictures the work necessary to complete them. The feverish\nhaste which took possession of him in his frantic endeavour to meet\nthe vast demand for his pictures, and the eager efforts of his\nengravers to satisfy the public call for engravings after his works,\ngave him less and less leisure to joy in their doing. And his eyesight\nbegan to fail. His flesh-tints deepened to a reddish hue; and he\nstands baffled before his work, suspecting his sight, since what every\none cries out upon as being bright vermilion, he only sees as a dull\nearthy colour. Boucher has topped the height of his achievement; he\nhas to \"descend the other side of the hill.\" Boucher begins to grow\nold.\n\nIn Boucher's fifty-first year an ugly intrigue of the queen's party at\nCourt to sap the Pompadour's influence over the king by drawing away\nthe king's affections towards Madame de Choiseul-Romanet, a reckless\nyoung beauty of the Court, brought about a strange alliance. The Count\nde Stainville, one of the Pompadour's bitterest enemies, was shown the\nking's letter of invitation to his young kinswoman; and he, deeply\nwounded in his pride that his kinswoman should have been offered to\nthe king, went to the Pompadour and exposed the plot. A close\nalliance followed; and De Stainville thenceforth became her chief\nguide in affairs of state. It was at her instance that the king called\nhim to be his Prime Minister, raising him to the Duchy of Choiseul--a\nname he made illustrious as one of the greatest Ministers of France.\n\nIn his fifty-second year Boucher was appointed to the directorship of\nthe Gobelins looms, to the huge delight of the weavers and all\nconcerned with the tapestry factory. This was the year of his painting\nthe famous portrait of the Pompadour, to whom he several times paid\nthis \"tribute of immorality.\" For the Gobelins looms he produced many\nhandsome designs; and he was painting with astounding industry. But\nhis hand's skill began to falter. His art shows weariness in his\nsixtieth year, and sickness fell upon him, and held him in servitude\nnow with rare moments of respite. The critics, notoriously Diderot,\nwere now attacking him with shameless virulence. Boucher passed it all\nby; but he felt the change that was taking place in the public taste.\n\nThe ideas of the New Philosophy were infecting public opinion; the Man\nof Feeling had arisen in the land; and France, humiliated in war, and\nresenting the follies and the greed of her shameless privileged class,\nwas openly resenting it and all its works. Choiseul had planted his\nstrength deep in the people's party, and was come near to being its\ngod. His masterly mind had checked Frederick of Prussia to the North;\nand the nations, exhausted by the struggle, signed the Peace of Paris\nin 1763. Choiseul, with France at peace abroad, turned to the blotting\nout of the turbulent order of the Jesuits at home. Their attempt to\nend the Pompadour's relations with the king made this powerful woman\neager to complete his design; the chance was soon to come, and the\nOrder was abolished from France and its vast property seized by the\nstate.\n\nThe Pompadour lived but a short while to enjoy her triumph. Worn out\nby her superhuman activities, assailed by debt, she fell ill of a\nracking cough, dying on the 15th of April, 1764, in her forty-second\nyear, keeping her ascendancy over the king and the supreme power in\nFrance to her last hour. Death found her transacting affairs of state.\n\nLouis, weary of his servitude, had only a heartless epigram to cast\nat the body of the dead woman as she passed to her last resting-place.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE END\n\n\nThe death of the Pompadour robbed Boucher of a friend; but her\nbrother, Marigny, remained faithfully attached to the old artist, and\nseized every chance to honour him. On the death of Carle van Loo,\nBoucher, at sixty-two, was made first painter to the king, with all\nhis pensions and privileges that were consistent with this the supreme\nappointment in the art world.\n\nThere had been serious intention of making Boucher the head of the\nEcole des El\u00e8ves Proteg\u00e9s; he had the art of making himself liked and\nof inspiring the love of the arts. He was very popular with the\nstudents and artists, owing to his kindliness, his eagerness to render\nservice, his readiness to encourage the youngsters or to console them.\n\nWhen the riot took place, provoked by the Academicians by their award\nof the Prix de Rome in 1767, the students insulted the Academicians,\nbut hailed Boucher with enthusiastic applause. The reason was not far\nto seek. When a student came to the old master for advice he did not\n\"play the pontiff,\" and, scorning the false dignity of big phrases, he\ntook the brush in his hand and showed the way out of all difficulties\nby simplehearted example, despising rules, and putting himself out in\norder to make things clear to a young artist.\n\nHowever, the Academicians feared he would be an unorthodox master for\nyouth, and appointed another in his place.\n\nA long and serious illness thwarted his keen energies. Diderot was\ngiving himself up to outrageous violence against him. If the old\npainter exhibited at the Salon, Diderot fiercely assailed his art; if\nhe did not exhibit, Diderot as bitterly assailed him for his\nnegligences. Above all, he attacked Boucher in that he did not paint\nwhat Diderot would have painted--but could not. \"When he paints\ninfants,\" cries Diderot, \"you will not find one employed in a real act\nof life--studying his lesson, reading, writing, stripping hemp.\"\n\nPoor unfortunate infants! for whom Philosophy could find no happier\njoy in life than stripping hemp! Boucher was but an artist. He\npainted his generation as far as he could see it, and, with all his\nfaults and weaknesses, he never debauched his art with foreign and\nalien things that had no part in the nation's life; he painted fair\nFrance into his landscapes, not a make-believe land he did not know\nwith preposterous Greek ruins; and best of all, to his eternal honour,\nhe painted infants glad in their gladness to be alive, with no desire\nto send their happy little bodies to school, with no sickly ambition\nto make them into budding philosophers, with no thought of making them\npose and lie as Men of Feeling. He had no joy in setting their little\nbodies to toil--in making them \"teach a lesson to the spectator,\" in\nmaking them stoop their little shoulders to the \"picking of hemp.\"\n\nHe continued to paint as he had always painted--except that he painted\nless well. The wreath of roses was wilting on a grey head. The blood\njigged less warmly in the frail body. The features showed pallid--the\neyes haggard. The sight failed. The hand alone kept something of its\ncunning.\n\nHe went to Holland with his friend Randon du Boisset, but health\nshrank farther from him. Diderot had near spent his last jibe.\n\nIn 1768, Boucher's sixty-fifth year, the neglected queen went to her\ngrave. The king's grief and contrition and vows to amend his life came\ntoo late, and lasted little longer than the drying of the floods of\ntears over the body of his dead consort. A year later he was become\nthe creature of a pretty woman of the gutters, whom he caused to be\nmarried to the Count du Barry--the infamously famous Madame du Barry.\n\nBut neither the remonstrances of Choiseul with the king against this\nfurther degradation of the throne of France, nor his unconcealed scorn\nof the upstart countess, nor the dangerous enemy he made for himself\nthereby, signified now to Boucher, first painter to the king.\n\nBoucher was failing. His son was a prig and a disappointment. His two\nfavourite pupils, Baudoin and Deshayes, who had married his two girls,\ndied.\n\nTo the Salon of 1769 he sent his \"Caravan of Bohemians.\" It was his\nlast display. He had been going about for some time like a gaunt ghost\nof his former self, afflicted with all the ills inevitable to a life\nfeverishly consumed in work and the pursuit of pleasure.\n\nThey went to his studio at five of the clock one May morning, and\nfound him seated at his easel, before a canvas of Venus, dead, with\nthe paint-filled brush fallen out of his fingers.\n\nSo passed he away on the 30th of May 1770, in his sixty-seventh year.\n\nWhen Boucher died, the generation of which he was the limner was near\ncome to its violent end. The rosy carnivals and gay gallantries of his\nage gave way to the blood-stained romance and fierce tempest of the\nRevolution. The garrets of the old curiosity-shops received the\ndiscarded canvases of the master. His shepherds and shepherdesses were\nput to rout by the Romans of his pupil, citizen David. The old order\nwas brought into contempt and overthrown. And with it, Boucher's art,\nlike much that was gracious and charming and good in the evil thing,\nwent down also, and was overwhelmed for a while.\n\nFor a while only. For just as, out of the blood and terror of the\nRevolution, a real France arose, phnix-wise, from the ruin, and in\nbeing born, whilst putting off the vilenesses of the thing from which\nshe sprang, took on also to herself the gracious and winsome qualities\nthat place her amongst the most fascinating peoples of the ages; so\nBoucher has come into his kingdom again--the most gracious of painters\nthat the years have yielded."

                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n        a. One bed, or folding cot,\n        b. One oil stove,\n        c. One lamp,\n        d. Enough supplies of all kinds sufficient for six months,\n        e. Pots, pans, kettles, etc.\nIt is needless to say that positions in Manila and Iloilo were now at\na premium.\n\nWas it possible that teachers were to be sent to places where even the\nnecessaries of life could not be obtained! Was it possible that many\nwould be sent to places so remote that for six months no fresh\nsupplies could be gotten! A mass meeting was held at once, and a\ncommittee was appointed to send a cablegram to the Associated Press\npetitioning aid from the American people at large. Realizing what\nconsternation would be created throughout the United States by such a\nmessage, two of the teachers leaped into a carriage at the close of\nthe meeting and a few moments later were closeted with the chief\nexecutive of the department. As a result the committee was persuaded\nnot to send the cablegram to the Associated Press until by courtesy it\nhad been sent to the President. Of course, this diplomatic move tided\naffairs over and the teachers who had flatly refused to budge from\nManila now agreed to go on to their stations, being assured that\nwhatever action was best would be taken.\n\nThe day had come when we must separate. We were to enter an untried\nand an unknown field. It was fitting that we have a final joyous\nmeeting, so the best orchestra in the archipelago was engaged and we\n\"chased the hours with flying feet\" until dawn so that whatever might\ncome to us in that unknown future upon which we were entering each\nwould hold in pleasant memory our last evening together.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER III. - A DRAMA IN ACTUAL LIFE.\n\n\nAlmost every one heeded the warning to go to his station forearmed\nwith at least necessaries of life, but, as it had never fallen to the\nlot of the writer to cook, he refused to learn at that late day, so he\ntook no pot, no pan, no kettle, putting his future into the hands of\nan uncertain fate and relying upon the unknown hospitality of the\nFilipino.\n\nBacalod, the capital of the province of Occidental Negros, was our\ndestination. The second morning after leaving Manila, we awoke with\nthe \"Kilpatrick\" lying at anchor in a shallow bay. We were several\nmiles from the shore and nothing in sight indicated that we had\nreached a place of any importance. Late the night before we had been\nawakened by the loud, sharp ringing of the ship's bells, accompanied\nby the reversal of the engines and a general disturbance awaking the\ncrew. So our first impressions on coming on deck were that we had run\naground. But the captain assured us that everything was ship-shape and\nthat this was the nearest point of approach to Capiz, a town of\nconsiderable importance on the island of Panay, where a body of troops\nwas to embark for home. Not even the grass hut of a native was in\nsight. Search as we would, not a sign was seen of a stream flowing\ninto the sea, indicating the probable presence of a town. There was\nnot a sign of life of any kind save one lone column of thin, blue\nsmoke that arose from the side of a mountain miles away. One would\nhave thought that we were explorers of three hundred years ago lying\noff the shore of some unknown land.\n\nAfter breakfast the steam launch, together with all the boats, was\nlowered, and several of us who had determined to miss no opportunity\nto gather information about the islands took our places in the launch\nby the side of the ship's mate, and steamed away across the water with\na long line of boats strung out in the rear. We headed away toward a\ngroup of cocoanut trees, and about an hour later stepped ashore on a\npile of decayed coral rocks that extended some twenty or thirty feet\nout into the water, thus forming the only landing place of a town of\nseveral thousands of people and of considerable commercial importance.\n\nA few moments after we had landed, an army wagon drawn by a\nmagnificent pair of mules came up out of a tropical jungle along a\nnarrow road. We clambered into the wagon and were soon lost in the\ndepths of foliage from which we had just seen the vehicle emerge.\n\nLong waving bamboos with their plumy leafage hung over the road from\neach side, meeting and overlapping in the center until they formed an\narchway so dense that the tropical sun now high in the heavens\npenetrated it only at intervals. At times the wagon sank up to the\nhubs in the soft earth, and the muscles of the mules stood out like\nwhip-cords under the skin as they drew us forward.\n\nAt a sharp turn in the road we came upon the first division of troops\nthat was to embark for home. The look of joy upon their sun-browned\nfaces was inexpressible. Their work was done, and with elastic step\nand smiling faces they saluted us as they passed by. The reign of\nforce was at an end; it was going out with them; the reign of peace\nhad begun; it was coming in with us.\n\nIn the afternoon when we returned from the town the last of the troops\nhad arrived and, as we drove up, the bugle was sounding the call to\nsupper. We noticed native women mingling with the troops and, indeed,\na native woman was in constant attention waiting upon one of the\nsoldiers with whom we ate. Her clothes were clean, her hair was nicely\ncombed, and her general appearance was neat. She seemed to anticipate\nthe slightest wish of the soldier with whom she was. She brought him\nwater to drink, cleaned his plate after the meal and saw that his\nknife, fork, and spoon were put into his haversack.\n\nWe had now finished supper and the launch had returned for the last\nload of troops. The lieutenant in command of the company gave the\norder to \"fall in\"; the men shouldered their rifles and fell into\nline. \"Forward, march!\" called the lieutenant, and the column swept\nforward towards the boats. The women had until now restrained\nthemselves, but, as their husbands marched away never to return, their\nfeelings could no longer be restrained. One young woman of about\neighteen, who was leaning against a rock by the roadside sobbing, when\nher husband passed, leaped up in frenzy of passionate love and caught\nthe rifle from his shoulder. Her first impulse seemed to be to throw\nthe gun away, but suddenly realizing the futility of such an act she\nburst into tears, shouldered the rifle herself and marched on by his\nside. Another woman of more mature age threw her arms around the legs\nof a tall stalwart man, and drew him bodily from the line.\n\nBut the troops marched on and entered the boats. One woman who had\nbeen unnoticed before came down into the shallow water and caught hold\nof our last boat as if to prevent its leaving, while others stood\nmingling their sobs with the sounds of the wavelets as they broke on\nthe sands. As we passed away, an expectant mother, standing in bold\noutline against the twilight sky, threw up her hands in an agony of\ndespair and then sank upon the stones. The curtain had fallen upon a\ndrama in actual life deeper in pathos than any other we had ever seen\nor ever expected to see. Depth of passion, depth of love! Who can\nfathom the human heart?\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. - WHAT THE TEACHERS DID.\n\n\nThere is a remarkable sameness about the towns in the Philippines.\n\nThey all have a large open square about the middle of the town, around\nthree sides of which are Chinese stores, unless one side lies open to\nthe sea, and on the fourth is the great stone ecclesia. The streets\nrun at right angles to one another and divide up the town into\ncreditable squares.\n\nEverybody in the Philippines lives up-stairs, for the ground is so\nsoaked with water during the rainy season that it is a menace to\nhealth to live upon the ground floor. So even the poorest nippa hut\nis built upon stakes four or five feet above the ground.\n\nBacalod is a typical Philippine town. As we landed, a broad open\nsquare was spread out before us. Two sides of the square were lined\nwith two-story houses in which were Chinese stores below and Filipino\nhomes above. On the third side stood the great stone church in whose\nmassive tower the clock was striking the hour of four, while the\nfourth lay open to the sea that had borne us thither.\n\nWe landed, but it was in a method new to us and one not usually\nemployed by the traveling public.\n\nWhen our sail boat ran aground on the sandy bottom a hundred yards or\nmore from the shore, a crowd of Filipino men who were on the beach\nslowly rolled up their pantaloons and waded out to the rescue,--for\nthe money that was in it. The boat's crew elevated their trousers'\nlegs also and slided down into the water. Each of us then straddled\nthe neck of a Filipino standing in the water and was held by ankles to\nbe steadied while our biped mounts proceeded to the shore.\n\nWe were now on the ground and face to face with the situation. To give\nthe reader an idea of the actual conditions met by the first teachers\nwho went to the Islands, the following is copied from the instructions\ngiven us in Manila:\n    1. There shall be two sessions daily of all schools, and the\n    last hour of the morning session shall be devoted solely to\n    instructing the Filipino teachers.\n\n    2. In cases where teachers are sent to a town in which there\n    is no school-house, they are expected to secure the aid of the\n    people and have one built.\n\n    3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is\n    stopped.\n\n    4. All supplies must be kept under lock and key. In towns\n    where there is no case or box to lock the supplies in, and it\n    is also impossible to get the town council to furnish a case,\n    a requisition may be sent to Manila, and, if an appropriation\n    can be secured, one will be made and sent out.\n\nThus it can be easily seen that we were indeed pioneers. In many\nplaces no school-house was to be found, and in some cases it was even\ndifficult to get the town council to provide a case in which to keep\nthe supplies.\n\nThe work of the teachers was, in short; to \"make the English language\nthe basis of instruction in the public schools.\" On our arrival at\nBacalod two schools were found in progress, for some soldiers had been\ndetailed for the work here previous to our coming. One of these was\nfor boys and the other, for girls. Thus the work here had been in a\nmeasure simplified, but complications that had arisen at Talisay, one\nof the largest and richest towns on the island, demanded a change of\nteachers and the writer was assigned to the place as superintendent.\n\nHere an attempt had been made to start a school but it had failed\nignominiously and a system of education was to be put into operation\nfrom the very start.\n\nThe Filipinos are not strong advocates of co-education, so separate\nschools were to be started for the boys and the girls. The one for the\nboys was gotten well in hand before the one for the girls was\nattempted at all.\n\nA few days after reaching the town and securing a home the\npresidente of the town had it publicly announced that the following\nMonday morning at eight o'clock a public school for boys would be\nopened in a building that had been rented for the purpose by the\nmunicipal council. About the middle of the afternoon of the same day a\nman beat a little drum throughout all the streets of the town to call\nthe people out and the town clerk announced both in Spanish and in the\nnative language that this public school would begin at the time and\nplace mentioned above; that instruction would be free to all who came;\nthat the government would furnish all supplies; and that instruction\nwould be given in the English language. A native principal and\nassistants were employed and everything was ready to begin.\n\nThe official report of the result is as follows:\n    Boys' public school of Talisay, Negros, P. I., began November\n    4, 1901. Forty-three boys present at eight o'clock. Forty-one\n    of them knew \"good morning\" and \"good afternoon\" but do not\n    know the distinction between them. Two of them speak simple\n    Spanish. At eight forty-five, eight more, who had been\n    attending an early morning private school, came in together.\n\n    The books they brought were so varied and so different from\n    one another that it seemed impossible to bring any reasonable\n    degree of order out of such a chaos, and so, after struggling\n    vainly for about a week with the problem, the superintendent\n    by one fell stroke removed everything in use and put in a\n    uniform system, and from that day on the English language has\n    been the basis of instruction in the public schools of\n    Talisay. The work was of necessity very slow at first, but by\n    the end of a year two schools were going nicely and a number\n    of the brightest boys and girls had made really excellent\n    progress.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER V. - A \"BAILE.\"\n\n\nNot long after the arrival of our party at Bacalod we received an\ninvitation to a \"baile\" given in our honor by the inhabitants of\nSilay, a town some ten or twelve miles up the northern coast and one\nnoted for its social life. The invitation was accepted with pleasure,\nand about the middle of the afternoon on the day appointed we were\nclad in the immaculate white of the tropics and steaming away up the\ncoast on board a launch sent for our conveyance. Twilight was still\nlingering on the path of day when we anchored just off shore at the\ntown. A row-boat containing the officials of the city came out to meet\nus and, in due season, we were ushered into a spacious drawing-room\nfilled almost to overflowing with the \u00e9lite of the town. The \u00e9lite of\ntowns in the Philippines speak Spanish, and, as only one or two of our\nparty could at that time boast of more than a formal acquaintance with\nthe Castilian tongue, the exchange of ideas that evening between us\nand the Filipinos was of necessity not very rapid.\n\nThe necessity of easy communication between us was rendered somewhat\nless indispensable by the announcement of supper as soon as we were\nrested from our trip. When we had taken our places at the table a\nyoung Filipino about twenty-five years of age arose and gave a lengthy\ntoast to the recent union of the Philippines with the United States.\n\nBut as we Americans were unable to scale the dizzy heights of his\nclimaxes or sink to the depths of his pathos, we forewent the\npleasures of his oratory and turned our attention to the savory odor\nof lamb, chicken, and roast pig that came slyly stealing up our\nnostrils to send us nerve dispatches about the gastronomic delights of\nour not far distant future.\n\nAt last the toast was ended and the world-wide soup ushered in a long\ntrain of things good to eat, served in a style better fitted to the\ndelights of the appetite than to the formalities of dinners, for, as\nsoon as the pleasant task of one dish was completed by any one, the\nnext was served him at once regardless of the progress made by the\nothers at the table.\n\nThe last course was dulce. The new-comers to the Philippines will\nnot be long in making the acquaintance of this dish, and at all\nmeetings, both public and private, where eatables are served, it\nperforms an important part. It is anything sweet, and it may vary all\nthe way from an india-rubber-like black mixture of cocoanut milk and\ndirty sugar to a really toothsome and respectable confection. No\nmatter of what materials a dish is composed, just so long as it is\nsweet, it is dulce.\n\nAfter paying our respects to this last course, we arose from the table\nand entered a great rectangular room from the center of whose ceiling\nhung a large glass chandelier, a mass of shimmering crystals. In the\nchairs around the room were the wealth, the youth, and the beauty of\nthe town.\n\nThe first and also the last number of every Filipino dance of any\nformality is the \"rigodon.\" The dancers are arranged in a square, or\nquadrangle according to the number participating, and are then led\nthrough a tangled maze of figures that so utterly bewilders the novice\nthat he sinks into his chair at the end of the dance wondering how it\nall came to pass.\n\nWe Americans breathed a sigh of relief when the \"rigodon\" ended, and\nmustered fresh courage for social conquests in the waltz that was now\nbreathing forth from the trembling strings. My companion in the first\ndance had been the young lady by whose side I had sat at dinner. But\nit now became necessary to search for another, so I prudently waited\nto see how partners were chosen, and made no mistake when a few\nmoments later I faced one of the most luscious looking se\u00f1oritas on\nthe opposite side of the room and offered her my arm. My eyes must\nhave told the story that my lips could not utter in Spanish, for she\nsmiled upon me sweetly, arose, and put her hand upon my shoulder. My\narm encircled her waist and I began to waltz. Unfortunately my\ncompanion did not follow, but began to hop up and down in a manner\nmost distressing. Supposing the attack to be only temporary, I paused\nand, much to my relief, she soon showed signs of recovery; and in the\ncourse of time she came to a standstill looking up into my face in an\ninquiring sort of way, apparently wondering why St. Vitus had not paid\nhis respects to me also. A second attempt to follow the music met with\nresults similar to the first, and during the third attempt, which\nseemed to be trembling on the verge of a failure, St. Vitus let go my\ncompanion and seized me with such vigor that she, who was small even\nfor a Filipino, was gathered up bodily and taken around the room at\nsuch a pace that her toes touched the floor only at far distant\nintervals.\n\nAt this point my devotion to the shrine of Terpsichore ceased from\nforce of circumstances and I seated myself in one of the most\ncomfortable chairs in sight that I might carry out a previously formed\nplan to study the Filipino somewhat critically as he appears in\nsociety.\n\nThe first thing that impressed me as the dancers passed up and down\nthe room was the flash of diamonds. Nearly every woman in the room had\non a brooch that flashed the colors of the rainbow at every turn.\n\nAlmost all of them wore one or more rings that showed up brilliantly\nunder the chandelier. Many of the men too, especially the young men,\nwore gems that appeared to be exquisite. A closer inspection showed\nthat some of the gems had flaws and others were of a poor color, but\nno one would have denied that, taken as a whole, it was a really\nbeautiful display.\n\nThe dress of the ladies was richly colored. Many of their skirts were\nof silk covered with hand embroidered flowers, and their filmy pina\nwaists and broad collar pieces were rich with needle-work. They all\nwore a kind of heelless velvet slipper, very common as a dress shoe in\nthe Philippines, or high-heeled patent leather shoes with neatly\nfitting black stockings.\n\nThe men were dressed in white coats and white pantaloons or black\ncoats and white pantaloons. White shirts and collars, together with\nall sorts and styles of cravats and low-cut patent leather shoes with\nhighly colored socks completed their dress.\n\nIt was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money;\nthat they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a\ntable loaded with good things was a fact to which all of us were\nenthusiastic witnesses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VI. - A SKETCH OF LIFE IN THE PHILIPPINES.\n\n\nHouse-keeping in the Philippines presents some interesting phases. Our\nclub of American officials decided to run a mess, so we employed a\ncook and a house boy, then each of us provided himself with a personal\nservant, making a total of six servants for four men--it takes about\nthis proportion of servants to live in any sort of comfort in the\nPhilippines--and launched ourselves boldly upon the sea of domestic\neconomy. But there were shoals ahead of us, for the question of\nregulating servants is one of no small importance in the Philippines,\nand one of its most disadvantageous features is the long chain of\ndependents that usually attends it.\n\nWe gave the cooks so much a day with which to buy supplies in the\nlocal market, for our own table, making him render a daily list of\nexpenditures, and a fixed amount besides to purchase rice and fish for\nhimself and the other servants. Of course, if they wished to vary\ntheir diet and get chicken and fresh pork, which could be had at far\ndistant intervals, it was wholly a matter of their option, but the\nallowance was made on the basis of so much rice and fish a day for\neach. This allowance was about fifteen cents a day in Spanish coin per\nservant.\n\nThus far all was well. We had agreed to give the cook eight dollars a\nmonth in Spanish money, thinking that good wages would procure good\nservice, but the visions of affluence that floated before him on such\nfloods of wealth were so alluring that they drew him from the kitchen\nto the cooler veranda. In less than a week he had employed an\nassistant at four dollars a month; in less than another week that\nassistant had employed him an assistant at two dollars a month; in\nless than another week that assistant to the assistant had employed\nhim an assistant at the princely salary of fifty cents a month; and\nfrom fear that the chain of dependents would end only by our having\nthe whole Filipino race attached to our culinary force, we broke up\nhouse-keeping and went boarding again, choosing that as the less of\nthe two evils.\n\nOur house furnishings were almost wholly Philippine. The table ware\nand the food on the table came from the ends of the earth. The knives\nand forks were made in Germany, the plates were manufactured in\nEngland, the glass ware and table cloth, in the United States. The\noatmeal and flour came from the United States also. The butter came\nfrom Australia, the rice from China, the salt from Russia, and the\nother eatables from sources about as various as their separate names.\n\nSwitzerland furnished the condensed milk and Illinois the canned\ncream. Nearly all of the canned fruit bore labels from Spain.\n\nThus it can easily be seen that life in the Philippines, if lived\naccording to American ideals, is dependent upon a highly developed and\nhighly complex commerce. However, the difficulties of transportation\nand the restriction of large stocks of merchandise to Manila and some\nhalf a dozen other towns, make so great a difference between country\nlife and city life that a short comparison of the two will not be out\nof place, and life in Manila may well be taken as being fairly typical\nof the latter.\n\nLife in Manila is pleasant, but expensive. It is pleasant from the\nfact that it is not only the capital but also metropolis of the\narchipelago. Thus the combination of wealth and high official position\nhas given to Manila a society of the highest and most refined type.\n\nThe process of beautifying and improving the city which is constantly\ngoing on bids fair to give us at no distant day a city of which we may\nwell be proud.\n\nBut let him who intends living well in Manila on a small income bid\nfarewell at once to so idylic a dream, for it costs much to live well\nthere. In the city of Manila one can get almost anything he wishes,\nbut it must be paid for at the price it commands. Especially in the\ncase of eatables, this price is by no means small, because to the\nfirst cost of articles must in most cases be added the expense of\ndistant shipment from American, European, or Australian ports, and not\ninfrequently the cost of long refrigeration must also be taken into\nconsideration. But, expensive though it is, it is very pleasant to\nlive there and those who have once enjoyed it often wish again to\nquaff the cup of its delights.\n\nIn strong contrast to this pleasant life is the life of the quiet\nlittle hamlet away in the distant islands. Indeed, the Filipino from\nthe distant town, who by some good fortune has been to Manila, or, by\na coup de main, has studied in one of the Manila colleges, is looked\nup to in a true hero-worshiping attitude by all who either know him or\nhear of his fame. Life in such a place is one long state of harmless\ninactivity. Not a wave of trouble from the great outer world ever\ndisturbs its peaceful repose. One lounges forever in an air of\nindolent ease and extreme aversion to anything approaching what might\nbe called a respectable effort.\n\nOne arises in the morning about the time the sun's first rays silver\nthe top leaves of the cocoanut trees and then stirs around until nine\nor ten o'clock, when it is found expedient to avoid a further exposure\nto the sun. From then until about five o'clock in the afternoon it is\nbest to take things as they come, even though one of those things be a\nFilipino dinner. But then you may have your vehiclo attached to a\nyoung bull with a ring in his nose and go for a drive. If it is the\ndry season you will probably enjoy the drive unless you object to the\nfrequent clouds of dust swept along by the evening wind. If it is in\nthe rainy season your pleasure will depend to a considerable extent\nupon how wet you get; but, whether the season be wet or dry, your\npleasure will be regulated largely by the state of harmony existing\nbetween the driver and the bull.\n\nIn these quiet secluded nooks successive generations of Filipinos are\nborn, reared, grow old and die in an even chain of events broken only\nby the occasional erection of a new grass house on the identical spot\nwhere its predecessors have stood for ages. The son lives in the house\nof his father, cultivates the same few square feet of soil planted in\nedible roots, climbs the same cocoanut trees, follows the same winding\npath down to the stream, pounds rice in the same mortar and with the\nsame stick that his ancestors have used from time unremembered, and,\nin case of illness, curls up on a grass mat in a corner of the room\nuntil he dies or by some good fortune recovers. Beyond this narrow\nhorizon he never looks. So narrow and contracted is the life that the\nlanguages of two towns a few miles apart are so different that one\nwould scarcely recognize them as belonging to the same race of people.\n\nSuch are the two extremes of life in our new far Eastern provinces:\nthe one is active, progressive, and cosmopolitan; the other, inactive,\ndecadent, and narrow; but, whether one enjoys the first or endures the\nsecond, there comes to him after leaving a longing to lounge again in\ntropic airs and listen to the lullaby of the winds among the palms.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VII. - THE FILIPINO AT HOME.\n\n\nAs one enters a Filipino sitting-room for the first time, there is one\nfeature in the arrangement of the furniture that impresses itself upon\nhim at once, and it may be stated without fear of serious\ncontradiction that this same peculiar feature in its arrangement will\ncontinue to face him, as he enters different homes, about as certainly\nas he crosses the threshold.\n\nThe arrangement referred to is that of one large mirror, one settee,\nand some ten or a dozen chairs that appear to have had a certain\norderly affection for one another. The mirror is hung upon one of the\nlarge interior parts of the house about four feet above the floor. The\nwooden houses in the Philippines are built by setting large posts\nupright into the ground, extending into the air from twenty to thirty\nfeet. Cross timbers are fastened to these upright posts about eight or\nten feet above the ground and then not sawed off even with the posts,\nbut allowed to extend beyond them each way. The framework of the house\nis built upon these extending cross timbers, a style of building by\nwhich these large upright posts are left standing out on the inside of\nthe room from one to three feet from the walls. It is on that one of\nthese posts most nearly opposite the door that the mirror always finds\nits place. Immediately beneath the mirror is the settee; and the\nchairs are arranged in two parallel lines facing one another and at\nright angles with the ends of the settee. However odd this arrangement\nmay appear to one when he first enters a Filipino drawing-room, there\nare two things to be said in its favor. In the first place, it places\nyou face to face with the person with whom you are conversing so that\nyou can watch him,--a matter of no small moment in the Philippines. In\nthe next place, it enables you to give one of the young ladies a\nsheep's-eye in the mirror while the others present are left where\nMoses was in our much abused conundrum.\n\nThe size of the residence and the quality of its furnishings depends\nupon the wealth of the owner. But there is so vast a difference\nbetween the mode of life of the highest class and the tao, or lowest\nclass, that it is well to speak of them separately, and the great\nmiddle class of Filipinos can easily be imagined to occupy the\nintervening ground.\n\nThe rich Filipino's house is usually of wood built upon a wall of\nstone or brick from ten to fifteen feet high. The floors are kept\nhighly polished in his hallway, dressing-room, and bed-rooms. There\nare, of course, no fire-places in any of the rooms, but on some\noccasions something is needed to dry the rain-soaked atmosphere, for\neven in the dry season it has been seen to rain for five successive\ndays and nights without the cessation of a moment.\n\nA long chain of dependents is attached to the household of the rich\nFilipino. The master has his special body servant to be present at all\ntimes to do his master's bidding, in short, to be the visible\nmechanism of his master's volition. So, too, the lady of the house has\nher servant woman to do the slightest bidding of her ladyship. Then\nthere is the cook who is almost invariably a man, a house boy or two,\nand the coachman. These functionaries, with their assistants and\nassistants to the assistants, together with a servant or two for the\nexclusive service of the children, complete the economic household.\n\nSuch a family has an abundance of rice and wheat bread, also of\nchicken and fish with occasional fresh beef. They have also a good\ndeal of dulce. They regularly serve wine and frequently serve beer\non their tables.\n\nIn strong contrast with this mode of life is that of the tao. His\ndiet consists almost wholly of rice and small uncleaned fish boiled\ntogether. As a rule knife, fork, plate, and spoon find no place in his\nhousehold. The rice and fish are boiled in a pot and then allowed to\ncool in the same vessel or poured out to cool in a large earthen or\nwooden bowl. Then Mr. Tao together with Mrs. Tao and all the young\nTaos squat on their heels around the mixture and satisfy that\nintangible thing called the appetite. They do not use chop sticks as\nthe Chinese do, but the rice and fish are caught in a hollow formed by\nthe first three fingers of the right hand. The thumb is then placed\nbehind the mass. It is raised up and poised before the mouth, with a\nskill coming from the evolution of ages, when a contraction of the\nmuscles of the thumb throws the mass into the mouth with a skill that\nis marvelous to any but a Filipino. To judge from the most reliable\ninformation, the poorest class do not have an abundance of food,\nalthough it would seem that such a condition of things would be\nwell-nigh impossible. However, in a census of one hundred school\nchildren there were found six boys and four girls who declared that\nthey had never had enough to eat, and the native teacher stated that\nthis was probably true.\n\nThe wide gulf between the tao and the rich man is filled by the\ngreat middle class of Filipinos.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VIII. - VISIT TO A LEPER COLONY.\n\n\nNot far from our town was a leper colony and the first Saturday that\ncould be spared was set aside for a trip to the place. It happened\nthat none of the other Americans were at leisure on this particular\nmorning, but, rather then delay the trip or miss it altogether, the\nwriter, armed with a revolver, started out alone.\n\nThe road had been described so accurately by one who was supposed to\nknow it that it was deemed well-nigh impossible to miss the way. The\nmain highway was followed to the point where the by-path supposed to\nlead to the settlement turned off through some bamboo thickets and a\nlow tropical wood. This path led straight away towards the sea-coast\nwhere the houses of the colony were said to stand in a cocoanut grove\nby the beach.\n\nUpon arriving at the settlement, a very inhospitable reception was\nreceived from a mangy cur that growled and showed a very uninviting\nset of sharp, white teeth behind his snarling lips. The growling of\nthe dog had attracted the attention of an old man who, with age-bent\nback, was pounding rice in a mortar about fifty yards away. He turned\nslowly around and, upon seeing an intruder into the primitive quiet of\nthe place, gave a sharp, far-reaching call. The sound had scarcely\nrung through the grove when from about a dozen of the little grass\nhouses dotted here and there fifteen or twenty men armed with bolos\ncame out and gathered around the old man. A sense of my danger flashed\nupon me. Three miles from town and alone in a tropical jungle, I could\nbe almost instantly overcome by this band of bolo-men, and the only\nreport that would ever reach my people would be that I had\n\"disappeared.\" Of course, attack was by no means certain, but the\npotentiality of the situation was thrilling. A drawn revolver and the\ngleaming of its shining barrel had the effect of stopping the men, who\nseemed to be hesitating as to a course of action, until a somewhat\ndignified retreat was made to an open space in the rear from where a\nless dignified and a more hasty retreat began which did not stop short\nof Bacalod.\n\nEnough had been seen, however, even in this short visit, to give\nconvincing proof that the settlement visited was no colony of lepers;\nso, that afternoon two servant boys being taken as guides and\ninterpreters, another attempt was made to reach the goal desired.\n\nThis attempt was successful, and, after about two hours of walking, a\nlittle cluster of grass huts snugly hidden by the sea-coast came into\nview. As we approached, one would have thought it a gala-day. Some few\nchildren, apparently from six to thirteen years of age, almost wholly\nnude, were romping and playing in the open space around which the huts\nstood, and no one would ever have thought that any cloud so horrible\nas leprosy could hover over a place apparently so happy.\n\nBy the side of the path as we passed was a man and his wife setting\nout potato plants. His hands were so puffed and his fingers so short\nthat he could scarcely use them, but he was working along as best he\ncould. His wife's feet were so swollen and twisted that she walked\nonly with the greatest difficulty. We passed them by and entered the\nopen space above referred to.\n\nThe children now saw us, and those of them who could darted away like\nfrightened rabbits, each to his own burrow. An old man who was sitting\nin the warm afternoon sun on the little bamboo platform before his hut\nwas aroused from his lethargic repose by the scampering away of the\nchildren. He arose, trembling upon his tottering limbs, all drawn and\ntwisted, and hobbled away into his hut.\n\nThe children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at\nthe doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of\nthe settlement. In a few moments we were surrounded by a circle of\nhuman beings at once so repulsive and so pitiable that its graphic\nvividness can never be accurately portrayed.\n\nThe old man referred to above, having put on a pair of snow-white\npantaloons, appeared now at the doorway of his hut, followed a few\nmoments later by his wife who had evidently clothed herself in the\nbest raiment she had. At a call from the old man, all the men, women,\nand children in the settlement came out of their huts and stood in a\nline before us. The old man was spokesman and in his native visayan\ntongue made a heart-rending appeal for aid which we were powerless to\ngive. Attention was called to a leper woman, apparently about\ntwenty-five years of age, whose face had been attacked by the disease\nand whose appearance was truly pathetic. Upon her hip was a child\nabout a year and a half old and, strange to say, the child showed as\nyet no signs whatever of the disease.\n\nWhat an indissoluble enigma is life! Here in a little cluster of grass\nhuts in a secluded nook of a secluded island of an all but secluded\narchipelago was gathered together a little community of wretched\nnatives, driven by their loathsomeness from association with others\neven of the same half-savage race. Yet here, men and women loved and\nwere married, by mutual trust if not by law, and children were born of\nthe union to live forever under the unspeakable horror that\novershadowed the unfortunate parents. Love, hatred, sorrow, and\njoy--every passion that enters into the complex structure of the human\nheart even here, in this scene of sadness and despair, was playing\napparently as freely as where misfortune and disease had never crossed\nthe portals of life.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER IX. - A \"HIKE.\"\n\n\nWe were lounging lazily in our hammocks at Jimamaylan one evening in\nApril. Supper was just ended, and the soldiers in the post were\ncollected in groups here and there spinning yarns to pass away the\ntime, when a Filipino clad only in a loin cloth came down the street\nat a steadily swinging run and stopped in front of the sentry. He\nbrought the announcement that a band of ladrones had just burned a\nsugar mill and were advancing to sack a barrio about fifteen miles\naway.\n\nThe invitation of the commanding officer to go on a \"hike\" was eagerly\naccepted, and, in ten minutes after the message was given, the troops\nwere on the march followed by two adventurous pedagogues.\n\nDarkness was just closing in as we left the town, but a resplendent\ntropic moon soon made the night almost as brilliant as the day. The\ntrail we followed led over rough and rocky country. Sometimes for a\ndistance of a mile or more we passed over barren wastes of volcanic\nslag poured out in anger by some peak whose convulsions have long\nsince ceased. Again we would descend into a tropical jungle from the\ndense foliage of which the ladrones could have leaped at any moment,\nhad they known of our coming, and annihilated our little band. We\nforded rapid streams with the water at our breasts, and halted only\nonce in that rapid march of fifteen miles.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the town we met a man who was standing\nguard against a surprise by the ladrones. Nothing could well have been\nmuch more grotesque and nothing could much better illustrate the\nabsolutely primitive condition of the Filipinos in the interior of the\nislands than the appearance of this guard. A pair of knee pants, a\nconical grass hat, and a hemp shirt formed his entire apparel. A long\nflat wooden shield, a bolo, and a long bamboo spear with a sharp,\nflat, iron point, completed his equipment for battle.\n\nHere stood the first and the twentieth centuries side by side. The\nFilipino who had advanced only a stage beyond the condition of\nprimitive man with his knife, spear, and wooden shield, stood side by\nside with the American soldier, a representative of modern life with\nhis magazine rifle, his canteen, his knapsack,--with every article of\nhis clothing made to give him the highest possible efficiency as the\nunit of a military organization.\n\nA few yards farther on we met another guard equipped similarly to the\nfirst. Upon reaching the town, news had just been received that a\ndetachment of troops from another post had intercepted the ladrones\nand fought a skirmish with them. The ladrones had escaped and we set\nout in pursuit of them on a chase wilder than a Quixotic dream. We\nwound our way into the mountains behind the town, inquiring at every\ngrass hut we passed whether the band of ladrones had passed that way,\nbut only once was even a trace of them found. Then it was learned that\nat a certain place they had separated into groups of three or four and\ngone glimmering through the dream of things that were. This place was\nin a secluded nook of the mountains where in years gone by some\nadventurous Spaniard had erected a primitive water mill to grind his\nsugar-cane. We had now marched about twenty miles and the feet of the\npedagogues were a mass of blisters. They had reached the point where\nthat form of military maneuvering called \"hiking\" ceased to possess\nany alluring charms. So a native was persuaded to come out of his lone\nmountain hut and hitch up his carabao and cart. He was then made to\nget on the carabao's back, while the aforesaid pedagogues lay down on\nthe sugar-cane pulp that had been put into the body of the cart, and\nthe driver was instructed to start for the post we had left hours\nbefore, and not to stop until he got there. Being uncertain but that\nsome of the ladrones would learn of our having left the body of troops\nand would try the metal of our steel, we at first agreed that neither\nof us should go to sleep, but it was later decided that probably the\ndriver had no greater desire to cross the Styx than his passengers had\nand that in case of danger he would awaken us, so both took a revolver\nin each hand, stretched out supinely and went to sleep.\n\nSuch a sleep! The rough jolting of the cart over an almost impassable\nroad was never enough to break the spell of slumber. When we awoke the\nblazing tropic sun was past the midday mark of morning, shining full\ninto our unprotected and well-nigh blistered faces.\n\nA pack of dogs were heralding our approach to a little village at the\nfoot of the mountains where ponies were procured to take us back to\nthe post.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he insists, \"have stood the test of ages; and the plant\nevery where retained its name and credit: and one of our good\nherbarists, who had seen a wonderful case of a swoln spleen, so big, and\nhard as to be felt with terror, brought back to a state of nature by it\"\n\n(p. 37). The greatest portion of Hill's concluding section combines\nadvertisement for the powder medicine he was himself manufacturing at a\nhandsome profit together with a protest against competing apothecaries:\n\"An intelligent person was directed to go to the medicinal herb shops in\nthe several markets, and buy some of this Spleen-wort; the name was\nwritten, and shewn to every one; every shop received his money, and\nalmost every one sold a different plant, under the name of this: but\nwhat is very striking, not one of them the right\" (p. 42).\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis did not cease to be printed after Hill's in\n1766, but continued to issue from the presses into the nineteenth\ncentury. A good example of this is the tome by John Reid, physician to\nthe Finsbury Dispensary in London, Essays on Insanity, Hypochondriasis\nand Other Nervous Affections (1816), which summarizes theories of the\nmalady. A bibliographical study of such works would probably reveal\na larger number of titles in the nineteenth century than in the previous\none, but by this time the nature and definition of hypochondria had\nchanged significantly.\n\nIf John Hill's volume is not an important contribution in the history of\nmedicine, it is a lucid and brief exposition of many of the best ideas\nthat had been thought and written on the hyp, with the exception of his\nuninhibited prescribing of herbal medicines as cure-alls. An\nunderstanding of this disease is essential for readers of neoclassical\nEnglish literature, especially when we reflect upon the fact that some\nof the best literature of the period was composed by writers whom it\nafflicted. It is perhaps not without significance that the greatest poet\nof the Augustan age, Alexander Pope, thought it necessary as he lay on\nhis deathbed in May 1744 to exclaim with his last breath, \"I never was\nhippish in my whole life.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. I. - The NATURE of the DISORDER.\n\n\nTo call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and cruel. It\nis a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by thickened\nand distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver, and other\nparts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick scarce knows\none more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\n\nThe blood is a mixture of many fluids, which, in a state of health, are\nso combined, that the whole passes freely through its appointed vessels;\nbut if by the loss of the thinner parts, the rest becomes too gross to\nbe thus carried through, it will stop where the circulation has least\npower; and having thus stopped it will accumulate; heaping by degrees\nobstruction on obstruction.\n\nHealth and chearfulness, and the quiet exercise of mind, depend upon a\nperfect circulation: is it a wonder then, when this becomes impeded the\nbody looses of its health, and the temper of its sprightliness? to be\notherwise would be the miracle; and he inhumanly insults the afflicted,\nwho calls all this a voluntary frowardness. Its slightest state brings\nwith it sickness, anguish and oppression; and innumerable ills follow\nits advancing steps, unless prevented by timely care; till life itself\ngrows burthensome.\n\nThe disease was common in antient Greece; and her physicians understood\nit, better than those perhaps of later times, in any other country; who\nthough happy in many advantages these fathers of the science could not\nhave, yet want the great assistance of frequent watching it in all its\nstages.\n\nThose venerable writers have delivered its nature, and its cure: in the\nfirst every thing now shews they were right; and what they have said as\nto the latter will be found equally true and certain. This, so far as\npresent experience has confirmed it, and no farther, will be here laid\nbefore the afflicted in a few plain words.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. II. - Persons Subject to it.\n\n\nFatigue of mind, and great exertion of its powers often give birth to\nthis disease; and always tend to encrease it. The finer spirits are\nwasted by the labour of the brain: the Philosopher rises from his study\nmore exhausted than the Peasant leaves his drudgery; without the benefit\nthat he has from exercise. Greatness of mind, and steady virtue;\ndetermined resolution, and manly firmness, when put in action, and\nintent upon their object, all also lead to it: perhaps whatever tends to\nthe ennobling of the soul has equal share in bringing on this weakness\nof the body.\n\nFrom this we may learn easily who are the men most subject to it; the\ngrave and studious, those of a sedate temper and enlarged understanding,\nthe learned and wise, the virtuous and the valiant: those whom it were\nthe interest of the world to wish were free from this and every other\nillness; and who perhaps, except for this alloy, would have too large a\nportion of human happiness.\n\nThough these are most, it is not these alone, who are subject to it.\n\nThere are countries where it is endemial, and in other places some have\nthe seeds of it in their constitution; and in some it takes rise from\naccidents. In these last it is the easiest of cure; and in the first\nmost difficult.\n\nBeside the Greeks already named, the Jews of old time were heavily\nafflicted with this disease; and in their descendants to this day it is\noften constitutional: the Spaniards have it almost to a man; and so have\nthe American Indians. Perhaps the character of these several nations may\nbe connected with it. The steady honour, and firm valour of the\nSpaniard, very like that of the ancient Doric nation, who followed the\nflute not the trumpet to the field; and met the enemy, not with shouts\nand fury, but with a determined virtue: it is the temper of the\nHypochondriac to be slow, but unmoveably resolved: the Jew has shewn\nthis mistakenly, but almost miraculously; and the poor Indian, untaught\nas he is, faces all peril with composure, and sings his death-song with\nan unalter'd countenance.\n\nAmong particular persons the most inquiring and contemplative are those\nwho suffer oftenest by this disease; and of all degrees of men I think\nthe clergy. I do not mean the hunting, shooting, drinking clergy, who\nbear the tables of the great; but the retir'd and conscientious; such as\nattend in midnight silence to their duty; and seek in their own cool\nbreasts, or wheresoever else they may be found, new admonitions for an\nage plunged in new vices. To this disease we owe the irreparable loss of\nDr. YOUNG; and the present danger of many other the best and most\nimproved amongst us. May what is here to be proposed assist in their\npreservation!\n\nThe Geometrician or the learned Philosopher of whatever denomination,\nwhose course of study fixes his eye for ever on one object, his mind\nintensely and continually employed upon one thought, should be warned\nalso that he is in danger; or if he find himself already afflicted, he\nshould be told that the same course of life, which brought it on, will,\nwithout due care, encrease it to the most dreaded violence.\n\nThe middle period of life is that in which there is the greatest danger\nof an attack from this disease; and the latter end of autumn, when the\nsummer heats have a little time been over, is the season when in our\nclimate its first assaults are most to be expected. The same time of the\nyear always increases the disorder in those who have been before\nafflicted with it; and it is a truth must be confessed, that from its\nfirst attack the patient grows continually, though slowly, worse; unless\na careful regimen prevent it.\n\nThe constitutions most liable to this obstruction are the lean, and dark\ncomplexioned; the grave and sedentary. Let such watch the first\nsymptoms; and obviate, (as they may with ease) that which it will be\nmuch more difficult to remove.\n\nIt is happy a disease, wherein the patient must do a great deal for\nhimself, falls, for the most part, upon those who have the powers of\nreason strongest. Let them only be aware of this, that the distemper\nnaturally disposes them to inactivity; and reason will have no use\nunless accompanied with resolution to enforce it.\n\nThough the physician can do something toward the cure, much more depends\nupon the patient; and here his constancy of mind will be employed most\nhappily. No one is better qualified to judge on a fair hearing what\ncourse is the most fit; and having made that choice, he must with\npatience wait its good effects. Diseases that come on slowly must have\ntime for curing; an attention to the first appearances of the disorder\nwill be always happiest; because when least established it is easiest\noverthrown: but when that happy period has been neglected, he must wait\nthe effects of such a course as will dilute and melt the obstructing\nmatter gradually; for till that be done it is not only vain, but\nsometimes dangerous, to attempt its expulsion from the body.\n\nThe blood easily separates itself into the grosser and the thinner\nparts: we see this in bleeding; and from the toughness of the red cake\nmay guess how very difficult it will be to dissolve a substance of like\nfirmness in the vessels of the body. That it can thus become thickened\nwithin the body, a Pleurisy shews us too evidently: in that case it is\nbrought on suddenly, and with inflammation; in this other, slowly and\nwithout; and here, even before it forms the obstruction, can bring on\nmany mischiefs. Various causes can produce the same effect, but that in\nall cases operates most durably, which operates most slowly. The watery\npart of the blood is its mild part; in the remaining gross matter of it,\nare acrid salts and burning oils, and these, when destitute of that\nhappy dilution nature gives them in a healthy body, are capable of doing\ngreat mischief to the tender vessels in which they are kept stagnant.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. III. - The SYMPTOMS of the DISORDER.\n\n\nThe first and lightest of the signs that shew this illness are a lowness\nof spirits, and inaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love\nof solitude and a habit of thinking, even on trifling subjects, with too\nmuch steadiness. A very little help may combat these: but if that\nindolence which is indeed a part of the disorder, will neglect them;\nworse must be expected soon to follow.\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness, weight, and oppression in the body,\na want of appetite, or, what is worse, an appetite without digestion;\nfor these are the conditions of different states of the disease, a\nfullness and a difficulty of breathing after meals, a straitness of the\nbreast, pains and flatulencies in the bowels, and an unaptness to\ndischarge their contents.\n\nThe pulse becomes low, weak, and unequal; and there are frequent\npalpitations of the heart, a little dark-coloured urine is voided at\nsome times; and a flood of colourless and insipid at others; relieving\nfor a moment, but increasing the distemper: there is in some cases also\na continual teazing cough, with a choaking stoppage in the throat at\ntimes; then heartburn, sickness, hardness of the belly, and a costive\nhabit, or a tormenting and vain irritation.\n\nThe lips turn pale, the eyes loose their brightness and by degrees the\nwhite grows as it were greenish, the gums want their due firmness, with\ntheir proper colour; and an unpleasing foulness grows upon the teeth:\nthe inside of the mouth is pale and furred, and the throat dry and\nhusky: the colour of the skin is pale (though there are periods when the\nface is florid) and as the obstruction gathers ground, and more affects\nthe liver, the whole body becomes yellow, tawny, greenish, and at length\nof that deep and dusky hue, to which men of swift imagination have given\nthe name of blackness.\n\nThese symptoms do not all appear in any one period of the disease, or in\none case, but at one time or other all of them, as well as those which\nfollow: the flesh becomes cold to the touch, though the patient does not\nhimself perceive it; the limbs grow numbed and torpid, the breathing\ndull and slow, and the voice hollow; and usually the appetite in this\nperiod declines, and comes almost to nothing: night sweats come on,\nblack swellings appear on the veins, the flesh wastes and the breast\nbecomes flat and hollow: the mouth is full of a thin spittle, the head\nis dizzy and confus'd, and sometimes there is an unconquerable numbness\nin the organs of speech.\n\nI have known the temporary silence that follows upon this last symptom\nbecome a jest to the common herd; and the unhappy patient, instead of\ncompassion and assistance, receive the reproof of sullenness, from those\nwho should have known and acted better.\n\nAbout twenty years ago I met on a visit at Catthorpe in Leicestershire a\nyoung gentleman of distinguished learning and abilities, who at certain\ntimes was speechless. The vulgar thought it a pretence: and a jocose\nlady, where he was at tea with company, putting him as she said to a\ntrial, poured out a dish very strong and without sugar. He drank it and\nreturned the cup with a bow of great reserve, and his eye bent on the\nground: she then filled the cup with sugar, and pouring weak tea on it,\nsent it him: he drank that too, looked at her steadily, and blushed for\nher. The lady declared the man was dumb; the rest thought him perverse,\nand obstinate; but a constant and steady perseverance in an easy method\ncured him.\n\nAll these are miseries which the disease, while it retains its natural\nform, can bring upon the patient; and thus he will in time be worn out,\nand led miserably, though slowly, to the grave. Let him not indulge his\ninactivity so far as to give way to this, because it is represented as\nfar off; the disease may suddenly and frightfully change its nature; and\nswifter evils follow.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. IV. - The DANGER.\n\n\nWe have done with the obstruction considered in itself; but this, though\noften unsurmountable by art, at least by the methods now in use, will be\nsometimes broken through at once by nature, or by accidents; and bring\non fatal evils. These are strictly different diseases, and are no\notherway concerned here, than as the consequences of that of which we\nare treating.\n\nThe thick and glutinous blood which has so long stagnated in the spleen,\nwill have in that time altered its nature, and acquired a very great\ndegree of acrimony: while it lies dormant, this does no more mischiefs,\nthan those named already; but when violent exercise, a fit of outrageous\nanger, or any thing else that suddenly shocks and disturbs the frame,\nputs it in motion, it melts at once into a kind of liquid putrefaction.\n\nBeing now thin, it mixes itself readily with the blood again, and brings\non putrid fevers; destroys the substance of the spleen itself, or being\nthrown upon some other of the viscera, corrodes them, and leads on this\nway a swift and miserable death. If it fall upon the liver, its tender\npulpy substance is soon destroyed, jaundices beyond the help of art\nfirst follow, then dropsies and all their train of misery; if on lungs,\nconsumptions; if on the brain, convulsions, epilepsy, palsy, apoplexy;\nif on the surface, leprosy.\n\nThe intention of cure is to melt this coagulation softly, not to break\nit violently; and then to give it a very gentle passage through the\nbowels. There is no safe way for it to take but that; and even that when\nurged too far may bring on fatal dysenteries.\n\nLet none wonder at the sudden devastation which sometimes arises from\nthis long stagnant matter, when liquified too hastily: how long, how\nmany years the impacted matter will continue quiet in a schirrous tumour\nof the breast; but being once put in motion, whether from accident, or\nin the course of nature, what can describe; or what can stop its\nhavock!\n\nInstances of the other are too frequent. A nobleman the other day died\nparalytick: dissection shewed a spleen consumed by an abscess, formed\nfrom the dissolved matter of such an obstruction: and 'tis scarce longer\nsince, a learned gentleman, who had been several years lost to his\nfriends, by the extreams of a Hypochondriacal disorder, seem'd gradually\nwithout assistance to recover: but the lungs suffered while the spleen\nwas freed; and he died very soon of what is called a galloping\nconsumption.\n\nWhen the obstruction is great and of long continuance, if it be thus\nhastily moved, the consequence is, equally, a sudden and a miserable\ndeath, whether, like the matter of a cancer, it remains in its place; or\nlike that of a bad small pox, be thrown upon some other vital part.\n\nLet not the patient be too much alarmed; this is laid down to caution,\nnot to terrify him: it is fit he should know his danger, and attend to\nit; for the prevention is easy; and the cure, even of the most advanced\nstages, when undertaken by gentle means, is not at all impracticable: to\nassist the physician, let him look into himself, and recollect the\nsource of his complaint. This he may judge of from the following\nnotices.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. V. - The Causes of the HYPOCHONDRIASIS.\n\n\nThe obstruction which forms this disease, may take its origin from\ndifferent accidents: a fever ill cured has often caused it; or the\npiles, which had been used to discharge largely, ceasing; a marshy soil,\npoisoned with stagnant water, has given it to some persons; and altho'\nindolence and inactivity are oftenest at the root, yet it has arisen\nfrom too great exercise.\n\nReal grief has often brought it on; and even love, for sometimes that is\nreal. Study and fixed attention of the mind have been accused before;\nand add to these the stooping posture of the body, which most men use,\nthough none should use it, in writing and in reading. This has\ncontributed too much to it; but of all other things night studies are\nthe most destructive. The steady stillness, and dusky habit of all\nnature in those hours, enforce, encourage, and support that settled\ngloom, which rises from fixt thought; and sinks the body to the grave;\neven while it carries up the mind to heaven. He who would have his lamp\n        At midnight hour\n  Be seen in some high lonely tower,\nwill waste the flame of this unheeded life: and while he labours to\nunsphere the spirit of Plato will let loose his own.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VI. - The Cure of the HYPOCHONDRIASIS.\n\n\nLet him who would escape the mischiefs of an obstructed spleen, avoid\nthe things here named: and let him who suffers from the malady,\nendeavour to remember to which of them it has been owing; for half the\nhope depends upon that knowledge.\n\nNature has sometimes made a cure herself, and we should watch her ways;\nfor art never is so right as when it imitates her: sometimes the\npatient's own resolution has set him free. This is always in his power,\nand at all times will do wonders.\n\nThe bleeding of the piles, from nature's single efforts, has at once\ncured a miserable man; where their cessation was the cause of the\ndisorder. A leprosy has appeared upon the skin, and all the symptoms of\nthe former sickness vanished. This among the Jews happened often: both\ndiseases we know were common among them: and I have here seen something\nvery like it: Water-Dock has thrown out scorbutic eruptions, and all the\nformer symptoms of an Hypochondriacal disorder have disappeared:\nreturning indeed when these were unadvisedly struck in; but keeping off\nentirely when they were better treated. A natural purging unsuppressed\nhas sometimes done the same good office: but this is hazardous.\n\nIt is easy to be directed from such instances; only let us take the\nwhole along with us. Bleeding would have answered nature's purpose, if\nshe could not have opened of herself the h\u00e6morrhoidal vessels; but he\nwho should give medicines for that purpose, might destroy his patient by\ntoo great disturbance. If a natural looseness may perform the cure, so\nmay an artificial; when the original source of the disorder points that\nway. But these are helps that take place only in particular cases.\n\nThe general and universal method of cure must be by some mild and gently\nresolving medicine, under the influence of which the obstructing matter\nmay be voided that, or some other way with safety. The best season to\nundertake this is the autumn, but even here there must be caution.\n\nIn the first place, no strong evacuating remedy must be given; for that,\nby carrying off the thinner parts of the juices, will tend to thicken\nthe remainder; and certainly encrease the distemper. No acrid medicine\nmust be directed, for that may act too hastily, dissolve the impacted\nmatter at once, and let it loose, to the destruction of the sufferer; no\nantimonial, no mercurial, no martial preparation must be taken; in\nshort, no chymistry: nature is the shop that heaven has set before us,\nand we must seek our medicine there. The venerable ancients, who knew\nnot this new art, will lead us in the search; and (faithful relators as\nthey are of truth) will tell us whence we may deduce our hope; and what\nwe are to fear.\n\nBut prior to the course of any medicine, and as an essential to any good\nhope from it, the patient must prescribe himself a proper course of\nlife, and a well chosen diet: let us assist him in his choice; and speak\nof this first, as it comes first in order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VI. - Rules of Life for Hypochondriac Persons.\n\n\nAir and exercise, as they are the best preservers of health, and\ngreatest assistants in the cure of all long continued diseases, will\nhave their full effect in this; but there requires some caution in the\nchoice, and management of them. It is common to think the air of high\ngrounds best; but experience near home shews otherwise: the\nHypochondriac patient is always worse at Highgate even than in London.\n\nThe air he breathes should be temperate; not exposed to the utmost\nviolences of heat and cold, and the swift changes from one to the\nother; which are most felt on those high grounds. The side of a hill is\nthe best place for him: and though wet grounds are hurtful; yet let\nthere be the shade of trees, to tempt him often to a walk; and soften by\ntheir exhalation the over dryness of the air.\n\nThe exercise he takes should be frequent; but not violent. Motion\npreserves the firmness of the parts, and elasticity of the vessels; it\nprevents that aggregation of thick humours which he is most to fear. A\nsedentary life always produces weakness, and that mischief always\nfollows: weak eyes are gummy, weak lungs are clogged with phlegm, and\nweak bowels waste themselves in vapid diarrhoeas.\n\nLet him invite himself abroad, and let his friends invite him by every\ninnocent inducement. For me, I should advise above all other things the\nstudy of nature. Let him begin with plants: he will here find a\ncontinual pleasure, and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful\nthings; even of the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to\nwalk; and every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket,\nwill afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually\nin the air, and continually to change the nature and quality of the air,\nby visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the lawn, the\nheath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be abroad; and the\nunceasing variety of the subjects of his observation, will prevent his\nwalking hastily: he will pursue his studies in the air; and that\ncontemplative turn of mind, which in his closet threatened his\ndestruction, will thus become the great means of his recovery.\n\nIf the mind tire upon this, from the repeated use, another of nature's\nkingdoms opens itself at once upon him; the plant he is weary of\nobserving, feeds some insect he may examine; nor is there a stone that\nlies before his foot, but may afford instruction and amusement.\n\nEven what the vulgar call the most abject things will shew a wonderful\nutility; and lead the mind, in pious contemplation higher than the\nstars. The poorest moss that is trampled under foot, has its important\nuses: is it at the bottom of a wood we find it? why there it shelters\nthe fallen seeds; hides them from birds, and covers them from frost;\nand thus becomes the foster father of another forest! creeps it along\nthe surface of a rock? even there its good is infinite! its small roots\nrun into the stone, and the rains make their way after them; the moss\nhaving lived its time dies; it rots and with the mouldered fragments of\nthe stone forms earth; wherein, after a few successions, useful plants\nmay grow, and feed more useful cattle!\n\nIs there a weed more humble in its aspect, more trampled on, or more\ndespised than knot grass! no art can get the better of its growth, no\nlabour can destroy it; 'twere pity if they could, for the thing lives\nwhere nothing would of use to us; and its large and most wonderfully\nabundant seeds, feed in hard winters, half the birds of Heaven.\n\nWhat the weak moss performs upon the rock the loathed toadstool brings\nabout in timber: is an oak dead where man's eye will not find it? this\nfungus roots itself upon the bark, and rots the wood beneath it; hither\nthe beetle creeps for shelter, and for sustenance; him the woodpecker\nfollows as his prey; and while he tears the tree in search of him, he\nscatters it about the ground; which it manures.\n\nNor is it the beetle alone that thus insinuates itself into the\nsubstance of the vegetable tribe: the tender aphide, whom a touch\ndestroys, burrows between the two skins of a leaf, for shelter from his\nwinged enemies; tracing, with more than Dedal\u00e6an art, his various\nmeanders; and veining the green surface with these white lines more\nbeautifully than the best \u00c6gyptian marble.\n\n'Twere endless to proceed; nor is it needful: one object will not fail\nto lead on to another, and every where the goodness of his God will\nshine before him even in what are thought the vilest things; his\ngreatness in the lead of them.\n\nLet him pursue these thoughts, and seek abroad the objects and the\ninstigations to them: but let him in these and all other excursions\navoid equally the dews of early morning, and of evening.\n\nThe more than usual exercise of this prescription will dispose him to\nmore than customary sleep, let him indulge it freely; so far from\nhurting, it will help his cure.\n\nLet him avoid all excesses: drink need scarce be named, for we are\nwriting to men of better and of nobler minds, than can be tempted to\nthat humiliating vice. Those who in this disorder have too great an\nappetite, must not indulge it; much eaten was never well digested: but\nof all excesses the most fatal in this case is that of venery. It is the\nexcess we speak of.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VII. - The proper DIET.\n\n\nIn the first place acids must be avoided carefully; and all things that\nare in a state of fermentation, for they will breed acidity. Provisions\nhardened by salting never should be tasted; much less those cured by\nsmoaking, and by salting. Bacon is indigestible in an Hypochondriac\nstomach; and hams, impregnated as is now the custom, with acid fumes\nfrom the wood fires over which they are hung, have that additional\nmischief.\n\nMilk ought to be a great article in the diet: and even in this there\nshould be choice. The milk of grass-fed cows has its true quality: no\nother. There are a multitude of ways in which this may be made a part\nboth of our foods and drinks, and they should all be used.\n\nThe great and general caution is that the diet be at all times of a kind\nloosening and gently stimulating; light but not acrid. Veal, lamb,\nfowls, lobsters, crabs, craw-fish, fresh water fish and mutton broth,\nwith plenty of boiled vegetables, are always right; and give enough\nvariety.\n\nRaw vegetables are all bad: sour wines, old cheese, and bottled beer are\nthings never to be once tasted. Indeed much wine is wrong, be it of what\nkind soever. It is the first of cordials; and as such I would have it\ntaken in this disease when it is wanted: plainly as a medicine, rather\nthan a part of diet. Malt liquor carefully chosen is certainly the best\ndrink. This must be neither new, nor tending to sourness; perfectly\nclear, and of a moderate strength: it is the native liquor of our\ncountry, and the most healthful.\n\nToo much tea weakens; and even sugar is in this disorder hurtful: but\nhoney may supply its place in most things; and this is not only harmless\nbut medicinal; a very powerful dissolvent of impacted humours, and a\ngreat deobstruent.\n\nWhat wine is drank should be of some of the sweet kinds. Old Hock has\nbeen found on enquiry to yield more than ten times the acid of the sweet\nwines; and in red Port, at least in what we are content to call so,\nthere is an astringent quality, that is most mischievous in these cases:\nit is said there is often alum in it: how pregnant with mischief that\nmust be to persons whose bowels require to be kept open, is most\nevident. Summer fruits perfectly ripe are not only harmless but\nmedicinal; but if eaten unripe they will be very prejudicial. A light\nsupper, which will leave an appetite for a milk breakfast, is always\nright; this will not let the stomach be ravenous for dinner, as it is\napt to be in those who make that their only meal.\n\nOne caution more must be given, and it may seem a strange one: it is\nthat the patient attend regularly to his hours of eating. We have to do\nwith men for the most part whose soul is the great object of their\nregard; but let them not forget they have a body.\n\nThe late Dr. STUKELY has told me, that one day by appointment visiting\nSir ISAAC NEWTON, the servant told him, he was in his study. No one was\npermitted to disturb him there; but as it was near dinner time, the\nvisitor sat down to wait for him. After a time dinner was brought in; a\nboil'd chicken under a cover. An hour pass'd, and Sir ISAAC did not\nappear. The doctor eat the fowl, and covering up the empty dish, bad\nthem dress their master another. Before that was ready, the great man\ncame down; he apologiz'd for his delay, and added, \"give me but leave to\ntake my short dinner, and I shall be at your service; I am fatigued and\nfaint.\" Saying this, he lifted up the cover; and without any emotion,\nturned about to STUKELY with a smile; \"See says he, what we studious\npeople are, I forgot I had din'd.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VIII. - The MEDICINE.\n\n\n'Tis the ill fate of this disease, more than of all others to be\nmisunderstood at first, and thence neglected; till the physician shakes\nhis head at a few first questions. None steals so fatally upon the\nsufferer: its advances are by very slow degrees; but every day it grows\nmore difficult of cure.\n\nThat this obstruction in the spleen is the true malady, the cases\nrelated by the antients, present observation, and the unerring\ntestimonies of dissections leave no room to doubt. Being understood, the\npath is open where to seek a remedy: and our best guides in this, as in\nthe former instance, will be those venerable Greeks; who saw a thousand\nof these cases, where we see one; and with less than half our theory,\ncured twice as many patients.\n\nOne established doctrine holds place in all these writers; that whatever\nby a hasty fermentation dissolves the impacted matter of the\nobstruction, and sends it in that state into the blood, does incredible\nmischief: but that whatever medicine softens it by slow degrees, and, as\nit melts, delivers it to the bowels without disturbance; will cure with\nequal certainty and safety.\n\nFor this good purpose, they knew and tried a multitude of herbs; but in\nthe end they fixed on one: and on their repeated trials of this, they\nbanished all the rest. This stood alone for the cure of the disease; and\nfrom its virtue received the name of SPLEEN-WORT. O wise and happy\nGreeks! authors of knowledge and perpetuators of it! With them the very\nname they gave a plant declared its virtues: with us, a writer calls a\nplant from some friend; that the good gardener who receives the honour,\nmay call another by his name who gave it. We now add the term smooth\nto this herb, to distinguish it from another, called by the same general\nterm, though not much resembling it.\n\nThe virtues of this smooth Spleen-wort have flood the test of ages; and\nthe plant every where retained its name and credit: and one of our good\nherbalists, who had seen a wonderful case of a swoln spleen, so big, and\nhard as to be felt with terror, brought back to a state of nature by it;\nand all the miserable symptoms vanish; thought Spleen-wort not enough\nexpressive of its excellence; but stamp'd on it the name of MILT-WASTE.\n\nIn the Greek Islands now, the use of it is known to every one; and even\nthe lazy monks who take it, are no longer splenetic. In the west of\nEngland, the rocks are stripped of it with diligence; and every old woman\ntells you how charming that leaf is for bookish men: in Russia they use\na plant of this kind in their malt liquor: it came into fashion there\nfor the cure of this disease; which from its constant use is scarce\nknown any longer; and they suppose 'tis added to their liquor for a\nflavour.\n\nThe ancients held it in a kind of veneration; and used what has been\ncalled a superstition in the gathering it. It was to be taken up with a\nsharp knife, without violence, and laid upon the clean linen: no time\nbut the still darkness of the night was proper, and even the moon was\nnot to shine upon it. I know they have been ridiculed for this; for\nnothing is so vain as learned ignorance: but let me be permitted once to\nvindicate them.\n\nThe plant has leaves that can close in their sides; and their under part\nis covered thick with a yellow powder, consisting of the seeds, and seed\nvessels: in these they knew the virtue most resided: this was the golden\ndust they held so valuable; and this they knew they could not be too\ncautious to preserve. They were not ignorant of the sleep of plants; a\nmatter lately spoken of by some, as if a new discovery; and being\nsensible that light, a dry air, an expanded leaf, and a tempestuous\nseason, were the means of losing this fine dust; and knowing also that\ndarkness alone brought on that closing of the leaf which thence has\nbeen called sleep; and which helped to defend and to secure it, they\ntherefore took such time, and used such means as could best preserve the\nplant entire; and even save what might be scattered from it.--And now\nwhere is their superstition?\n\nFrom this plant thus collected they prepared a medicine, which in a\ncourse of forty days scarce ever failed to make a perfect cure.\n\nWe have the plant wild with us; and till the fashion of rough chemical\npreparations took off our attention from these gentler remedies, it was\nin frequent use and great repute. I trust it will be so again: and many\nthank me for restoring it to notice.\n\nSpleen-wort gives out its virtues freely in a tincture; and a small dose\nof this, mixing readily with the blood and juices, gradually dissolves\nthe obstruction; and by a little at a time delivers its contents to be\nthrown off without pain, from the bowels. Let this be done while the\nviscera are yet sound and the cure is perfect. More than the forty days\nof the Greek method is scarce ever required; much oftener two thirds of\nthat time suffice; and every day, from the first dose of it, the patient\nfeels the happy change that is growing in his constitution. His food no\nmore turns putrid on his stomach, but yields its healthful nourishment.\n\nThe swelling after meals therefore vanishes; and with that goes the\nlowness, and anxiety, the difficult breath, and the distracting cholick:\nhe can bear the approach of rainy weather without pain; he finds himself\nmore apt for motion, and ready to take that exercise which is to be\nassistant in his cure; life seems no longer burthensome. His bowels get\ninto the natural condition of health, and perform their office once at\nleast a day; better if a little more: the dull and dead colour of his\nskin goes off, his lips grow red again, and every sign of health\nreturns.\n\nLet him who takes the medicine, say whether any thing here be\nexaggerated. Let him, if he pleases to give himself the trouble, talk\nover with me, or write to me, this gradual decrease of his complaints,\nas he proceeds in his cure. My uncertain state of health does not\npermit me to practise physic in the usual way, but I am very desirous to\ndo what good I can, and shall never refuse my advice, such as it may be,\nto any person rich or poor, in whatever manner he may apply for it. I\nshall refer him to no apothecary, whose bills require he should be\ndrenched with potions; but tell him, in this as in all other cases,\nwhere to find some simple herb; which he may if he please prepare\nhimself; or if he had rather spare that trouble, may have it so prepared\nfrom me.\n\nWith regard to Spleen-wort, no method of using it is more effectual than\nsimply taking it in powder; the only advantage of a tincture, is that a\nproper dose may be given, and yet the stomach not be loaded with so\nlarge a quantity: it is an easier and pleasanter method, and nothing\nmore.\n\nIf any person choose to take it in the other way, I should still wish\nhim once at least to apply to me; that he may be assured what he is\nabout to take is the right plant. Abuses in medicines are at this time\nvery great, and in no instance worse than what relates to herbs. The\nbest of our physicians have complained upon this head with warmth, but\nwithout redress: they know the virtues and the value of many of our\nnative plants, but dread to prescribe them; lest some wrong thing should\nbe administered in their place; perhaps inefficacious, perhaps\nmischievous, nay it may be fatal. The few simple things I direct are\nalways before me; and it will at all times be a pleasure to me, in this\nand any other instance, to see whether what any person is about to take\nbe right. I have great obligations to the public, and this is the best\nreturn that I know how to make.\n\nTo see the need of such a caution, hear a transaction but of yesterday!\n\nAn intelligent person was directed to go to the medicinal herb shops in\nthe several markets, and buy some of this Spleen-wort; the name was\nwritten, and shewn to every one; every shop received his money, and\nalmost every one sold a different plant, under the name of this: but\nwhat is very striking, not one of them the right. Such is the chance of\nhealth in those hands through which the best means of it usually pass;\neven in the most regular course of application.\n\nI would not be understood to limit the little services I may this way be\nable to render the afflicted, to this single instance; much less to\npropose to myself any advantages from it. Whoever pleases will be\nwelcome to me, upon any such occasion; and whatever be the herb on which\nhe places a dependance, he shall be shewn it growing. I once recommended\na garden to be established for this use, at the public expence: one\ngreat person has put it in my power to answer all its purposes.\n\n                        F  I  N  I  S.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris, he was\n\"nominated\" to the Academy. He had but to present an Historical\nPainting in order to take his seat as an Academician.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VENUS AND MARRIAGE\n\n\nBack in his beloved Paris again; thrilled by the atmosphere and gaiety\nof its merry life; in the full vigour of manhood on the eve of his\nthirties; amongst congenial friends; done with the drudgery of winning\nto Academic honour, Boucher saw that the public were not falling over\neach other to purchase religious or historic pictures; he straightway\nturned his back upon these things, and on the edge of his thirtieth\nyear he gave to the world his \"Marriage of the Children of God with\nthe Children of Men,\" in which Venus is the avowed mistress of his\nadoration. It caused a fine stir, and greatly increased his repute.\n\nIn this picture he ends his Italian period and strikes his own\npersonal note. Both this and the \"Venus asking arms for Aeneas from\nVulcan,\" together with the \"Birth of Adonis\" and the \"Death of\nAdonis,\" of about the same period, still show Boucher strongly under\nthe influence of his master, Lemoyne. Indeed, the \"Birth\" and \"Death\nof Adonis,\" their record lost during the scuffle and confusion of the\nRevolution, for long hung side by side as pictures by Lemoyne, until,\nbeing cleaned about 1860, Boucher's initials were discovered upon\nthem, and, contemporary engravings being hunted up, still further\nproved their origin. But in the Venus that now figures in all his\nworks there is that flesh-painting of the nude, and that rosy touch\nupon the flesh of the female figure, that are a far more certain\nsignature of Boucher's handiwork than any written name.\n\nUnfortunately the Salons were closed during Boucher's earlier years\nuntil he was thirty-four, and the record of his work during these\nyears is difficult to follow; but with his service to Venus his\npersonal career begins, and the stream of his Venus-pieces steadily\nflows from his hands.\n\nHe came to her service rid of all prentice essays in craftsmanship, a\nfinished and consummate artist. He found in his subject a goddess to\nwhom he could devote his great and splendid gifts. He painted her\ndainty body with a radiant delight and a rare colour-sense such as\nFrance had never before seen or uttered. He remains to this day the\nfirst painter of the subtle, delicate, and elusive thing that is\nfemininity; he caught her allure, her charm, as he was to catch the\nfragrance and charm of children and flowers; and he set the statement\nof these things upon canvas as they have never been uttered.\n\nThe whole of his life long, Boucher gave himself up with equal and\npassionate devotion to work and to pleasure--working at his easel\noften twelve hours of his day without losing, to the end when the\nbrush fell from his dead fingers, his blitheness of heart or his\ngenerosity of act, and without weakening the pleasure-loving desires\nof his gadding spirit. Out of his splendid toil he made the means to\nindulge his tastes for pleasure; and the gratifying of his tastes in\nturn renewed and created the ideas that made the subjects of his\nartistry. He brought to all he did a joy in the doing that made of his\nvast labour one long pleasure--of his pleasures a riot of industry. He\nplayed as he toiled, scarce knowing which was play and which toil.\n\nThe gossip of his love-affairs makes no romantic story--they were but\ncommonplace ecstasies with unknown frail women. But hard as he worked\nand lived and played, he found time to get himself married in his\nthirtieth year to pretty seventeen-year-old Marie Jeanne Buseau, a\nlittle Parisian--and for love of her, so far as he understood the\nbusiness; for she brought him no dowry.\n\nThe young couple settled down for the next ten years in the Rue\nSaint-Thomas-du-Louvre. Here Boucher lived through his thirties.\n\nMadame was a pretty creature, if we had but Latour's pastel portrait\nalone to prove it. But the pretty features were the crown to as pretty\na body, for she sat often to her lord; and it is clear from his\ncorrespondence with a friend, Bachaumont, that she is the Psyche of\nhis illustrated fable--and Psyche runs much to the Altogether.\n\nMarriage, however, was not likely to imprison Boucher's gadding eyes;\nand it did not. Madame Boucher seems to have had as frail a heart, and\navoided strife by amusing herself, amongst others, with the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who, to gain access to the lady,\ncommissioned Boucher to do the Watteau-like illustrations to\nAcajou--a dull affair. Boucher's pretty wife, herself no mean\nartist, worked in his studio, and painted several smaller canvases\nafter his pictures, gaining some fame as a miniaturist and engraver.\n\nNor did Marriage turn Boucher from his art. Two years were gone by\nsince his nomination to the Academy; he had now to paint the formal\nHistorical Picture and present it in order to take his seat as\nAcademician; and it was in this his thirtieth year that he painted and\nwon his academic rank with the \"Renauld et Armide\" now at the Louvre.\n\nHere he sufficiently subordinated his own style to the academic to\nensure success; and the work was hailed by Academicians and critics,\nincluding Diderot, with enthusiasm. But even here we have his cupids\npeeping round the mythologic event; and Armide herself has pretty\nFrench lips that knew no Greek.\n\nOnce secure of his position, he straightway flung the last remnants of\nthe academic style out of his studio door; and it is a grim comment on\ncriticism that it was just exactly in proportion as he developed his\nown personal genius and uttered the France of his day, that he was\nattacked; whilst the stilted things that he knew were third-rate, and\nwhich he wholly rejected from henceforth, were exactly the things that\nwere praised!\n\nHis election to the Academy, and the enthusiasm over the picture that\nwon him his seat thereat, brought his name before the young king; the\nfollowing year he received his first order from the Court whose\npainter he was destined to become. The decorations in the queen's\napartments were gloomy and had grown black; and he painted in their\nstead the \"Charity,\" \"Abundance,\" \"Fidelity,\" and \"Prudence\" still\nthere to be seen. Indeed, with his gay vision, his pretty habit of\nculling only the flowers from the garden of life, and his quickness to\nset down the pleasing thing in every prospect, Boucher was the\ndestined painter of a Court weary of pomposity and the pose of the\nmock-heroic, and which was wholly giving itself up to pleasure and the\nelegances.\n\nBut neither his new dignity of Academician nor the royal favour, kept\nhim from the bookshops; and he illustrated, with rare beauty and a\ncharm worthy of Watteau, the great edition of the Works of Moli\u00e8re\nin his thirty-first year. It is true that he made as free with\nMoli\u00e8re's world as with the Gods of Olympus; he peoples the plays with\ncharacters of his own day, arrayed in the dress and habit of that day,\nand moving in surroundings that he saw about him.\n\n\nLE MONDE QUI S'AMUSE\n\n\nThe Homely had come upon the town out of Holland, painted with most\nconsummate artistry by Chardin, and was soon in the vogue. Boucher had\na quick eye for the mode. And he straightway set himself to the\npainting of \"La Belle Cuisini\u00e8re.\" Still-life and homely subjects need\nan accuracy of realism and a Dutch sense of these things, a sense of\nsincerity and an appreciation of the dignity of the work-a-day life of\nthe people, in which Boucher was wholly lacking. Above all, it calls\nfor a sense of \"character,\" which, in Boucher, was always weak. It was\na sneer against him that his very broomsticks called for pompons and\nribbons--and there was more than a little truth in the spite. He is\nmore concerned with the accident of the kissing of a kitchen-maid than\nwith the kitchen's habit. He cannot even peep into a scullery without\ndragging in Venus by the skirts, and tricking her out in a\nproperty-wardrobe of a scullery-wench, in which the girl is clearly\nbut acting the part.\n\nHowever, these passing vogues and experiments in different methods\nwere only gay asides--he was working the while upon his own subjects;\nand, to the display by its several members ordered by the Academy, he\nsent four little paintings of fauns and cupids which won him the\nhonour of election as deputy-professor. His brain and hand were very\nbusy, and he turns from one thing to another with amazing facility,\nbringing distinction to all that he does.\n\nBut he painted about this time two pictures of infants, \"L'Amour\nOiseleur\" and \"L'Amour Moissonneur,\" which were the beginning of that\nhost of cupids that he let fly from his studio; they frolic across his\ncanvases and join the retinue of Venus, peeping out from clouds, over\nwaves, round curtains, painted with a perfection that has never been\nsurpassed in the portrayal of infants. He painted their round limbs,\ntheir lusty life, their delightful awkwardnesses, their jolly fat\ngrace, their na\u00efve surprise at life and glory in it, as they had never\nbeen painted before, and have never been painted since.\n\nHe also gave forth in this his thirty-third year a \"Pastoral\" and a\n\"Shepherd and Shepherdess in Conversation,\" with sheep about them and\nin a pleasant landscape, which were his first essays in the style that\nhe created and which made him famous.\n\nHis friend Meissonnier, the inventor of the rococo, stood godfather to\nBoucher's first-born son in the May of 1736.\n\nFrom the very beginning Boucher seems to have been engraved. And these\nengravings, done by the best gravers of his day, greatly extended his\nreputation and popularised him; he fully realised the value of the\nadvertisement as well as his profits from it. Before his thirty-third\nyear was run out he published his well-known \"Cries of Paris.\"\n\nBoucher's description of them, \"studies from the low classes,\" holds\nthe key to that something of failure to realise the dramatic verities\nthat is over all; it gives also the attitude of the France that he\nknew towards the France that he did not, and could not understand. He\ncreated that dainty, pleasant atmosphere that comes floating up to the\nwindows on a fresh morning in Paris from the musical cries of\nthe street vendors; but of the deeper significance of the\nstreet-sellers--of the miserable accent in their life, of their weary\ntoil, of the dignity of their labour--he knew nothing; his brush could\nnot refrain from making elegance and fine manners peep from behind the\nstreet-porter's fustian or the milkmaid's skirt.\n\nBut his thirty-third year was to contain a more far-reaching\nsignificance even than the creation of his cupid-pieces and pastorals.\n\nThe \"Cries of Paris\" were scarce printed when Boucher's illustration\nto \"Don Quixote\" appeared--\"Sancho pursued by the servants of the\nDuke.\" This design was to have far-reaching results that Boucher\nlittle suspected.\n\nThe painter Oudry had been called to the conduct of the great tapestry\nlooms at Beauvais a couple of years before; and in his efforts to\nfurnish the looms with good designs, he now called Boucher to his aid,\nwhose original and fresh style, colour, and arrangement, together with\nhis personal vision, and the enthusiasm and zeal with which he threw\nhimself into the work, at once increased the reputation and the\nproducts of the famous looms. This large designing for the tapestries\nwas, in return, of immense value to the development of the genius of\nthe man, enlarging his breadth of style and giving scope to that great\ndecorative sense that was his superb gift. Thenceforth he was destined\nto play a supreme part in the history of the world-famed factories. He\nnow produced painting after painting for the Beauvais looms.\n\nLife is now one long triumph for Boucher, only disturbed in this year\nby the sad news of the suicide of his old master, Lemoyne. It was in\nthis, Boucher's thirty-fourth year, that the Salon was opened for the\nfirst time since Boucher's infancy, and he contributed several\ncanvases to it.\n\nRigaud, the old Academician, now close upon eighty, straggling through\nthe great galleries, might well blink and gasp at the change that had\ncome over French art since he last exhibited there, thirty-three years\ngone by; but his scoffs and regrets held no terrors for the younger\nAcademicians gathered about. He stood in a new world. A new generation\nwas in possession. The grand manner, the severe etiquette, formal\nmock-heroics, and solemn pomposity of Louis the Fourteenth were\nvanished, and the Agreeable and the Pleasant Make-Believe of Louis the\nFifteenth reigned in their stead. Old Rigaud might blink indeed! Just\nas the imposing and stilted etiquette of the reception-room had given\nplace to the easy manners and airy etiquette of the dainty boudoir, so\nhad light chatter and gay wit and the quick repartee usurped the heavy\nsplendours of a consequential age. France, weary of an eternal pose of\nthe grand manner, was seeking change in joyousness and amusement.\n\nGallantry and gaiety were become the object of the ambition of a\ndandified and elegant day. France became a coquette; dressed herself\nas a porcelain shepherdess; and with beribboned crook and sheep,\nseeking pleasant prospects to stroll through, gave herself to\ndalliance--her powder-puff and patch-box and fan a serious part of her\nunseriousness.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE CH\u00c2TEAUROUX\n\n\nAt thirty-five Boucher has arrived. He is in the vogue; in favour at\nCourt--as well as in the fashion. In his three years from taking his\nseat at the Academy to the opening of the first Salon he has created a\nnew and original style--his cupid pieces, his pastorals, his\nVenus-pieces, his tapestry. Boucher's kingdom lay in the realm of the\ndecorative painter--and he has found it. Torn from the surroundings\nfor which he designed them, as part and parcel of the general scheme,\nhis pictures are as out of place as an Italian altarpiece in an\nEnglish dining-room, yet they suffer less. Several may still be seen,\nas he set them up in frames of his own planning, as overdoors in the\npalace of the Soubise, now given up to the national archives.\n\nThe ghost of the Prince of Soubise, who commissioned them, may haunt\nhis palace, but his kin know the place no longer. The overdoors\nwrought by Boucher's skill look down now on the nation's collection of\nhistoric documents. The \"Three Graces enchaining Love,\" the fine\npastoral of \"The Cage,\" and the pastoral of the \"Shepherd placing a\nRose in his Shepherdess's Hair,\" were to see a mightier change than\nthe usurpation of Louis the Fourteenth's pompous age by the elegant\nyears of Louis the Fifteenth. But this was not as yet. Here at least\nwe see Boucher's art rid of all outside influences, and at the full\ntide of creation; here we have the inimitable lightness of touch, the\nfigures and landscape bathed in the airy volume of atmosphere.\n\nHe seems at this time to have played with pastel, due probably to his\nfriendship with Latour, who sent a portrait of Boucher's wife to this\nSalon. Boucher showed in the use of chalks the artistry and skill that\nwere always at his command.\n\nHe also was putting to its full use his innate sense of landscape,\nraising to high achievement that astonishing balance of landscape and\nfigures in his design--a balance that has never been surpassed; his\nfigures never override his landscape; his landscape never overpowers\nhis figures. His earnest counsels to his pupils and his constant\ndeploring of the lack of the landscape art in France prove the great\nstress he laid upon it.\n\nThe designing of a frontispiece for the catalogue of a personal\nfriend, one Gersaint, a merchant of oriental wares, started Boucher in\nhis thirty-third year upon that series of Chinese pictures and\ntapestries known as the \"Chinoiseries,\" in which he frittered away\nonly too many precious hours, for they were received with great favour\nby the public. The paintings of Chinese subjects designed for the\nlooms of Beauvais are still to be seen at Besan\u00e7on.\n\nBut busy as were his brain and hand in the exercise of his wide and\nversatile gifts, pouring out \"Chinoiseries,\" illustrations for books,\ntapestries on a large scale, landscapes, models for the gilt bronze\ndecorations of porcelain vases, scheming handsome frames for his\npictures, designing furniture and fans--Boucher was true, above all,\n\"to his goddess,\" and painted the famed \"Birth of Venus,\" which,\nthanks to the Swedish Ambassador's fondness for Madame Boucher, now\nhangs at Stockholm; our amorous Count de Tessin, to be just, seems to\nhave had a rare flair for the artistic--besides artist's wives. It was\non the 15th of April in 1742, the last year of his thirties, that the\nRoyal favour was marked by the grant of a pension of 400 livres\n(double florins) to Boucher with promise of early benefits to follow.\n\nTwo years afterwards it was raised to 600 livres.\n\nThis was the year that he painted the beautiful canvas of \"Diana\nleaving the Bath with one of her Companions,\" now at the Louvre. It\nwas also the year that saw his landscape, the \"Hamlet of Iss\u00e9\" at the\nSalon. This \"Hameau d'Iss\u00e9\" was to be enlarged for the Opera, proving\nhim to be decorator there, where he was arranging waterfalls,\ncascades, and the rest of the pretty business, without staying his\nhand from his art.\n\nAt forty Boucher has come into his kingdom. The ten years of these\nforties were to be a vast triumph for him. He was to produce\nmasterpiece after masterpiece. His art had caught the taste of the\nday. He was at the height of his powers. He had done great things--he\nwas to do greater. During these ten years of his forties he poured\nforth vivid and glowing works of sustained power and originality.\n\nWe have a picture of him as he was in the flesh at this time--the\npastel portrait by Lundberg, now at the Louvre--a gay, somewhat\ndissipated, handsomely dressed dandy of the time, smiling out of his\ncareless day, the debonnair man of fashion, the laughing eyes showing\nsigns of the night carousals, which were the rest from the prodigious\ntoil of this vital and forthright spirit.\n\nIt was in this our artist's fortieth year that the gifted old Cardinal\nFleury, who had guided the fortunes of France with rare skill, died,\nbroken by his ninety years and the blunders of the disastrous war that\nhe had so strenuously opposed; and Louis, essaying the strut of\nkingship, became king by act. His indolent character, unequal to the\nmighty business, his indeterminate will fretted by the set of\nquarrelling and intriguing rogues that he gathered about him as his\nministers, he fell into the habit that became his thenceforth, the\nonly thing to which he paid the tribute of constancy--he ruled France\nfrom behind pretty petticoats. He had early shown the adulterous blood\nof his great-grandfather; two, if not three, of five sisters of the\nnoble and historic house of De Nesle had yielded to his gadding fancy;\nthe youngest now ousted her sister De Mailly from the king's favour,\nwas publicly acknowledged as the king's mistress, and became Duchess\nof Ch\u00e2teauroux. Boucher painted her handsome being as a shepherdess in\none of his pastorals. She was no ordinary toy of a king. A woman of\ntalent, with hot ambitions for the king's majesty, fired with the\npride of race of the old French noblesse, it was during her short\nyears of ascendancy over the king that he roused from his body's\ntorpor and made an effort to reach the dignity and eminence befitting\nto the lord of a great and gallant people. He stepped forth awhile\nfrom his drunken bouts and manifold mean adulteries, and set himself\nat the head of the army in Flanders, and strutted it as conqueror.\n\nPoor Ch\u00e2teauroux only got the hate of the people for reward, Louis the\nhonours; for the people resented the public dishonour of her state.\n\nPower she found to be a dead-sea apple in her pretty mouth. The glory\nof it all, the splendours, were not the easily won delights for which\nshe had looked. She had to fight a duel, that never ended, with the\nking's witty, crafty, and scurrilous Prime Minister, the notorious\nMaurepas--and Maurepas willed that no woman should ever come between\nhim and the king--Maurepas who knew no mercy, no decency, no chivalry,\nno scruple. At Ch\u00e2teauroux's urging, Louis placed himself at the\nhead of the army; and France went near mad with joy that she had\nagain found a king. Crafty Maurepas urged on the business; the\nCh\u00e2teauroux suddenly realised his cunning glee--it separated her from\nthe king.\n\nOut of the whirl of things Boucher's fortune was ripening, little as\nhe might suspect it.\n\nHe was painting masterpieces that make his name live. To his fortieth\nyear belong the famed \"Birth of Venus,\" the \"Venus leaving the Bath,\"\nthe \"Muse Clio,\" the \"Muse Melpomene,\" and the three well-known\npastorals now at the Louvre--\"The Sleeping Shepherdess,\" the \"Nest,\"\n\n\nand the \"Shepherd and Shepherdesses.\" Of the many famous Venus-pieces\nthat his hand painted during these years it is not easy to write the\nlist. But having signed the \"Marriage of Love and Psyche\" at\nforty-one, he turned his experimental hand to the homely, realistic\nDutch style that was having a wide vogue, and painted the\n\"Dejeuner\"--a family of the prosperous class of the day at\nbreakfast--showing with rare charm the surroundings and home life of\nthe well-to-do of his time.\n\nAll goes well with Boucher. He changes into better quarters in the Rue\nde Grenelle-Saint-Honor\u00e9, where he lived for the next five years,\nuntil 1749; but his eyes are fixed upon a studio and apartments at\nthe old palace of the Louvre, though the hard intriguing of his\npowerful friends at Court on his behalf failed for some time. He had,\nindeed, to make another move before he arrived at his longed-for goal.\n\nPensions Boucher, like others, had found to be somewhat empty affairs;\nbut rooms at the Louvre were a solid possession eagerly sought after\nby the artists.\n\nIn this year of 1744 Boucher created a new fashion at the annual Salon\nby sending studies and sketches instead of finished pictures; and it\nset a value upon such things not before realised by artists, for\nsuccess was instant and loud.\n\nTowards the end of the next, Boucher's forty-second year, the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who was to take his leave of Paris,\ncommissioned four pictures to represent the day of a woman of fashion,\nand to be entitled \"Morning,\" \"Midday,\" \"Evening,\" and \"Night.\"\n\nBoucher painted one of these for him, now known as the \"Marchande de\nModes.\" The others were painted later, and all had a wide vogue as\nengravings. The correspondence has interest since it reveals Boucher's\nbusiness habits; he was paid for a picture on its delivery, and for\neach of these he was to receive 600 livres (double florins or\ndollars)--about a hundred and twenty pounds.\n\nIn an official document of the Director of Buildings to the king (or\nMinister of Fine Art, as we should say), written in this year of 1745,\nBoucher being forty-two, is a \"list of the best painters,\" in which\nBoucher is singled out for distinction as \"an historic painter, living\nin the Rue de Grenelle-Saint-Honor\u00e9, opposite the Rue des Deux-Ecus,\npupil of Lemoyne, excelling also in landscape, grotesques, and\nornaments in the manner of Watteau; and equally skilled in painting\nflowers, fruit, architecture, and subjects of gallantry and of\nfashion.\"\n\nNot so bad for dry officialdom; the critics could learn a lesson. For\nhe was nothing less. What indeed does he not do? and wondrous well!\nthis painter of the age.\n\nAnd the mighty rush of events is about to sweep him into further\nprominence; the very things which he probably passed by with a gay\nshrug are to enrich him, to help him to his highest fulfilment.\n\nPoor Ch\u00e2teauroux saw that she must lose the king's gadding favour in\nthe conflict with Maurepas unless she joined her lord, now with the\narmy. She realised full well that she had created the new Louis of\nAmbition--that her going must bring the people's hate to her. But she\ndared not lose the king. And she went. Maurepas had overdone his\njibings. The indiscretion at once rang through the land; became the\njest of the army--and Maurepas was not far from the bottom of the\nbusiness. The discreet indiscretion of covered ways between the king's\nlodgings and hers only added to the mockeries, and increased the\npeople's hate against, of course, the Ch\u00e2teauroux. Then upon a day in\nAugust the small-pox seized Louis at Metz; poor Ch\u00e2teauroux fought for\npossession of the king in the sick room, until his fear of\ndeath--Louis' sole piety--sent her packing--shrinking back in the\nhired carriage at each halting-place for change of horses, lest she\nshould be seen and torn from her place and destroyed by the populace.\n\nBut Louis recovered; Paris rang with bells at joy on his recovery, and\nhe entered the city amidst mad enthusiasm, hailed as The Well-Beloved.\n\nHe sent for the Ch\u00e2teauroux to find her dying, Maurepas having to\ndeliver the message of recall. She died suddenly and in great agony,\nswearing that Maurepas had poisoned her--died in the arms of her poor\ndiscarded sister, the De Mailly.\n\nBut this year of 1745 Boucher hears a mightier scandal that is to mean\nvast things to all France--and not least of all to Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE POMPADOUR\n\n\nA young bride had become the gossip of the rich merchant society of\nParis--that class that was ousting the old noblesse from power. She\nwas a beautiful, a remarkable woman; her wit was repeated in the\ndrawing-rooms, she had all the accomplishments; her charming\nname--Madame Lenormant d'Etioles.\n\nDraw aside the curtains of the past and we discover our little Jeanne\nPoisson--grown into this exquisite creature. It has come about in\nstrange fashion enough. The father--a scandalous fellow--having\nfingered the commissariat moneys in ugly ways to his own use, had been\nbanished for the ugly business. Nor is Jeanne's mother any better than\nshe should be; and the wags wink knowingly at the handsome and rich\nman of fashion, Monsieur Lenormant de Tournehem, who has been the\nfavoured gallant during the absence of the light-fingered Poisson.\n\nAnd, of a truth, Lenormant de Tournehem takes astonishing interest in\nthe little Jeanne--watching over her up-growing and giving her the\nbest of education at the convent, where she wins all hearts, and is\nknown as \"the little queen.\" The truth spoken with wondrous prophecy,\nif unthinkingly, as we shall see. Complacent Poisson came home, and\ntook the rich and fashionable, bland and smiling Lenormant de\nTournehem to his arms. Has he not wealth and estates? therefore as\nexcellent a friend for Poisson as for Madame Poisson. The girl Jeanne\nleaves the convent to be taught the accomplishments by the supreme\nmasters of France, the wits foregather at Madame Poisson's, and the\nbrilliant Jeanne is soon mistress of the arts--coquetry not least of\nall; has also the most exquisite taste in dress. Under all is a heart\ncold as steel; calculating as the higher mathematics. She has but one\nhindrance to ambition--her mean birth. Lenormant de Tournehem rids her\neven of this slur by making his nephew, Lenormant d'Etioles, marry\nher, giving the young couple half his fortune for dowry, and the\npromise of the rest when he dies--also he grants him a splendid\ntown-house, as splendid a country seat. And consequential\nself-respecting little Lenormant d'Etioles is lord of Etioles, amongst\nother seignories. So Jane Fish appears as Madame Lenormant d'Etioles,\nseductive, beautiful, accomplished, to whose house repair the new\nphilosophy, the wits, and artists. She has a certain sense of virtue;\nindeed openly vows that no one but the king shall ever come between\nher and her lord. But, deep in her heart, she has harboured a fierce\nambition--that the king shall help her to keep her bond. She puts\nforth all her gifts, all her powers, to win to the strange goal;\nconfides it to her worldly mother and \"uncle,\" Lenormant de Tournehem;\nfinds keen allies therein to the reaching of that strange goal. The\ndeath of the Ch\u00e2teauroux clears the way. At a masked ball the king is\nintrigued as to the personality of a beautiful woman who plagues him\nwith her art; he orders the unmasking. Madame Lenormant d'Etioles\nstands revealed, drops her handkerchief as by accident; the whisper\nruns through the Court that \"the handkerchief has been thrown!\" The\nking stoops and picks it up. A few evenings later she is smuggled into\nthe \"private apartments.\" She goes again a month later; in the morning\nis seized with sudden terror--she daren't go back to her angry lord\nlest he do her grievous harm; he will have missed her. The king is\ntouched; allows her to hide from henceforth in the secret apartments;\npromises the beautiful creature a lodging, her husband's banishment,\nand early acknowledgment as titular mistress--before the whole Court\nat Easter, says the pious Great One. But he has to join the army to\nplay the Conqueror at Fontenoy; and it is later in the year\n(September) before Madame d'Etioles is presented to the Court in a\nvast company and proceeds to the queen's apartments to kiss hands on\nappointment. Thus was Jeanne Poisson raised to the great aristocracy\nof France in her twenty-third year as Marquise de Pompadour.\n\nBoucher had been one of the brilliant group of artists of the\nd'Etioles' circle. That the Pompadour's influence had much effect upon\nhis position at Court for a year or two is unlikely; for she had to\nfight for possession of the king day and night, as the Ch\u00e2teauroux\nhad done, against the queen's party and the unscrupulous enmity of\nMaurepas. To set down Boucher's favour at Court to her is ridiculous.\n\nHe was painting for the queen's apartments at thirty-one when the\nPompadour was a school-girl of twelve. But in the year following her\nrise to power, Boucher painted four pictures for the large room of the\nDauphin, which were \"placed elsewhere\"; and, the year after that, he\nwas at work upon two pictures for the bedroom of the king at the\ncastle of Marly. It is likely enough that the Pompadour directed this\norder. She had almost immediately secured the office of the\nDirector-General of Buildings, which covered the direction of the\nroyal art treasures, for \"uncle\" Lenormant de Tournehem, who was also\na friend of the artist. And from this year it is significant that\nBoucher paints no more for the opposing camp of the Queen and Dauphin.\n\nHe was now giving all his strength to the \"Rape of Europa\" that he\npainted for the competition ordered by the Academy at the command of\nLenormant de Tournehem in the king's name, in which ten chosen\nAcademicians were to paint subjects in their own style for six prizes\nand a gold medal, to be awarded in secret vote by the competing\nartists themselves. Boucher won, by his amiable nature, the good-will\nof them all by proposing that they should so arrange as to share the\nprizes equally, and thus prevent any sense of soreness inevitable in\nthe losers.\n\nBut greatly as he won the good-fellowship of his fellow-artists by it,\nthis picture caused a murmur to rise amongst the critics who,\naforetime loud in his praise, now began to complain of his \"abuse of\nrose tints\" in the painting of the female nude. The fact was that\nDiderot and the men of the New Philosophy were turning their eyes to\nthe whole foundations upon which France was built, art as well as\nsociety, and were beginning to demand of art \"grandeur and morality in\nits subjects.\" They were soon to be clamouring for \"the statement of a\ngreat maxim, a lesson for the spectator.\" Diderot, with bull-like\ncourage, picked out the greatest, and turned upon Boucher, blaming him\nfor triviality.\n\nThe nations, weary of war, concluded the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in\nthe October of 1748. No sooner was peace concluded than Louis\nrelapsed into his old habit of dandified indolence and profligate\nease; and, putting from him his duties as the lord of a great people,\nhe gave himself up to shameless intrigues. He allowed the Pompadour to\nusurp his magnificence and to rule over the land. He yielded himself\nutterly, if sometimes sulkily, to her domination; and for sixteen\nyears she was the most powerful person at Court, the greatest force in\nthe state--making and unmaking ministers, disposing of office,\nhonours, titles, pensions. All political affairs were discussed and\narranged under her guidance; ministers, ambassadors, generals\ntransacted their business in her stately boudoirs; the whole patronage\nof the sovereign was dispensed by her pretty hands; the prizes of the\nChurch, of the army, of the magistracy could be obtained solely\nthrough her favour and good-will. Her energy must have been\nprodigious. Possessed of extraordinary talents and exquisite tastes,\nshe gave full rein to them, and it was in the indulgence of her better\nqualities that Destiny brought Boucher into the friendship of this\nwonderful woman. She became not only his patron but his pupil,\nengraving several of his designs.\n\nBut this, her sovereignty over the king, easy and light in its outward\nseeming, was a haggard nightmare to the calculating woman who had so\nlonged for it. She knew no single hour's rest from the night she won\nto the king's bed. She had to fight her enemies, secret and open, for\npossession of the king's will, day and night; and she fought--with\nrare courage. She won by consummate skill and unending pluck. She made\nherself an essential part of the king's freedom from care. The Court\nparty fought her for power with constant vigilance. Maurepas brought\nall his unscrupulous art, all his ironic mimicry, all his vile jibes\nand unchivalrous hatred to bear against her. He had made himself a\nnecessity to the king; and he never slept away a chance of injuring\nher. He knew no mercy, no nobility, no pity. He made her the detested\nobject of the people. With his own hands he penned the witty verses\nand epigrams that were sung and flung about the streets of Paris.\n\nBut she had an enemy more subtle than any at the Court--hour by hour\nshe had to dispute the king with the king's boredom. And it was in the\neffort to do so that she created her celebrated theatre in the\nprivate apartments, calling Boucher and others to her aid in the doing\nof it. Here the noblest of France vied with each other to obtain the\nsmallest part to play, an instrument in its orchestra, an invitation\nto its performances.\n\nBoucher left the Opera to become its decorator in 1748, and did not\nreturn until her death. For her, he also decorated her beautiful rooms\nat Bellevue. She bought at high prices many of his greatest\nmasterpieces.\n\nThe Pompadour's power so greatly increased that she openly took\ncommand of the king's will; dared and succeeded in getting his\nfavourite Maurepas banished; and herself took to the use of the kingly\n\"we.\" Her rascally father was created Lord of Marigny; her brother,\nwhom the king liked well and called \"little brother,\" was created\nMarquis de Vandi\u00e8res; her only child, Alexandrine, signed her name as\na princess of the blood royal, and would have been married to the\nblood royal had she not caught the small-pox and died. She amassed a\nprivate fortune, castles, and estates such as no mistress had dreamed\nof; and into them she poured art treasures that cost the nation\nthirty-six millions of money. She created the porcelain factory of\nS\u00e8vres, kept keen watch over the Gobelins looms, and founded the great\nMilitary School of St. Cyr amidst work that would have kept several\nstatesmen busy, and of deadly intrigues at Court that would have\nbroken the spirit of many a brilliant man.\n\nIt was in her hectic desire to keep the king from being bored that she\nstooped, and made Boucher stoop, to the employment of his high\nartistry in the painting of a series of indecent pictures wherewith to\ntickle the jaded desires of Boredom, and thereby gave rise to the\nwidespread impression that Boucher's art was ever infected by base\ndesign. But Boucher was, at his very worst, but a healthy animal; and\neven in these secret works for the king he did not reach so low as did\nmany an artist of more pious memory who painted with no excuse but his\nown pleasure.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the Pompadour has been blamed too much for this\nevil act, and too much forgotten for her splendid patronage of the man\nwho, under it and during these great years of his forties, produced a\nseries of masterpieces that place him in the foremost rank of the\npainters of his century. It is impossible to reckon the number of the\npastorals and Venus-pieces that his master-hand painted and loved to\npaint, during these the supreme years of his genius. It is significant\nthat they were painted during the years that saw the Pompadour in\nsupreme power.\n\nBoucher was so firmly established in 1750, his forty-seventh year,\nthat he moved into a new house in the Rue Richelieu, near the Palais\nRoyal. Disappointed in not receiving a studio and apartments at the\nLouvre, he was allowed to use a studio in the king's library. He was\nnow making money so easily that he was able to collect pictures and\nprecious stones and the gaily coloured curiosities that appealed to\nhis tastes.\n\nThe critics were becoming more and more censorious; and one of them\nhits true with the comment that in his pastorals his shepherdesses\nlook as if they had stepped over from the Opera and would soon be off\nagain thereto.\n\nIn his forty-eighth year Boucher's art was at its most luminous\nstage--his atmosphere clear and subtle and exquisitely rendered; his\nyellows golden; his whites satin-like and silvery; his flesh-tones\nupon the nude bodies of his goddesses unsurpassed by previous art. The\nbeauty of it all was not to last much longer.\n\nLenormant de Tournehem died suddenly in the November of 1751; the\nPompadour's brother, Abel Poisson de Vandi\u00e8res, was appointed\nDirector-General in his stead at the age of twenty-five--and soon\nafterwards, on the death of his father, created Marquis de Marigny--a\nshy, handsome youth, a gentleman and an honourable fellow, whom the\nking liked well, and against whom his sister's sole complaint was that\nhe lacked the brazen effrontery of the courtiers of the day. No man\ndid more for the advancement of the art of his time. A pension of a\nthousand livres falling vacant, the young fellow secured it for\nBoucher; and almost immediately afterwards, a studio becoming vacant\nat the Louvre owing to the death of Coypel, first painter to the king,\nBoucher came to his coveted home, eagerly moving in with his family as\nsoon as its wretched state could be put into repair.\n\nThe decoration of the new wing to the palace at Fontainebleau brought\nthe commission for the painting of the ceiling and the principal\npicture in the Council Chamber to Boucher, who had already decorated\nthe Dining-Room. This was the period of his painting the \"Rising\" and\nthe \"Setting of the Sun\" for the Pompadour, now in the Watteau\ncollection, two canvases that were always favourites with the painter,\nbitterly as they were assailed by the critic Grimm.\n\nHe was turning out so much work that it was impossible to give as much\ncare to his pictures as he ought. For he refused sternly, his life\nlong, to raise his prices; by consequence he had to create a larger\namount of work in order to meet his expenditure. It was about this\ntime that Reynolds, passing through Paris, went to visit him and found\nhim painting on a huge canvas without models or sketches. \"On\nexpressing my surprise,\" writes Reynolds, \"he replied that he had\nconsidered the model as necessary during his youth until he had\ncompleted his study of art, but that he had not used one for a long\ntime past.\"\n\nHe soon had not the time, not only to paint from nature but even to\ngive his pictures the work necessary to complete them. The feverish\nhaste which took possession of him in his frantic endeavour to meet\nthe vast demand for his pictures, and the eager efforts of his\nengravers to satisfy the public call for engravings after his works,\ngave him less and less leisure to joy in their doing. And his eyesight\nbegan to fail. His flesh-tints deepened to a reddish hue; and he\nstands baffled before his work, suspecting his sight, since what every\none cries out upon as being bright vermilion, he only sees as a dull\nearthy colour. Boucher has topped the height of his achievement; he\nhas to \"descend the other side of the hill.\" Boucher begins to grow\nold.\n\nIn Boucher's fifty-first year an ugly intrigue of the queen's party at\nCourt to sap the Pompadour's influence over the king by drawing away\nthe king's affections towards Madame de Choiseul-Romanet, a reckless\nyoung beauty of the Court, brought about a strange alliance. The Count\nde Stainville, one of the Pompadour's bitterest enemies, was shown the\nking's letter of invitation to his young kinswoman; and he, deeply\nwounded in his pride that his kinswoman should have been offered to\nthe king, went to the Pompadour and exposed the plot. A close\nalliance followed; and De Stainville thenceforth became her chief\nguide in affairs of state. It was at her instance that the king called\nhim to be his Prime Minister, raising him to the Duchy of Choiseul--a\nname he made illustrious as one of the greatest Ministers of France.\n\nIn his fifty-second year Boucher was appointed to the directorship of\nthe Gobelins looms, to the huge delight of the weavers and all\nconcerned with the tapestry factory. This was the year of his painting\nthe famous portrait of the Pompadour, to whom he several times paid\nthis \"tribute of immorality.\" For the Gobelins looms he produced many\nhandsome designs; and he was painting with astounding industry. But\nhis hand's skill began to falter. His art shows weariness in his\nsixtieth year, and sickness fell upon him, and held him in servitude\nnow with rare moments of respite. The critics, notoriously Diderot,\nwere now attacking him with shameless virulence. Boucher passed it all\nby; but he felt the change that was taking place in the public taste.\n\nThe ideas of the New Philosophy were infecting public opinion; the Man\nof Feeling had arisen in the land; and France, humiliated in war, and\nresenting the follies and the greed of her shameless privileged class,\nwas openly resenting it and all its works. Choiseul had planted his\nstrength deep in the people's party, and was come near to being its\ngod. His masterly mind had checked Frederick of Prussia to the North;\nand the nations, exhausted by the struggle, signed the Peace of Paris\nin 1763. Choiseul, with France at peace abroad, turned to the blotting\nout of the turbulent order of the Jesuits at home. Their attempt to\nend the Pompadour's relations with the king made this powerful woman\neager to complete his design; the chance was soon to come, and the\nOrder was abolished from France and its vast property seized by the\nstate.\n\nThe Pompadour lived but a short while to enjoy her triumph. Worn out\nby her superhuman activities, assailed by debt, she fell ill of a\nracking cough, dying on the 15th of April, 1764, in her forty-second\nyear, keeping her ascendancy over the king and the supreme power in\nFrance to her last hour. Death found her transacting affairs of state.\n\nLouis, weary of his servitude, had only a heartless epigram to cast\nat the body of the dead woman as she passed to her last resting-place.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE END\n\n\nThe death of the Pompadour robbed Boucher of a friend; but her\nbrother, Marigny, remained faithfully attached to the old artist, and\nseized every chance to honour him. On the death of Carle van Loo,\nBoucher, at sixty-two, was made first painter to the king, with all\nhis pensions and privileges that were consistent with this the supreme\nappointment in the art world.\n\nThere had been serious intention of making Boucher the head of the\nEcole des El\u00e8ves Proteg\u00e9s; he had the art of making himself liked and\nof inspiring the love of the arts. He was very popular with the\nstudents and artists, owing to his kindliness, his eagerness to render\nservice, his readiness to encourage the youngsters or to console them.\n\nWhen the riot took place, provoked by the Academicians by their award\nof the Prix de Rome in 1767, the students insulted the Academicians,\nbut hailed Boucher with enthusiastic applause. The reason was not far\nto seek. When a student came to the old master for advice he did not\n\"play the pontiff,\" and, scorning the false dignity of big phrases, he\ntook the brush in his hand and showed the way out of all difficulties\nby simplehearted example, despising rules, and putting himself out in\norder to make things clear to a young artist.\n\nHowever, the Academicians feared he would be an unorthodox master for\nyouth, and appointed another in his place.\n\nA long and serious illness thwarted his keen energies. Diderot was\ngiving himself up to outrageous violence against him. If the old\npainter exhibited at the Salon, Diderot fiercely assailed his art; if\nhe did not exhibit, Diderot as bitterly assailed him for his\nnegligences. Above all, he attacked Boucher in that he did not paint\nwhat Diderot would have painted--but could not. \"When he paints\ninfants,\" cries Diderot, \"you will not find one employed in a real act\nof life--studying his lesson, reading, writing, stripping hemp.\"\n\nPoor unfortunate infants! for whom Philosophy could find no happier\njoy in life than stripping hemp! Boucher was but an artist. He\npainted his generation as far as he could see it, and, with all his\nfaults and weaknesses, he never debauched his art with foreign and\nalien things that had no part in the nation's life; he painted fair\nFrance into his landscapes, not a make-believe land he did not know\nwith preposterous Greek ruins; and best of all, to his eternal honour,\nhe painted infants glad in their gladness to be alive, with no desire\nto send their happy little bodies to school, with no sickly ambition\nto make them into budding philosophers, with no thought of making them\npose and lie as Men of Feeling. He had no joy in setting their little\nbodies to toil--in making them \"teach a lesson to the spectator,\" in\nmaking them stoop their little shoulders to the \"picking of hemp.\"\n\nHe continued to paint as he had always painted--except that he painted\nless well. The wreath of roses was wilting on a grey head. The blood\njigged less warmly in the frail body. The features showed pallid--the\neyes haggard. The sight failed. The hand alone kept something of its\ncunning.\n\nHe went to Holland with his friend Randon du Boisset, but health\nshrank farther from him. Diderot had near spent his last jibe.\n\nIn 1768, Boucher's sixty-fifth year, the neglected queen went to her\ngrave. The king's grief and contrition and vows to amend his life came\ntoo late, and lasted little longer than the drying of the floods of\ntears over the body of his dead consort. A year later he was become\nthe creature of a pretty woman of the gutters, whom he caused to be\nmarried to the Count du Barry--the infamously famous Madame du Barry.\n\nBut neither the remonstrances of Choiseul with the king against this\nfurther degradation of the throne of France, nor his unconcealed scorn\nof the upstart countess, nor the dangerous enemy he made for himself\nthereby, signified now to Boucher, first painter to the king.\n\nBoucher was failing. His son was a prig and a disappointment. His two\nfavourite pupils, Baudoin and Deshayes, who had married his two girls,\ndied.\n\nTo the Salon of 1769 he sent his \"Caravan of Bohemians.\" It was his\nlast display. He had been going about for some time like a gaunt ghost\nof his former self, afflicted with all the ills inevitable to a life\nfeverishly consumed in work and the pursuit of pleasure.\n\nThey went to his studio at five of the clock one May morning, and\nfound him seated at his easel, before a canvas of Venus, dead, with\nthe paint-filled brush fallen out of his fingers.\n\nSo passed he away on the 30th of May 1770, in his sixty-seventh year.\n\nWhen Boucher died, the generation of which he was the limner was near\ncome to its violent end. The rosy carnivals and gay gallantries of his\nage gave way to the blood-stained romance and fierce tempest of the\nRevolution. The garrets of the old curiosity-shops received the\ndiscarded canvases of the master. His shepherds and shepherdesses were\nput to rout by the Romans of his pupil, citizen David. The old order\nwas brought into contempt and overthrown. And with it, Boucher's art,\nlike much that was gracious and charming and good in the evil thing,\nwent down also, and was overwhelmed for a while.\n\nFor a while only. For just as, out of the blood and terror of the\nRevolution, a real France arose, phnix-wise, from the ruin, and in\nbeing born, whilst putting off the vilenesses of the thing from which\nshe sprang, took on also to herself the gracious and winsome qualities\nthat place her amongst the most fascinating peoples of the ages; so\nBoucher has come into his kingdom again--the most gracious of painters\nthat the years have yielded."

                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n        a. One bed, or folding cot,\n        b. One oil stove,\n        c. One lamp,\n        d. Enough supplies of all kinds sufficient for six months,\n        e. Pots, pans, kettles, etc.\nIt is needless to say that positions in Manila and Iloilo were now at\na premium.\n\nWas it possible that teachers were to be sent to places where even the\nnecessaries of life could not be obtained! Was it possible that many\nwould be sent to places so remote that for six months no fresh\nsupplies could be gotten! A mass meeting was held at once, and a\ncommittee was appointed to send a cablegram to the Associated Press\npetitioning aid from the American people at large. Realizing what\nconsternation would be created throughout the United States by such a\nmessage, two of the teachers leaped into a carriage at the close of\nthe meeting and a few moments later were closeted with the chief\nexecutive of the department. As a result the committee was persuaded\nnot to send the cablegram to the Associated Press until by courtesy it\nhad been sent to the President. Of course, this diplomatic move tided\naffairs over and the teachers who had flatly refused to budge from\nManila now agreed to go on to their stations, being assured that\nwhatever action was best would be taken.\n\nThe day had come when we must separate. We were to enter an untried\nand an unknown field. It was fitting that we have a final joyous\nmeeting, so the best orchestra in the archipelago was engaged and we\n\"chased the hours with flying feet\" until dawn so that whatever might\ncome to us in that unknown future upon which we were entering each\nwould hold in pleasant memory our last evening together.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER III. - A DRAMA IN ACTUAL LIFE.\n\n\nAlmost every one heeded the warning to go to his station forearmed\nwith at least necessaries of life, but, as it had never fallen to the\nlot of the writer to cook, he refused to learn at that late day, so he\ntook no pot, no pan, no kettle, putting his future into the hands of\nan uncertain fate and relying upon the unknown hospitality of the\nFilipino.\n\nBacalod, the capital of the province of Occidental Negros, was our\ndestination. The second morning after leaving Manila, we awoke with\nthe \"Kilpatrick\" lying at anchor in a shallow bay. We were several\nmiles from the shore and nothing in sight indicated that we had\nreached a place of any importance. Late the night before we had been\nawakened by the loud, sharp ringing of the ship's bells, accompanied\nby the reversal of the engines and a general disturbance awaking the\ncrew. So our first impressions on coming on deck were that we had run\naground. But the captain assured us that everything was ship-shape and\nthat this was the nearest point of approach to Capiz, a town of\nconsiderable importance on the island of Panay, where a body of troops\nwas to embark for home. Not even the grass hut of a native was in\nsight. Search as we would, not a sign was seen of a stream flowing\ninto the sea, indicating the probable presence of a town. There was\nnot a sign of life of any kind save one lone column of thin, blue\nsmoke that arose from the side of a mountain miles away. One would\nhave thought that we were explorers of three hundred years ago lying\noff the shore of some unknown land.\n\nAfter breakfast the steam launch, together with all the boats, was\nlowered, and several of us who had determined to miss no opportunity\nto gather information about the islands took our places in the launch\nby the side of the ship's mate, and steamed away across the water with\na long line of boats strung out in the rear. We headed away toward a\ngroup of cocoanut trees, and about an hour later stepped ashore on a\npile of decayed coral rocks that extended some twenty or thirty feet\nout into the water, thus forming the only landing place of a town of\nseveral thousands of people and of considerable commercial importance.\n\nA few moments after we had landed, an army wagon drawn by a\nmagnificent pair of mules came up out of a tropical jungle along a\nnarrow road. We clambered into the wagon and were soon lost in the\ndepths of foliage from which we had just seen the vehicle emerge.\n\nLong waving bamboos with their plumy leafage hung over the road from\neach side, meeting and overlapping in the center until they formed an\narchway so dense that the tropical sun now high in the heavens\npenetrated it only at intervals. At times the wagon sank up to the\nhubs in the soft earth, and the muscles of the mules stood out like\nwhip-cords under the skin as they drew us forward.\n\nAt a sharp turn in the road we came upon the first division of troops\nthat was to embark for home. The look of joy upon their sun-browned\nfaces was inexpressible. Their work was done, and with elastic step\nand smiling faces they saluted us as they passed by. The reign of\nforce was at an end; it was going out with them; the reign of peace\nhad begun; it was coming in with us.\n\nIn the afternoon when we returned from the town the last of the troops\nhad arrived and, as we drove up, the bugle was sounding the call to\nsupper. We noticed native women mingling with the troops and, indeed,\na native woman was in constant attention waiting upon one of the\nsoldiers with whom we ate. Her clothes were clean, her hair was nicely\ncombed, and her general appearance was neat. She seemed to anticipate\nthe slightest wish of the soldier with whom she was. She brought him\nwater to drink, cleaned his plate after the meal and saw that his\nknife, fork, and spoon were put into his haversack.\n\nWe had now finished supper and the launch had returned for the last\nload of troops. The lieutenant in command of the company gave the\norder to \"fall in\"; the men shouldered their rifles and fell into\nline. \"Forward, march!\" called the lieutenant, and the column swept\nforward towards the boats. The women had until now restrained\nthemselves, but, as their husbands marched away never to return, their\nfeelings could no longer be restrained. One young woman of about\neighteen, who was leaning against a rock by the roadside sobbing, when\nher husband passed, leaped up in frenzy of passionate love and caught\nthe rifle from his shoulder. Her first impulse seemed to be to throw\nthe gun away, but suddenly realizing the futility of such an act she\nburst into tears, shouldered the rifle herself and marched on by his\nside. Another woman of more mature age threw her arms around the legs\nof a tall stalwart man, and drew him bodily from the line.\n\nBut the troops marched on and entered the boats. One woman who had\nbeen unnoticed before came down into the shallow water and caught hold\nof our last boat as if to prevent its leaving, while others stood\nmingling their sobs with the sounds of the wavelets as they broke on\nthe sands. As we passed away, an expectant mother, standing in bold\noutline against the twilight sky, threw up her hands in an agony of\ndespair and then sank upon the stones. The curtain had fallen upon a\ndrama in actual life deeper in pathos than any other we had ever seen\nor ever expected to see. Depth of passion, depth of love! Who can\nfathom the human heart?\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. - WHAT THE TEACHERS DID.\n\n\nThere is a remarkable sameness about the towns in the Philippines.\n\nThey all have a large open square about the middle of the town, around\nthree sides of which are Chinese stores, unless one side lies open to\nthe sea, and on the fourth is the great stone ecclesia. The streets\nrun at right angles to one another and divide up the town into\ncreditable squares.\n\nEverybody in the Philippines lives up-stairs, for the ground is so\nsoaked with water during the rainy season that it is a menace to\nhealth to live upon the ground floor. So even the poorest nippa hut\nis built upon stakes four or five feet above the ground.\n\nBacalod is a typical Philippine town. As we landed, a broad open\nsquare was spread out before us. Two sides of the square were lined\nwith two-story houses in which were Chinese stores below and Filipino\nhomes above. On the third side stood the great stone church in whose\nmassive tower the clock was striking the hour of four, while the\nfourth lay open to the sea that had borne us thither.\n\nWe landed, but it was in a method new to us and one not usually\nemployed by the traveling public.\n\nWhen our sail boat ran aground on the sandy bottom a hundred yards or\nmore from the shore, a crowd of Filipino men who were on the beach\nslowly rolled up their pantaloons and waded out to the rescue,--for\nthe money that was in it. The boat's crew elevated their trousers'\nlegs also and slided down into the water. Each of us then straddled\nthe neck of a Filipino standing in the water and was held by ankles to\nbe steadied while our biped mounts proceeded to the shore.\n\nWe were now on the ground and face to face with the situation. To give\nthe reader an idea of the actual conditions met by the first teachers\nwho went to the Islands, the following is copied from the instructions\ngiven us in Manila:\n    1. There shall be two sessions daily of all schools, and the\n    last hour of the morning session shall be devoted solely to\n    instructing the Filipino teachers.\n\n    2. In cases where teachers are sent to a town in which there\n    is no school-house, they are expected to secure the aid of the\n    people and have one built.\n\n    3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is\n    stopped.\n\n    4. All supplies must be kept under lock and key. In towns\n    where there is no case or box to lock the supplies in, and it\n    is also impossible to get the town council to furnish a case,\n    a requisition may be sent to Manila, and, if an appropriation\n    can be secured, one will be made and sent out.\n\nThus it can be easily seen that we were indeed pioneers. In many\nplaces no school-house was to be found, and in some cases it was even\ndifficult to get the town council to provide a case in which to keep\nthe supplies.\n\nThe work of the teachers was, in short; to \"make the English language\nthe basis of instruction in the public schools.\" On our arrival at\nBacalod two schools were found in progress, for some soldiers had been\ndetailed for the work here previous to our coming. One of these was\nfor boys and the other, for girls. Thus the work here had been in a\nmeasure simplified, but complications that had arisen at Talisay, one\nof the largest and richest towns on the island, demanded a change of\nteachers and the writer was assigned to the place as superintendent.\n\nHere an attempt had been made to start a school but it had failed\nignominiously and a system of education was to be put into operation\nfrom the very start.\n\nThe Filipinos are not strong advocates of co-education, so separate\nschools were to be started for the boys and the girls. The one for the\nboys was gotten well in hand before the one for the girls was\nattempted at all.\n\nA few days after reaching the town and securing a home the\npresidente of the town had it publicly announced that the following\nMonday morning at eight o'clock a public school for boys would be\nopened in a building that had been rented for the purpose by the\nmunicipal council. About the middle of the afternoon of the same day a\nman beat a little drum throughout all the streets of the town to call\nthe people out and the town clerk announced both in Spanish and in the\nnative language that this public school would begin at the time and\nplace mentioned above; that instruction would be free to all who came;\nthat the government would furnish all supplies; and that instruction\nwould be given in the English language. A native principal and\nassistants were employed and everything was ready to begin.\n\nThe official report of the result is as follows:\n    Boys' public school of Talisay, Negros, P. I., began November\n    4, 1901. Forty-three boys present at eight o'clock. Forty-one\n    of them knew \"good morning\" and \"good afternoon\" but do not\n    know the distinction between them. Two of them speak simple\n    Spanish. At eight forty-five, eight more, who had been\n    attending an early morning private school, came in together.\n\n    The books they brought were so varied and so different from\n    one another that it seemed impossible to bring any reasonable\n    degree of order out of such a chaos, and so, after struggling\n    vainly for about a week with the problem, the superintendent\n    by one fell stroke removed everything in use and put in a\n    uniform system, and from that day on the English language has\n    been the basis of instruction in the public schools of\n    Talisay. The work was of necessity very slow at first, but by\n    the end of a year two schools were going nicely and a number\n    of the brightest boys and girls had made really excellent\n    progress.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER V. - A \"BAILE.\"\n\n\nNot long after the arrival of our party at Bacalod we received an\ninvitation to a \"baile\" given in our honor by the inhabitants of\nSilay, a town some ten or twelve miles up the northern coast and one\nnoted for its social life. The invitation was accepted with pleasure,\nand about the middle of the afternoon on the day appointed we were\nclad in the immaculate white of the tropics and steaming away up the\ncoast on board a launch sent for our conveyance. Twilight was still\nlingering on the path of day when we anchored just off shore at the\ntown. A row-boat containing the officials of the city came out to meet\nus and, in due season, we were ushered into a spacious drawing-room\nfilled almost to overflowing with the \u00e9lite of the town. The \u00e9lite of\ntowns in the Philippines speak Spanish, and, as only one or two of our\nparty could at that time boast of more than a formal acquaintance with\nthe Castilian tongue, the exchange of ideas that evening between us\nand the Filipinos was of necessity not very rapid.\n\nThe necessity of easy communication between us was rendered somewhat\nless indispensable by the announcement of supper as soon as we were\nrested from our trip. When we had taken our places at the table a\nyoung Filipino about twenty-five years of age arose and gave a lengthy\ntoast to the recent union of the Philippines with the United States.\n\nBut as we Americans were unable to scale the dizzy heights of his\nclimaxes or sink to the depths of his pathos, we forewent the\npleasures of his oratory and turned our attention to the savory odor\nof lamb, chicken, and roast pig that came slyly stealing up our\nnostrils to send us nerve dispatches about the gastronomic delights of\nour not far distant future.\n\nAt last the toast was ended and the world-wide soup ushered in a long\ntrain of things good to eat, served in a style better fitted to the\ndelights of the appetite than to the formalities of dinners, for, as\nsoon as the pleasant task of one dish was completed by any one, the\nnext was served him at once regardless of the progress made by the\nothers at the table.\n\nThe last course was dulce. The new-comers to the Philippines will\nnot be long in making the acquaintance of this dish, and at all\nmeetings, both public and private, where eatables are served, it\nperforms an important part. It is anything sweet, and it may vary all\nthe way from an india-rubber-like black mixture of cocoanut milk and\ndirty sugar to a really toothsome and respectable confection. No\nmatter of what materials a dish is composed, just so long as it is\nsweet, it is dulce.\n\nAfter paying our respects to this last course, we arose from the table\nand entered a great rectangular room from the center of whose ceiling\nhung a large glass chandelier, a mass of shimmering crystals. In the\nchairs around the room were the wealth, the youth, and the beauty of\nthe town.\n\nThe first and also the last number of every Filipino dance of any\nformality is the \"rigodon.\" The dancers are arranged in a square, or\nquadrangle according to the number participating, and are then led\nthrough a tangled maze of figures that so utterly bewilders the novice\nthat he sinks into his chair at the end of the dance wondering how it\nall came to pass.\n\nWe Americans breathed a sigh of relief when the \"rigodon\" ended, and\nmustered fresh courage for social conquests in the waltz that was now\nbreathing forth from the trembling strings. My companion in the first\ndance had been the young lady by whose side I had sat at dinner. But\nit now became necessary to search for another, so I prudently waited\nto see how partners were chosen, and made no mistake when a few\nmoments later I faced one of the most luscious looking se\u00f1oritas on\nthe opposite side of the room and offered her my arm. My eyes must\nhave told the story that my lips could not utter in Spanish, for she\nsmiled upon me sweetly, arose, and put her hand upon my shoulder. My\narm encircled her waist and I began to waltz. Unfortunately my\ncompanion did not follow, but began to hop up and down in a manner\nmost distressing. Supposing the attack to be only temporary, I paused\nand, much to my relief, she soon showed signs of recovery; and in the\ncourse of time she came to a standstill looking up into my face in an\ninquiring sort of way, apparently wondering why St. Vitus had not paid\nhis respects to me also. A second attempt to follow the music met with\nresults similar to the first, and during the third attempt, which\nseemed to be trembling on the verge of a failure, St. Vitus let go my\ncompanion and seized me with such vigor that she, who was small even\nfor a Filipino, was gathered up bodily and taken around the room at\nsuch a pace that her toes touched the floor only at far distant\nintervals.\n\nAt this point my devotion to the shrine of Terpsichore ceased from\nforce of circumstances and I seated myself in one of the most\ncomfortable chairs in sight that I might carry out a previously formed\nplan to study the Filipino somewhat critically as he appears in\nsociety.\n\nThe first thing that impressed me as the dancers passed up and down\nthe room was the flash of diamonds. Nearly every woman in the room had\non a brooch that flashed the colors of the rainbow at every turn.\n\nAlmost all of them wore one or more rings that showed up brilliantly\nunder the chandelier. Many of the men too, especially the young men,\nwore gems that appeared to be exquisite. A closer inspection showed\nthat some of the gems had flaws and others were of a poor color, but\nno one would have denied that, taken as a whole, it was a really\nbeautiful display.\n\nThe dress of the ladies was richly colored. Many of their skirts were\nof silk covered with hand embroidered flowers, and their filmy pina\nwaists and broad collar pieces were rich with needle-work. They all\nwore a kind of heelless velvet slipper, very common as a dress shoe in\nthe Philippines, or high-heeled patent leather shoes with neatly\nfitting black stockings.\n\nThe men were dressed in white coats and white pantaloons or black\ncoats and white pantaloons. White shirts and collars, together with\nall sorts and styles of cravats and low-cut patent leather shoes with\nhighly colored socks completed their dress.\n\nIt was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money;\nthat they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a\ntable loaded with good things was a fact to which all of us were\nenthusiastic witnesses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VI. - A SKETCH OF LIFE IN THE PHILIPPINES.\n\n\nHouse-keeping in the Philippines presents some interesting phases. Our\nclub of American officials decided to run a mess, so we employed a\ncook and a house boy, then each of us provided himself with a personal\nservant, making a total of six servants for four men--it takes about\nthis proportion of servants to live in any sort of comfort in the\nPhilippines--and launched ourselves boldly upon the sea of domestic\neconomy. But there were shoals ahead of us, for the question of\nregulating servants is one of no small importance in the Philippines,\nand one of its most disadvantageous features is the long chain of\ndependents that usually attends it.\n\nWe gave the cooks so much a day with which to buy supplies in the\nlocal market, for our own table, making him render a daily list of\nexpenditures, and a fixed amount besides to purchase rice and fish for\nhimself and the other servants. Of course, if they wished to vary\ntheir diet and get chicken and fresh pork, which could be had at far\ndistant intervals, it was wholly a matter of their option, but the\nallowance was made on the basis of so much rice and fish a day for\neach. This allowance was about fifteen cents a day in Spanish coin per\nservant.\n\nThus far all was well. We had agreed to give the cook eight dollars a\nmonth in Spanish money, thinking that good wages would procure good\nservice, but the visions of affluence that floated before him on such\nfloods of wealth were so alluring that they drew him from the kitchen\nto the cooler veranda. In less than a week he had employed an\nassistant at four dollars a month; in less than another week that\nassistant had employed him an assistant at two dollars a month; in\nless than another week that assistant to the assistant had employed\nhim an assistant at the princely salary of fifty cents a month; and\nfrom fear that the chain of dependents would end only by our having\nthe whole Filipino race attached to our culinary force, we broke up\nhouse-keeping and went boarding again, choosing that as the less of\nthe two evils.\n\nOur house furnishings were almost wholly Philippine. The table ware\nand the food on the table came from the ends of the earth. The knives\nand forks were made in Germany, the plates were manufactured in\nEngland, the glass ware and table cloth, in the United States. The\noatmeal and flour came from the United States also. The butter came\nfrom Australia, the rice from China, the salt from Russia, and the\nother eatables from sources about as various as their separate names.\n\nSwitzerland furnished the condensed milk and Illinois the canned\ncream. Nearly all of the canned fruit bore labels from Spain.\n\nThus it can easily be seen that life in the Philippines, if lived\naccording to American ideals, is dependent upon a highly developed and\nhighly complex commerce. However, the difficulties of transportation\nand the restriction of large stocks of merchandise to Manila and some\nhalf a dozen other towns, make so great a difference between country\nlife and city life that a short comparison of the two will not be out\nof place, and life in Manila may well be taken as being fairly typical\nof the latter.\n\nLife in Manila is pleasant, but expensive. It is pleasant from the\nfact that it is not only the capital but also metropolis of the\narchipelago. Thus the combination of wealth and high official position\nhas given to Manila a society of the highest and most refined type.\n\nThe process of beautifying and improving the city which is constantly\ngoing on bids fair to give us at no distant day a city of which we may\nwell be proud.\n\nBut let him who intends living well in Manila on a small income bid\nfarewell at once to so idylic a dream, for it costs much to live well\nthere. In the city of Manila one can get almost anything he wishes,\nbut it must be paid for at the price it commands. Especially in the\ncase of eatables, this price is by no means small, because to the\nfirst cost of articles must in most cases be added the expense of\ndistant shipment from American, European, or Australian ports, and not\ninfrequently the cost of long refrigeration must also be taken into\nconsideration. But, expensive though it is, it is very pleasant to\nlive there and those who have once enjoyed it often wish again to\nquaff the cup of its delights.\n\nIn strong contrast to this pleasant life is the life of the quiet\nlittle hamlet away in the distant islands. Indeed, the Filipino from\nthe distant town, who by some good fortune has been to Manila, or, by\na coup de main, has studied in one of the Manila colleges, is looked\nup to in a true hero-worshiping attitude by all who either know him or\nhear of his fame. Life in such a place is one long state of harmless\ninactivity. Not a wave of trouble from the great outer world ever\ndisturbs its peaceful repose. One lounges forever in an air of\nindolent ease and extreme aversion to anything approaching what might\nbe called a respectable effort.\n\nOne arises in the morning about the time the sun's first rays silver\nthe top leaves of the cocoanut trees and then stirs around until nine\nor ten o'clock, when it is found expedient to avoid a further exposure\nto the sun. From then until about five o'clock in the afternoon it is\nbest to take things as they come, even though one of those things be a\nFilipino dinner. But then you may have your vehiclo attached to a\nyoung bull with a ring in his nose and go for a drive. If it is the\ndry season you will probably enjoy the drive unless you object to the\nfrequent clouds of dust swept along by the evening wind. If it is in\nthe rainy season your pleasure will depend to a considerable extent\nupon how wet you get; but, whether the season be wet or dry, your\npleasure will be regulated largely by the state of harmony existing\nbetween the driver and the bull.\n\nIn these quiet secluded nooks successive generations of Filipinos are\nborn, reared, grow old and die in an even chain of events broken only\nby the occasional erection of a new grass house on the identical spot\nwhere its predecessors have stood for ages. The son lives in the house\nof his father, cultivates the same few square feet of soil planted in\nedible roots, climbs the same cocoanut trees, follows the same winding\npath down to the stream, pounds rice in the same mortar and with the\nsame stick that his ancestors have used from time unremembered, and,\nin case of illness, curls up on a grass mat in a corner of the room\nuntil he dies or by some good fortune recovers. Beyond this narrow\nhorizon he never looks. So narrow and contracted is the life that the\nlanguages of two towns a few miles apart are so different that one\nwould scarcely recognize them as belonging to the same race of people.\n\nSuch are the two extremes of life in our new far Eastern provinces:\nthe one is active, progressive, and cosmopolitan; the other, inactive,\ndecadent, and narrow; but, whether one enjoys the first or endures the\nsecond, there comes to him after leaving a longing to lounge again in\ntropic airs and listen to the lullaby of the winds among the palms.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VII. - THE FILIPINO AT HOME.\n\n\nAs one enters a Filipino sitting-room for the first time, there is one\nfeature in the arrangement of the furniture that impresses itself upon\nhim at once, and it may be stated without fear of serious\ncontradiction that this same peculiar feature in its arrangement will\ncontinue to face him, as he enters different homes, about as certainly\nas he crosses the threshold.\n\nThe arrangement referred to is that of one large mirror, one settee,\nand some ten or a dozen chairs that appear to have had a certain\norderly affection for one another. The mirror is hung upon one of the\nlarge interior parts of the house about four feet above the floor. The\nwooden houses in the Philippines are built by setting large posts\nupright into the ground, extending into the air from twenty to thirty\nfeet. Cross timbers are fastened to these upright posts about eight or\nten feet above the ground and then not sawed off even with the posts,\nbut allowed to extend beyond them each way. The framework of the house\nis built upon these extending cross timbers, a style of building by\nwhich these large upright posts are left standing out on the inside of\nthe room from one to three feet from the walls. It is on that one of\nthese posts most nearly opposite the door that the mirror always finds\nits place. Immediately beneath the mirror is the settee; and the\nchairs are arranged in two parallel lines facing one another and at\nright angles with the ends of the settee. However odd this arrangement\nmay appear to one when he first enters a Filipino drawing-room, there\nare two things to be said in its favor. In the first place, it places\nyou face to face with the person with whom you are conversing so that\nyou can watch him,--a matter of no small moment in the Philippines. In\nthe next place, it enables you to give one of the young ladies a\nsheep's-eye in the mirror while the others present are left where\nMoses was in our much abused conundrum.\n\nThe size of the residence and the quality of its furnishings depends\nupon the wealth of the owner. But there is so vast a difference\nbetween the mode of life of the highest class and the tao, or lowest\nclass, that it is well to speak of them separately, and the great\nmiddle class of Filipinos can easily be imagined to occupy the\nintervening ground.\n\nThe rich Filipino's house is usually of wood built upon a wall of\nstone or brick from ten to fifteen feet high. The floors are kept\nhighly polished in his hallway, dressing-room, and bed-rooms. There\nare, of course, no fire-places in any of the rooms, but on some\noccasions something is needed to dry the rain-soaked atmosphere, for\neven in the dry season it has been seen to rain for five successive\ndays and nights without the cessation of a moment.\n\nA long chain of dependents is attached to the household of the rich\nFilipino. The master has his special body servant to be present at all\ntimes to do his master's bidding, in short, to be the visible\nmechanism of his master's volition. So, too, the lady of the house has\nher servant woman to do the slightest bidding of her ladyship. Then\nthere is the cook who is almost invariably a man, a house boy or two,\nand the coachman. These functionaries, with their assistants and\nassistants to the assistants, together with a servant or two for the\nexclusive service of the children, complete the economic household.\n\nSuch a family has an abundance of rice and wheat bread, also of\nchicken and fish with occasional fresh beef. They have also a good\ndeal of dulce. They regularly serve wine and frequently serve beer\non their tables.\n\nIn strong contrast with this mode of life is that of the tao. His\ndiet consists almost wholly of rice and small uncleaned fish boiled\ntogether. As a rule knife, fork, plate, and spoon find no place in his\nhousehold. The rice and fish are boiled in a pot and then allowed to\ncool in the same vessel or poured out to cool in a large earthen or\nwooden bowl. Then Mr. Tao together with Mrs. Tao and all the young\nTaos squat on their heels around the mixture and satisfy that\nintangible thing called the appetite. They do not use chop sticks as\nthe Chinese do, but the rice and fish are caught in a hollow formed by\nthe first three fingers of the right hand. The thumb is then placed\nbehind the mass. It is raised up and poised before the mouth, with a\nskill coming from the evolution of ages, when a contraction of the\nmuscles of the thumb throws the mass into the mouth with a skill that\nis marvelous to any but a Filipino. To judge from the most reliable\ninformation, the poorest class do not have an abundance of food,\nalthough it would seem that such a condition of things would be\nwell-nigh impossible. However, in a census of one hundred school\nchildren there were found six boys and four girls who declared that\nthey had never had enough to eat, and the native teacher stated that\nthis was probably true.\n\nThe wide gulf between the tao and the rich man is filled by the\ngreat middle class of Filipinos.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VIII. - VISIT TO A LEPER COLONY.\n\n\nNot far from our town was a leper colony and the first Saturday that\ncould be spared was set aside for a trip to the place. It happened\nthat none of the other Americans were at leisure on this particular\nmorning, but, rather then delay the trip or miss it altogether, the\nwriter, armed with a revolver, started out alone.\n\nThe road had been described so accurately by one who was supposed to\nknow it that it was deemed well-nigh impossible to miss the way. The\nmain highway was followed to the point where the by-path supposed to\nlead to the settlement turned off through some bamboo thickets and a\nlow tropical wood. This path led straight away towards the sea-coast\nwhere the houses of the colony were said to stand in a cocoanut grove\nby the beach.\n\nUpon arriving at the settlement, a very inhospitable reception was\nreceived from a mangy cur that growled and showed a very uninviting\nset of sharp, white teeth behind his snarling lips. The growling of\nthe dog had attracted the attention of an old man who, with age-bent\nback, was pounding rice in a mortar about fifty yards away. He turned\nslowly around and, upon seeing an intruder into the primitive quiet of\nthe place, gave a sharp, far-reaching call. The sound had scarcely\nrung through the grove when from about a dozen of the little grass\nhouses dotted here and there fifteen or twenty men armed with bolos\ncame out and gathered around the old man. A sense of my danger flashed\nupon me. Three miles from town and alone in a tropical jungle, I could\nbe almost instantly overcome by this band of bolo-men, and the only\nreport that would ever reach my people would be that I had\n\"disappeared.\" Of course, attack was by no means certain, but the\npotentiality of the situation was thrilling. A drawn revolver and the\ngleaming of its shining barrel had the effect of stopping the men, who\nseemed to be hesitating as to a course of action, until a somewhat\ndignified retreat was made to an open space in the rear from where a\nless dignified and a more hasty retreat began which did not stop short\nof Bacalod.\n\nEnough had been seen, however, even in this short visit, to give\nconvincing proof that the settlement visited was no colony of lepers;\nso, that afternoon two servant boys being taken as guides and\ninterpreters, another attempt was made to reach the goal desired.\n\nThis attempt was successful, and, after about two hours of walking, a\nlittle cluster of grass huts snugly hidden by the sea-coast came into\nview. As we approached, one would have thought it a gala-day. Some few\nchildren, apparently from six to thirteen years of age, almost wholly\nnude, were romping and playing in the open space around which the huts\nstood, and no one would ever have thought that any cloud so horrible\nas leprosy could hover over a place apparently so happy.\n\nBy the side of the path as we passed was a man and his wife setting\nout potato plants. His hands were so puffed and his fingers so short\nthat he could scarcely use them, but he was working along as best he\ncould. His wife's feet were so swollen and twisted that she walked\nonly with the greatest difficulty. We passed them by and entered the\nopen space above referred to.\n\nThe children now saw us, and those of them who could darted away like\nfrightened rabbits, each to his own burrow. An old man who was sitting\nin the warm afternoon sun on the little bamboo platform before his hut\nwas aroused from his lethargic repose by the scampering away of the\nchildren. He arose, trembling upon his tottering limbs, all drawn and\ntwisted, and hobbled away into his hut.\n\nThe children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at\nthe doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of\nthe settlement. In a few moments we were surrounded by a circle of\nhuman beings at once so repulsive and so pitiable that its graphic\nvividness can never be accurately portrayed.\n\nThe old man referred to above, having put on a pair of snow-white\npantaloons, appeared now at the doorway of his hut, followed a few\nmoments later by his wife who had evidently clothed herself in the\nbest raiment she had. At a call from the old man, all the men, women,\nand children in the settlement came out of their huts and stood in a\nline before us. The old man was spokesman and in his native visayan\ntongue made a heart-rending appeal for aid which we were powerless to\ngive. Attention was called to a leper woman, apparently about\ntwenty-five years of age, whose face had been attacked by the disease\nand whose appearance was truly pathetic. Upon her hip was a child\nabout a year and a half old and, strange to say, the child showed as\nyet no signs whatever of the disease.\n\nWhat an indissoluble enigma is life! Here in a little cluster of grass\nhuts in a secluded nook of a secluded island of an all but secluded\narchipelago was gathered together a little community of wretched\nnatives, driven by their loathsomeness from association with others\neven of the same half-savage race. Yet here, men and women loved and\nwere married, by mutual trust if not by law, and children were born of\nthe union to live forever under the unspeakable horror that\novershadowed the unfortunate parents. Love, hatred, sorrow, and\njoy--every passion that enters into the complex structure of the human\nheart even here, in this scene of sadness and despair, was playing\napparently as freely as where misfortune and disease had never crossed\nthe portals of life.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER IX. - A \"HIKE.\"\n\n\nWe were lounging lazily in our hammocks at Jimamaylan one evening in\nApril. Supper was just ended, and the soldiers in the post were\ncollected in groups here and there spinning yarns to pass away the\ntime, when a Filipino clad only in a loin cloth came down the street\nat a steadily swinging run and stopped in front of the sentry. He\nbrought the announcement that a band of ladrones had just burned a\nsugar mill and were advancing to sack a barrio about fifteen miles\naway.\n\nThe invitation of the commanding officer to go on a \"hike\" was eagerly\naccepted, and, in ten minutes after the message was given, the troops\nwere on the march followed by two adventurous pedagogues.\n\nDarkness was just closing in as we left the town, but a resplendent\ntropic moon soon made the night almost as brilliant as the day. The\ntrail we followed led over rough and rocky country. Sometimes for a\ndistance of a mile or more we passed over barren wastes of volcanic\nslag poured out in anger by some peak whose convulsions have long\nsince ceased. Again we would descend into a tropical jungle from the\ndense foliage of which the ladrones could have leaped at any moment,\nhad they known of our coming, and annihilated our little band. We\nforded rapid streams with the water at our breasts, and halted only\nonce in that rapid march of fifteen miles.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the town we met a man who was standing\nguard against a surprise by the ladrones. Nothing could well have been\nmuch more grotesque and nothing could much better illustrate the\nabsolutely primitive condition of the Filipinos in the interior of the\nislands than the appearance of this guard. A pair of knee pants, a\nconical grass hat, and a hemp shirt formed his entire apparel. A long\nflat wooden shield, a bolo, and a long bamboo spear with a sharp,\nflat, iron point, completed his equipment for battle.\n\nHere stood the first and the twentieth centuries side by side. The\nFilipino who had advanced only a stage beyond the condition of\nprimitive man with his knife, spear, and wooden shield, stood side by\nside with the American soldier, a representative of modern life with\nhis magazine rifle, his canteen, his knapsack,--with every article of\nhis clothing made to give him the highest possible efficiency as the\nunit of a military organization.\n\nA few yards farther on we met another guard equipped similarly to the\nfirst. Upon reaching the town, news had just been received that a\ndetachment of troops from another post had intercepted the ladrones\nand fought a skirmish with them. The ladrones had escaped and we set\nout in pursuit of them on a chase wilder than a Quixotic dream. We\nwound our way into the mountains behind the town, inquiring at every\ngrass hut we passed whether the band of ladrones had passed that way,\nbut only once was even a trace of them found. Then it was learned that\nat a certain place they had separated into groups of three or four and\ngone glimmering through the dream of things that were. This place was\nin a secluded nook of the mountains where in years gone by some\nadventurous Spaniard had erected a primitive water mill to grind his\nsugar-cane. We had now marched about twenty miles and the feet of the\npedagogues were a mass of blisters. They had reached the point where\nthat form of military maneuvering called \"hiking\" ceased to possess\nany alluring charms. So a native was persuaded to come out of his lone\nmountain hut and hitch up his carabao and cart. He was then made to\nget on the carabao's back, while the aforesaid pedagogues lay down on\nthe sugar-cane pulp that had been put into the body of the cart, and\nthe driver was instructed to start for the post we had left hours\nbefore, and not to stop until he got there. Being uncertain but that\nsome of the ladrones would learn of our having left the body of troops\nand would try the metal of our steel, we at first agreed that neither\nof us should go to sleep, but it was later decided that probably the\ndriver had no greater desire to cross the Styx than his passengers had\nand that in case of danger he would awaken us, so both took a revolver\nin each hand, stretched out supinely and went to sleep.\n\nSuch a sleep! The rough jolting of the cart over an almost impassable\nroad was never enough to break the spell of slumber. When we awoke the\nblazing tropic sun was past the midday mark of morning, shining full\ninto our unprotected and well-nigh blistered faces.\n\nA pack of dogs were heralding our approach to a little village at the\nfoot of the mountains where ponies were procured to take us back to\nthe post.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he insists, \"have stood the test of ages; and the plant\nevery where retained its name and credit: and one of our good\nherbarists, who had seen a wonderful case of a swoln spleen, so big, and\nhard as to be felt with terror, brought back to a state of nature by it\"\n\n(p. 37). The greatest portion of Hill's concluding section combines\nadvertisement for the powder medicine he was himself manufacturing at a\nhandsome profit together with a protest against competing apothecaries:\n\"An intelligent person was directed to go to the medicinal herb shops in\nthe several markets, and buy some of this Spleen-wort; the name was\nwritten, and shewn to every one; every shop received his money, and\nalmost every one sold a different plant, under the name of this: but\nwhat is very striking, not one of them the right\" (p. 42).\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis did not cease to be printed after Hill's in\n1766, but continued to issue from the presses into the nineteenth\ncentury. A good example of this is the tome by John Reid, physician to\nthe Finsbury Dispensary in London, Essays on Insanity, Hypochondriasis\nand Other Nervous Affections (1816), which summarizes theories of the\nmalady. A bibliographical study of such works would probably reveal\na larger number of titles in the nineteenth century than in the previous\none, but by this time the nature and definition of hypochondria had\nchanged significantly.\n\nIf John Hill's volume is not an important contribution in the history of\nmedicine, it is a lucid and brief exposition of many of the best ideas\nthat had been thought and written on the hyp, with the exception of his\nuninhibited prescribing of herbal medicines as cure-alls. An\nunderstanding of this disease is essential for readers of neoclassical\nEnglish literature, especially when we reflect upon the fact that some\nof the best literature of the period was composed by writers whom it\nafflicted. It is perhaps not without significance that the greatest poet\nof the Augustan age, Alexander Pope, thought it necessary as he lay on\nhis deathbed in May 1744 to exclaim with his last breath, \"I never was\nhippish in my whole life.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. I. - The NATURE of the DISORDER.\n\n\nTo call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and cruel. It\nis a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by thickened\nand distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver, and other\nparts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick scarce knows\none more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\n\nThe blood is a mixture of many fluids, which, in a state of health, are\nso combined, that the whole passes freely through its appointed vessels;\nbut if by the loss of the thinner parts, the rest becomes too gross to\nbe thus carried through, it will stop where the circulation has least\npower; and having thus stopped it will accumulate; heaping by degrees\nobstruction on obstruction.\n\nHealth and chearfulness, and the quiet exercise of mind, depend upon a\nperfect circulation: is it a wonder then, when this becomes impeded the\nbody looses of its health, and the temper of its sprightliness? to be\notherwise would be the miracle; and he inhumanly insults the afflicted,\nwho calls all this a voluntary frowardness. Its slightest state brings\nwith it sickness, anguish and oppression; and innumerable ills follow\nits advancing steps, unless prevented by timely care; till life itself\ngrows burthensome.\n\nThe disease was common in antient Greece; and her physicians understood\nit, better than those perhaps of later times, in any other country; who\nthough happy in many advantages these fathers of the science could not\nhave, yet want the great assistance of frequent watching it in all its\nstages.\n\nThose venerable writers have delivered its nature, and its cure: in the\nfirst every thing now shews they were right; and what they have said as\nto the latter will be found equally true and certain. This, so far as\npresent experience has confirmed it, and no farther, will be here laid\nbefore the afflicted in a few plain words.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. II. - Persons Subject to it.\n\n\nFatigue of mind, and great exertion of its powers often give birth to\nthis disease; and always tend to encrease it. The finer spirits are\nwasted by the labour of the brain: the Philosopher rises from his study\nmore exhausted than the Peasant leaves his drudgery; without the benefit\nthat he has from exercise. Greatness of mind, and steady virtue;\ndetermined resolution, and manly firmness, when put in action, and\nintent upon their object, all also lead to it: perhaps whatever tends to\nthe ennobling of the soul has equal share in bringing on this weakness\nof the body.\n\nFrom this we may learn easily who are the men most subject to it; the\ngrave and studious, those of a sedate temper and enlarged understanding,\nthe learned and wise, the virtuous and the valiant: those whom it were\nthe interest of the world to wish were free from this and every other\nillness; and who perhaps, except for this alloy, would have too large a\nportion of human happiness.\n\nThough these are most, it is not these alone, who are subject to it.\n\nThere are countries where it is endemial, and in other places some have\nthe seeds of it in their constitution; and in some it takes rise from\naccidents. In these last it is the easiest of cure; and in the first\nmost difficult.\n\nBeside the Greeks already named, the Jews of old time were heavily\nafflicted with this disease; and in their descendants to this day it is\noften constitutional: the Spaniards have it almost to a man; and so have\nthe American Indians. Perhaps the character of these several nations may\nbe connected with it. The steady honour, and firm valour of the\nSpaniard, very like that of the ancient Doric nation, who followed the\nflute not the trumpet to the field; and met the enemy, not with shouts\nand fury, but with a determined virtue: it is the temper of the\nHypochondriac to be slow, but unmoveably resolved: the Jew has shewn\nthis mistakenly, but almost miraculously; and the poor Indian, untaught\nas he is, faces all peril with composure, and sings his death-song with\nan unalter'd countenance.\n\nAmong particular persons the most inquiring and contemplative are those\nwho suffer oftenest by this disease; and of all degrees of men I think\nthe clergy. I do not mean the hunting, shooting, drinking clergy, who\nbear the tables of the great; but the retir'd and conscientious; such as\nattend in midnight silence to their duty; and seek in their own cool\nbreasts, or wheresoever else they may be found, new admonitions for an\nage plunged in new vices. To this disease we owe the irreparable loss of\nDr. YOUNG; and the present danger of many other the best and most\nimproved amongst us. May what is here to be proposed assist in their\npreservation!\n\nThe Geometrician or the learned Philosopher of whatever denomination,\nwhose course of study fixes his eye for ever on one object, his mind\nintensely and continually employed upon one thought, should be warned\nalso that he is in danger; or if he find himself already afflicted, he\nshould be told that the same course of life, which brought it on, will,\nwithout due care, encrease it to the most dreaded violence.\n\nThe middle period of life is that in which there is the greatest danger\nof an attack from this disease; and the latter end of autumn, when the\nsummer heats have a little time been over, is the season when in our\nclimate its first assaults are most to be expected. The same time of the\nyear always increases the disorder in those who have been before\nafflicted with it; and it is a truth must be confessed, that from its\nfirst attack the patient grows continually, though slowly, worse; unless\na careful regimen prevent it.\n\nThe constitutions most liable to this obstruction are the lean, and dark\ncomplexioned; the grave and sedentary. Let such watch the first\nsymptoms; and obviate, (as they may with ease) that which it will be\nmuch more difficult to remove.\n\nIt is happy a disease, wherein the patient must do a great deal for\nhimself, falls, for the most part, upon those who have the powers of\nreason strongest. Let them only be aware of this, that the distemper\nnaturally disposes them to inactivity; and reason will have no use\nunless accompanied with resolution to enforce it.\n\nThough the physician can do something toward the cure, much more depends\nupon the patient; and here his constancy of mind will be employed most\nhappily. No one is better qualified to judge on a fair hearing what\ncourse is the most fit; and having made that choice, he must with\npatience wait its good effects. Diseases that come on slowly must have\ntime for curing; an attention to the first appearances of the disorder\nwill be always happiest; because when least established it is easiest\noverthrown: but when that happy period has been neglected, he must wait\nthe effects of such a course as will dilute and melt the obstructing\nmatter gradually; for till that be done it is not only vain, but\nsometimes dangerous, to attempt its expulsion from the body.\n\nThe blood easily separates itself into the grosser and the thinner\nparts: we see this in bleeding; and from the toughness of the red cake\nmay guess how very difficult it will be to dissolve a substance of like\nfirmness in the vessels of the body. That it can thus become thickened\nwithin the body, a Pleurisy shews us too evidently: in that case it is\nbrought on suddenly, and with inflammation; in this other, slowly and\nwithout; and here, even before it forms the obstruction, can bring on\nmany mischiefs. Various causes can produce the same effect, but that in\nall cases operates most durably, which operates most slowly. The watery\npart of the blood is its mild part; in the remaining gross matter of it,\nare acrid salts and burning oils, and these, when destitute of that\nhappy dilution nature gives them in a healthy body, are capable of doing\ngreat mischief to the tender vessels in which they are kept stagnant.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. III. - The SYMPTOMS of the DISORDER.\n\n\nThe first and lightest of the signs that shew this illness are a lowness\nof spirits, and inaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love\nof solitude and a habit of thinking, even on trifling subjects, with too\nmuch steadiness. A very little help may combat these: but if that\nindolence which is indeed a part of the disorder, will neglect them;\nworse must be expected soon to follow.\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness, weight, and oppression in the body,\na want of appetite, or, what is worse, an appetite without digestion;\nfor these are the conditions of different states of the disease, a\nfullness and a difficulty of breathing after meals, a straitness of the\nbreast, pains and flatulencies in the bowels, and an unaptness to\ndischarge their contents.\n\nThe pulse becomes low, weak, and unequal; and there are frequent\npalpitations of the heart, a little dark-coloured urine is voided at\nsome times; and a flood of colourless and insipid at others; relieving\nfor a moment, but increasing the distemper: there is in some cases also\na continual teazing cough, with a choaking stoppage in the throat at\ntimes; then heartburn, sickness, hardness of the belly, and a costive\nhabit, or a tormenting and vain irritation.\n\nThe lips turn pale, the eyes loose their brightness and by degrees the\nwhite grows as it were greenish, the gums want their due firmness, with\ntheir proper colour; and an unpleasing foulness grows upon the teeth:\nthe inside of the mouth is pale and furred, and the throat dry and\nhusky: the colour of the skin is pale (though there are periods when the\nface is florid) and as the obstruction gathers ground, and more affects\nthe liver, the whole body becomes yellow, tawny, greenish, and at length\nof that deep and dusky hue, to which men of swift imagination have given\nthe name of blackness.\n\nThese symptoms do not all appear in any one period of the disease, or in\none case, but at one time or other all of them, as well as those which\nfollow: the flesh becomes cold to the touch, though the patient does not\nhimself perceive it; the limbs grow numbed and torpid, the breathing\ndull and slow, and the voice hollow; and usually the appetite in this\nperiod declines, and comes almost to nothing: night sweats come on,\nblack swellings appear on the veins, the flesh wastes and the breast\nbecomes flat and hollow: the mouth is full of a thin spittle, the head\nis dizzy and confus'd, and sometimes there is an unconquerable numbness\nin the organs of speech.\n\nI have known the temporary silence that follows upon this last symptom\nbecome a jest to the common herd; and the unhappy patient, instead of\ncompassion and assistance, receive the reproof of sullenness, from those\nwho should have known and acted better.\n\nAbout twenty years ago I met on a visit at Catthorpe in Leicestershire a\nyoung gentleman of distinguished learning and abilities, who at certain\ntimes was speechless. The vulgar thought it a pretence: and a jocose\nlady, where he was at tea with company, putting him as she said to a\ntrial, poured out a dish very strong and without sugar. He drank it and\nreturned the cup with a bow of great reserve, and his eye bent on the\nground: she then filled the cup with sugar, and pouring weak tea on it,\nsent it him: he drank that too, looked at her steadily, and blushed for\nher. The lady declared the man was dumb; the rest thought him perverse,\nand obstinate; but a constant and steady perseverance in an easy method\ncured him.\n\nAll these are miseries which the disease, while it retains its natural\nform, can bring upon the patient; and thus he will in time be worn out,\nand led miserably, though slowly, to the grave. Let him not indulge his\ninactivity so far as to give way to this, because it is represented as\nfar off; the disease may suddenly and frightfully change its nature; and\nswifter evils follow.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. IV. - The DANGER.\n\n\nWe have done with the obstruction considered in itself; but this, though\noften unsurmountable by art, at least by the methods now in use, will be\nsometimes broken through at once by nature, or by accidents; and bring\non fatal evils. These are strictly different diseases, and are no\notherway concerned here, than as the consequences of that of which we\nare treating.\n\nThe thick and glutinous blood which has so long stagnated in the spleen,\nwill have in that time altered its nature, and acquired a very great\ndegree of acrimony: while it lies dormant, this does no more mischiefs,\nthan those named already; but when violent exercise, a fit of outrageous\nanger, or any thing else that suddenly shocks and disturbs the frame,\nputs it in motion, it melts at once into a kind of liquid putrefaction.\n\nBeing now thin, it mixes itself readily with the blood again, and brings\non putrid fevers; destroys the substance of the spleen itself, or being\nthrown upon some other of the viscera, corrodes them, and leads on this\nway a swift and miserable death. If it fall upon the liver, its tender\npulpy substance is soon destroyed, jaundices beyond the help of art\nfirst follow, then dropsies and all their train of misery; if on lungs,\nconsumptions; if on the brain, convulsions, epilepsy, palsy, apoplexy;\nif on the surface, leprosy.\n\nThe intention of cure is to melt this coagulation softly, not to break\nit violently; and then to give it a very gentle passage through the\nbowels. There is no safe way for it to take but that; and even that when\nurged too far may bring on fatal dysenteries.\n\nLet none wonder at the sudden devastation which sometimes arises from\nthis long stagnant matter, when liquified too hastily: how long, how\nmany years the impacted matter will continue quiet in a schirrous tumour\nof the breast; but being once put in motion, whether from accident, or\nin the course of nature, what can describe; or what can stop its\nhavock!\n\nInstances of the other are too frequent. A nobleman the other day died\nparalytick: dissection shewed a spleen consumed by an abscess, formed\nfrom the dissolved matter of such an obstruction: and 'tis scarce longer\nsince, a learned gentleman, who had been several years lost to his\nfriends, by the extreams of a Hypochondriacal disorder, seem'd gradually\nwithout assistance to recover: but the lungs suffered while the spleen\nwas freed; and he died very soon of what is called a galloping\nconsumption.\n\nWhen the obstruction is great and of long continuance, if it be thus\nhastily moved, the consequence is, equally, a sudden and a miserable\ndeath, whether, like the matter of a cancer, it remains in its place; or\nlike that of a bad small pox, be thrown upon some other vital part.\n\nLet not the patient be too much alarmed; this is laid down to caution,\nnot to terrify him: it is fit he should know his danger, and attend to\nit; for the prevention is easy; and the cure, even of the most advanced\nstages, when undertaken by gentle means, is not at all impracticable: to\nassist the physician, let him look into himself, and recollect the\nsource of his complaint. This he may judge of from the following\nnotices.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. V. - The Causes of the HYPOCHONDRIASIS.\n\n\nThe obstruction which forms this disease, may take its origin from\ndifferent accidents: a fever ill cured has often caused it; or the\npiles, which had been used to discharge largely, ceasing; a marshy soil,\npoisoned with stagnant water, has given it to some persons; and altho'\nindolence and inactivity are oftenest at the root, yet it has arisen\nfrom too great exercise.\n\nReal grief has often brought it on; and even love, for sometimes that is\nreal. Study and fixed attention of the mind have been accused before;\nand add to these the stooping posture of the body, which most men use,\nthough none should use it, in writing and in reading. This has\ncontributed too much to it; but of all other things night studies are\nthe most destructive. The steady stillness, and dusky habit of all\nnature in those hours, enforce, encourage, and support that settled\ngloom, which rises from fixt thought; and sinks the body to the grave;\neven while it carries up the mind to heaven. He who would have his lamp\n        At midnight hour\n  Be seen in some high lonely tower,\nwill waste the flame of this unheeded life: and while he labours to\nunsphere the spirit of Plato will let loose his own.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VI. - The Cure of the HYPOCHONDRIASIS.\n\n\nLet him who would escape the mischiefs of an obstructed spleen, avoid\nthe things here named: and let him who suffers from the malady,\nendeavour to remember to which of them it has been owing; for half the\nhope depends upon that knowledge.\n\nNature has sometimes made a cure herself, and we should watch her ways;\nfor art never is so right as when it imitates her: sometimes the\npatient's own resolution has set him free. This is always in his power,\nand at all times will do wonders.\n\nThe bleeding of the piles, from nature's single efforts, has at once\ncured a miserable man; where their cessation was the cause of the\ndisorder. A leprosy has appeared upon the skin, and all the symptoms of\nthe former sickness vanished. This among the Jews happened often: both\ndiseases we know were common among them: and I have here seen something\nvery like it: Water-Dock has thrown out scorbutic eruptions, and all the\nformer symptoms of an Hypochondriacal disorder have disappeared:\nreturning indeed when these were unadvisedly struck in; but keeping off\nentirely when they were better treated. A natural purging unsuppressed\nhas sometimes done the same good office: but this is hazardous.\n\nIt is easy to be directed from such instances; only let us take the\nwhole along with us. Bleeding would have answered nature's purpose, if\nshe could not have opened of herself the h\u00e6morrhoidal vessels; but he\nwho should give medicines for that purpose, might destroy his patient by\ntoo great disturbance. If a natural looseness may perform the cure, so\nmay an artificial; when the original source of the disorder points that\nway. But these are helps that take place only in particular cases.\n\nThe general and universal method of cure must be by some mild and gently\nresolving medicine, under the influence of which the obstructing matter\nmay be voided that, or some other way with safety. The best season to\nundertake this is the autumn, but even here there must be caution.\n\nIn the first place, no strong evacuating remedy must be given; for that,\nby carrying off the thinner parts of the juices, will tend to thicken\nthe remainder; and certainly encrease the distemper. No acrid medicine\nmust be directed, for that may act too hastily, dissolve the impacted\nmatter at once, and let it loose, to the destruction of the sufferer; no\nantimonial, no mercurial, no martial preparation must be taken; in\nshort, no chymistry: nature is the shop that heaven has set before us,\nand we must seek our medicine there. The venerable ancients, who knew\nnot this new art, will lead us in the search; and (faithful relators as\nthey are of truth) will tell us whence we may deduce our hope; and what\nwe are to fear.\n\nBut prior to the course of any medicine, and as an essential to any good\nhope from it, the patient must prescribe himself a proper course of\nlife, and a well chosen diet: let us assist him in his choice; and speak\nof this first, as it comes first in order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VI. - Rules of Life for Hypochondriac Persons.\n\n\nAir and exercise, as they are the best preservers of health, and\ngreatest assistants in the cure of all long continued diseases, will\nhave their full effect in this; but there requires some caution in the\nchoice, and management of them. It is common to think the air of high\ngrounds best; but experience near home shews otherwise: the\nHypochondriac patient is always worse at Highgate even than in London.\n\nThe air he breathes should be temperate; not exposed to the utmost\nviolences of heat and cold, and the swift changes from one to the\nother; which are most felt on those high grounds. The side of a hill is\nthe best place for him: and though wet grounds are hurtful; yet let\nthere be the shade of trees, to tempt him often to a walk; and soften by\ntheir exhalation the over dryness of the air.\n\nThe exercise he takes should be frequent; but not violent. Motion\npreserves the firmness of the parts, and elasticity of the vessels; it\nprevents that aggregation of thick humours which he is most to fear. A\nsedentary life always produces weakness, and that mischief always\nfollows: weak eyes are gummy, weak lungs are clogged with phlegm, and\nweak bowels waste themselves in vapid diarrhoeas.\n\nLet him invite himself abroad, and let his friends invite him by every\ninnocent inducement. For me, I should advise above all other things the\nstudy of nature. Let him begin with plants: he will here find a\ncontinual pleasure, and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful\nthings; even of the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to\nwalk; and every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket,\nwill afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually\nin the air, and continually to change the nature and quality of the air,\nby visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the lawn, the\nheath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be abroad; and the\nunceasing variety of the subjects of his observation, will prevent his\nwalking hastily: he will pursue his studies in the air; and that\ncontemplative turn of mind, which in his closet threatened his\ndestruction, will thus become the great means of his recovery.\n\nIf the mind tire upon this, from the repeated use, another of nature's\nkingdoms opens itself at once upon him; the plant he is weary of\nobserving, feeds some insect he may examine; nor is there a stone that\nlies before his foot, but may afford instruction and amusement.\n\nEven what the vulgar call the most abject things will shew a wonderful\nutility; and lead the mind, in pious contemplation higher than the\nstars. The poorest moss that is trampled under foot, has its important\nuses: is it at the bottom of a wood we find it? why there it shelters\nthe fallen seeds; hides them from birds, and covers them from frost;\nand thus becomes the foster father of another forest! creeps it along\nthe surface of a rock? even there its good is infinite! its small roots\nrun into the stone, and the rains make their way after them; the moss\nhaving lived its time dies; it rots and with the mouldered fragments of\nthe stone forms earth; wherein, after a few successions, useful plants\nmay grow, and feed more useful cattle!\n\nIs there a weed more humble in its aspect, more trampled on, or more\ndespised than knot grass! no art can get the better of its growth, no\nlabour can destroy it; 'twere pity if they could, for the thing lives\nwhere nothing would of use to us; and its large and most wonderfully\nabundant seeds, feed in hard winters, half the birds of Heaven.\n\nWhat the weak moss performs upon the rock the loathed toadstool brings\nabout in timber: is an oak dead where man's eye will not find it? this\nfungus roots itself upon the bark, and rots the wood beneath it; hither\nthe beetle creeps for shelter, and for sustenance; him the woodpecker\nfollows as his prey; and while he tears the tree in search of him, he\nscatters it about the ground; which it manures.\n\nNor is it the beetle alone that thus insinuates itself into the\nsubstance of the vegetable tribe: the tender aphide, whom a touch\ndestroys, burrows between the two skins of a leaf, for shelter from his\nwinged enemies; tracing, with more than Dedal\u00e6an art, his various\nmeanders; and veining the green surface with these white lines more\nbeautifully than the best \u00c6gyptian marble.\n\n'Twere endless to proceed; nor is it needful: one object will not fail\nto lead on to another, and every where the goodness of his God will\nshine before him even in what are thought the vilest things; his\ngreatness in the lead of them.\n\nLet him pursue these thoughts, and seek abroad the objects and the\ninstigations to them: but let him in these and all other excursions\navoid equally the dews of early morning, and of evening.\n\nThe more than usual exercise of this prescription will dispose him to\nmore than customary sleep, let him indulge it freely; so far from\nhurting, it will help his cure.\n\nLet him avoid all excesses: drink need scarce be named, for we are\nwriting to men of better and of nobler minds, than can be tempted to\nthat humiliating vice. Those who in this disorder have too great an\nappetite, must not indulge it; much eaten was never well digested: but\nof all excesses the most fatal in this case is that of venery. It is the\nexcess we speak of.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VII. - The proper DIET.\n\n\nIn the first place acids must be avoided carefully; and all things that\nare in a state of fermentation, for they will breed acidity. Provisions\nhardened by salting never should be tasted; much less those cured by\nsmoaking, and by salting. Bacon is indigestible in an Hypochondriac\nstomach; and hams, impregnated as is now the custom, with acid fumes\nfrom the wood fires over which they are hung, have that additional\nmischief.\n\nMilk ought to be a great article in the diet: and even in this there\nshould be choice. The milk of grass-fed cows has its true quality: no\nother. There are a multitude of ways in which this may be made a part\nboth of our foods and drinks, and they should all be used.\n\nThe great and general caution is that the diet be at all times of a kind\nloosening and gently stimulating; light but not acrid. Veal, lamb,\nfowls, lobsters, crabs, craw-fish, fresh water fish and mutton broth,\nwith plenty of boiled vegetables, are always right; and give enough\nvariety.\n\nRaw vegetables are all bad: sour wines, old cheese, and bottled beer are\nthings never to be once tasted. Indeed much wine is wrong, be it of what\nkind soever. It is the first of cordials; and as such I would have it\ntaken in this disease when it is wanted: plainly as a medicine, rather\nthan a part of diet. Malt liquor carefully chosen is certainly the best\ndrink. This must be neither new, nor tending to sourness; perfectly\nclear, and of a moderate strength: it is the native liquor of our\ncountry, and the most healthful.\n\nToo much tea weakens; and even sugar is in this disorder hurtful: but\nhoney may supply its place in most things; and this is not only harmless\nbut medicinal; a very powerful dissolvent of impacted humours, and a\ngreat deobstruent.\n\nWhat wine is drank should be of some of the sweet kinds. Old Hock has\nbeen found on enquiry to yield more than ten times the acid of the sweet\nwines; and in red Port, at least in what we are content to call so,\nthere is an astringent quality, that is most mischievous in these cases:\nit is said there is often alum in it: how pregnant with mischief that\nmust be to persons whose bowels require to be kept open, is most\nevident. Summer fruits perfectly ripe are not only harmless but\nmedicinal; but if eaten unripe they will be very prejudicial. A light\nsupper, which will leave an appetite for a milk breakfast, is always\nright; this will not let the stomach be ravenous for dinner, as it is\napt to be in those who make that their only meal.\n\nOne caution more must be given, and it may seem a strange one: it is\nthat the patient attend regularly to his hours of eating. We have to do\nwith men for the most part whose soul is the great object of their\nregard; but let them not forget they have a body.\n\nThe late Dr. STUKELY has told me, that one day by appointment visiting\nSir ISAAC NEWTON, the servant told him, he was in his study. No one was\npermitted to disturb him there; but as it was near dinner time, the\nvisitor sat down to wait for him. After a time dinner was brought in; a\nboil'd chicken under a cover. An hour pass'd, and Sir ISAAC did not\nappear. The doctor eat the fowl, and covering up the empty dish, bad\nthem dress their master another. Before that was ready, the great man\ncame down; he apologiz'd for his delay, and added, \"give me but leave to\ntake my short dinner, and I shall be at your service; I am fatigued and\nfaint.\" Saying this, he lifted up the cover; and without any emotion,\nturned about to STUKELY with a smile; \"See says he, what we studious\npeople are, I forgot I had din'd.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VIII. - The MEDICINE.\n\n\n'Tis the ill fate of this disease, more than of all others to be\nmisunderstood at first, and thence neglected; till the physician shakes\nhis head at a few first questions. None steals so fatally upon the\nsufferer: its advances are by very slow degrees; but every day it grows\nmore difficult of cure.\n\nThat this obstruction in the spleen is the true malady, the cases\nrelated by the antients, present observation, and the unerring\ntestimonies of dissections leave no room to doubt. Being understood, the\npath is open where to seek a remedy: and our best guides in this, as in\nthe former instance, will be those venerable Greeks; who saw a thousand\nof these cases, where we see one; and with less than half our theory,\ncured twice as many patients.\n\nOne established doctrine holds place in all these writers; that whatever\nby a hasty fermentation dissolves the impacted matter of the\nobstruction, and sends it in that state into the blood, does incredible\nmischief: but that whatever medicine softens it by slow degrees, and, as\nit melts, delivers it to the bowels without disturbance; will cure with\nequal certainty and safety.\n\nFor this good purpose, they knew and tried a multitude of herbs; but in\nthe end they fixed on one: and on their repeated trials of this, they\nbanished all the rest. This stood alone for the cure of the disease; and\nfrom its virtue received the name of SPLEEN-WORT. O wise and happy\nGreeks! authors of knowledge and perpetuators of it! With them the very\nname they gave a plant declared its virtues: with us, a writer calls a\nplant from some friend; that the good gardener who receives the honour,\nmay call another by his name who gave it. We now add the term smooth\nto this herb, to distinguish it from another, called by the same general\nterm, though not much resembling it.\n\nThe virtues of this smooth Spleen-wort have flood the test of ages; and\nthe plant every where retained its name and credit: and one of our good\nherbalists, who had seen a wonderful case of a swoln spleen, so big, and\nhard as to be felt with terror, brought back to a state of nature by it;\nand all the miserable symptoms vanish; thought Spleen-wort not enough\nexpressive of its excellence; but stamp'd on it the name of MILT-WASTE.\n\nIn the Greek Islands now, the use of it is known to every one; and even\nthe lazy monks who take it, are no longer splenetic. In the west of\nEngland, the rocks are stripped of it with diligence; and every old woman\ntells you how charming that leaf is for bookish men: in Russia they use\na plant of this kind in their malt liquor: it came into fashion there\nfor the cure of this disease; which from its constant use is scarce\nknown any longer; and they suppose 'tis added to their liquor for a\nflavour.\n\nThe ancients held it in a kind of veneration; and used what has been\ncalled a superstition in the gathering it. It was to be taken up with a\nsharp knife, without violence, and laid upon the clean linen: no time\nbut the still darkness of the night was proper, and even the moon was\nnot to shine upon it. I know they have been ridiculed for this; for\nnothing is so vain as learned ignorance: but let me be permitted once to\nvindicate them.\n\nThe plant has leaves that can close in their sides; and their under part\nis covered thick with a yellow powder, consisting of the seeds, and seed\nvessels: in these they knew the virtue most resided: this was the golden\ndust they held so valuable; and this they knew they could not be too\ncautious to preserve. They were not ignorant of the sleep of plants; a\nmatter lately spoken of by some, as if a new discovery; and being\nsensible that light, a dry air, an expanded leaf, and a tempestuous\nseason, were the means of losing this fine dust; and knowing also that\ndarkness alone brought on that closing of the leaf which thence has\nbeen called sleep; and which helped to defend and to secure it, they\ntherefore took such time, and used such means as could best preserve the\nplant entire; and even save what might be scattered from it.--And now\nwhere is their superstition?\n\nFrom this plant thus collected they prepared a medicine, which in a\ncourse of forty days scarce ever failed to make a perfect cure.\n\nWe have the plant wild with us; and till the fashion of rough chemical\npreparations took off our attention from these gentler remedies, it was\nin frequent use and great repute. I trust it will be so again: and many\nthank me for restoring it to notice.\n\nSpleen-wort gives out its virtues freely in a tincture; and a small dose\nof this, mixing readily with the blood and juices, gradually dissolves\nthe obstruction; and by a little at a time delivers its contents to be\nthrown off without pain, from the bowels. Let this be done while the\nviscera are yet sound and the cure is perfect. More than the forty days\nof the Greek method is scarce ever required; much oftener two thirds of\nthat time suffice; and every day, from the first dose of it, the patient\nfeels the happy change that is growing in his constitution. His food no\nmore turns putrid on his stomach, but yields its healthful nourishment.\n\nThe swelling after meals therefore vanishes; and with that goes the\nlowness, and anxiety, the difficult breath, and the distracting cholick:\nhe can bear the approach of rainy weather without pain; he finds himself\nmore apt for motion, and ready to take that exercise which is to be\nassistant in his cure; life seems no longer burthensome. His bowels get\ninto the natural condition of health, and perform their office once at\nleast a day; better if a little more: the dull and dead colour of his\nskin goes off, his lips grow red again, and every sign of health\nreturns.\n\nLet him who takes the medicine, say whether any thing here be\nexaggerated. Let him, if he pleases to give himself the trouble, talk\nover with me, or write to me, this gradual decrease of his complaints,\nas he proceeds in his cure. My uncertain state of health does not\npermit me to practise physic in the usual way, but I am very desirous to\ndo what good I can, and shall never refuse my advice, such as it may be,\nto any person rich or poor, in whatever manner he may apply for it. I\nshall refer him to no apothecary, whose bills require he should be\ndrenched with potions; but tell him, in this as in all other cases,\nwhere to find some simple herb; which he may if he please prepare\nhimself; or if he had rather spare that trouble, may have it so prepared\nfrom me.\n\nWith regard to Spleen-wort, no method of using it is more effectual than\nsimply taking it in powder; the only advantage of a tincture, is that a\nproper dose may be given, and yet the stomach not be loaded with so\nlarge a quantity: it is an easier and pleasanter method, and nothing\nmore.\n\nIf any person choose to take it in the other way, I should still wish\nhim once at least to apply to me; that he may be assured what he is\nabout to take is the right plant. Abuses in medicines are at this time\nvery great, and in no instance worse than what relates to herbs. The\nbest of our physicians have complained upon this head with warmth, but\nwithout redress: they know the virtues and the value of many of our\nnative plants, but dread to prescribe them; lest some wrong thing should\nbe administered in their place; perhaps inefficacious, perhaps\nmischievous, nay it may be fatal. The few simple things I direct are\nalways before me; and it will at all times be a pleasure to me, in this\nand any other instance, to see whether what any person is about to take\nbe right. I have great obligations to the public, and this is the best\nreturn that I know how to make.\n\nTo see the need of such a caution, hear a transaction but of yesterday!\n\nAn intelligent person was directed to go to the medicinal herb shops in\nthe several markets, and buy some of this Spleen-wort; the name was\nwritten, and shewn to every one; every shop received his money, and\nalmost every one sold a different plant, under the name of this: but\nwhat is very striking, not one of them the right. Such is the chance of\nhealth in those hands through which the best means of it usually pass;\neven in the most regular course of application.\n\nI would not be understood to limit the little services I may this way be\nable to render the afflicted, to this single instance; much less to\npropose to myself any advantages from it. Whoever pleases will be\nwelcome to me, upon any such occasion; and whatever be the herb on which\nhe places a dependance, he shall be shewn it growing. I once recommended\na garden to be established for this use, at the public expence: one\ngreat person has put it in my power to answer all its purposes.\n\n                        F  I  N  I  S.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris, he was\n\"nominated\" to the Academy. He had but to present an Historical\nPainting in order to take his seat as an Academician.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VENUS AND MARRIAGE\n\n\nBack in his beloved Paris again; thrilled by the atmosphere and gaiety\nof its merry life; in the full vigour of manhood on the eve of his\nthirties; amongst congenial friends; done with the drudgery of winning\nto Academic honour, Boucher saw that the public were not falling over\neach other to purchase religious or historic pictures; he straightway\nturned his back upon these things, and on the edge of his thirtieth\nyear he gave to the world his \"Marriage of the Children of God with\nthe Children of Men,\" in which Venus is the avowed mistress of his\nadoration. It caused a fine stir, and greatly increased his repute.\n\nIn this picture he ends his Italian period and strikes his own\npersonal note. Both this and the \"Venus asking arms for Aeneas from\nVulcan,\" together with the \"Birth of Adonis\" and the \"Death of\nAdonis,\" of about the same period, still show Boucher strongly under\nthe influence of his master, Lemoyne. Indeed, the \"Birth\" and \"Death\nof Adonis,\" their record lost during the scuffle and confusion of the\nRevolution, for long hung side by side as pictures by Lemoyne, until,\nbeing cleaned about 1860, Boucher's initials were discovered upon\nthem, and, contemporary engravings being hunted up, still further\nproved their origin. But in the Venus that now figures in all his\nworks there is that flesh-painting of the nude, and that rosy touch\nupon the flesh of the female figure, that are a far more certain\nsignature of Boucher's handiwork than any written name.\n\nUnfortunately the Salons were closed during Boucher's earlier years\nuntil he was thirty-four, and the record of his work during these\nyears is difficult to follow; but with his service to Venus his\npersonal career begins, and the stream of his Venus-pieces steadily\nflows from his hands.\n\nHe came to her service rid of all prentice essays in craftsmanship, a\nfinished and consummate artist. He found in his subject a goddess to\nwhom he could devote his great and splendid gifts. He painted her\ndainty body with a radiant delight and a rare colour-sense such as\nFrance had never before seen or uttered. He remains to this day the\nfirst painter of the subtle, delicate, and elusive thing that is\nfemininity; he caught her allure, her charm, as he was to catch the\nfragrance and charm of children and flowers; and he set the statement\nof these things upon canvas as they have never been uttered.\n\nThe whole of his life long, Boucher gave himself up with equal and\npassionate devotion to work and to pleasure--working at his easel\noften twelve hours of his day without losing, to the end when the\nbrush fell from his dead fingers, his blitheness of heart or his\ngenerosity of act, and without weakening the pleasure-loving desires\nof his gadding spirit. Out of his splendid toil he made the means to\nindulge his tastes for pleasure; and the gratifying of his tastes in\nturn renewed and created the ideas that made the subjects of his\nartistry. He brought to all he did a joy in the doing that made of his\nvast labour one long pleasure--of his pleasures a riot of industry. He\nplayed as he toiled, scarce knowing which was play and which toil.\n\nThe gossip of his love-affairs makes no romantic story--they were but\ncommonplace ecstasies with unknown frail women. But hard as he worked\nand lived and played, he found time to get himself married in his\nthirtieth year to pretty seventeen-year-old Marie Jeanne Buseau, a\nlittle Parisian--and for love of her, so far as he understood the\nbusiness; for she brought him no dowry.\n\nThe young couple settled down for the next ten years in the Rue\nSaint-Thomas-du-Louvre. Here Boucher lived through his thirties.\n\nMadame was a pretty creature, if we had but Latour's pastel portrait\nalone to prove it. But the pretty features were the crown to as pretty\na body, for she sat often to her lord; and it is clear from his\ncorrespondence with a friend, Bachaumont, that she is the Psyche of\nhis illustrated fable--and Psyche runs much to the Altogether.\n\nMarriage, however, was not likely to imprison Boucher's gadding eyes;\nand it did not. Madame Boucher seems to have had as frail a heart, and\navoided strife by amusing herself, amongst others, with the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who, to gain access to the lady,\ncommissioned Boucher to do the Watteau-like illustrations to\nAcajou--a dull affair. Boucher's pretty wife, herself no mean\nartist, worked in his studio, and painted several smaller canvases\nafter his pictures, gaining some fame as a miniaturist and engraver.\n\nNor did Marriage turn Boucher from his art. Two years were gone by\nsince his nomination to the Academy; he had now to paint the formal\nHistorical Picture and present it in order to take his seat as\nAcademician; and it was in this his thirtieth year that he painted and\nwon his academic rank with the \"Renauld et Armide\" now at the Louvre.\n\nHere he sufficiently subordinated his own style to the academic to\nensure success; and the work was hailed by Academicians and critics,\nincluding Diderot, with enthusiasm. But even here we have his cupids\npeeping round the mythologic event; and Armide herself has pretty\nFrench lips that knew no Greek.\n\nOnce secure of his position, he straightway flung the last remnants of\nthe academic style out of his studio door; and it is a grim comment on\ncriticism that it was just exactly in proportion as he developed his\nown personal genius and uttered the France of his day, that he was\nattacked; whilst the stilted things that he knew were third-rate, and\nwhich he wholly rejected from henceforth, were exactly the things that\nwere praised!\n\nHis election to the Academy, and the enthusiasm over the picture that\nwon him his seat thereat, brought his name before the young king; the\nfollowing year he received his first order from the Court whose\npainter he was destined to become. The decorations in the queen's\napartments were gloomy and had grown black; and he painted in their\nstead the \"Charity,\" \"Abundance,\" \"Fidelity,\" and \"Prudence\" still\nthere to be seen. Indeed, with his gay vision, his pretty habit of\nculling only the flowers from the garden of life, and his quickness to\nset down the pleasing thing in every prospect, Boucher was the\ndestined painter of a Court weary of pomposity and the pose of the\nmock-heroic, and which was wholly giving itself up to pleasure and the\nelegances.\n\nBut neither his new dignity of Academician nor the royal favour, kept\nhim from the bookshops; and he illustrated, with rare beauty and a\ncharm worthy of Watteau, the great edition of the Works of Moli\u00e8re\nin his thirty-first year. It is true that he made as free with\nMoli\u00e8re's world as with the Gods of Olympus; he peoples the plays with\ncharacters of his own day, arrayed in the dress and habit of that day,\nand moving in surroundings that he saw about him.\n\n\nLE MONDE QUI S'AMUSE\n\n\nThe Homely had come upon the town out of Holland, painted with most\nconsummate artistry by Chardin, and was soon in the vogue. Boucher had\na quick eye for the mode. And he straightway set himself to the\npainting of \"La Belle Cuisini\u00e8re.\" Still-life and homely subjects need\nan accuracy of realism and a Dutch sense of these things, a sense of\nsincerity and an appreciation of the dignity of the work-a-day life of\nthe people, in which Boucher was wholly lacking. Above all, it calls\nfor a sense of \"character,\" which, in Boucher, was always weak. It was\na sneer against him that his very broomsticks called for pompons and\nribbons--and there was more than a little truth in the spite. He is\nmore concerned with the accident of the kissing of a kitchen-maid than\nwith the kitchen's habit. He cannot even peep into a scullery without\ndragging in Venus by the skirts, and tricking her out in a\nproperty-wardrobe of a scullery-wench, in which the girl is clearly\nbut acting the part.\n\nHowever, these passing vogues and experiments in different methods\nwere only gay asides--he was working the while upon his own subjects;\nand, to the display by its several members ordered by the Academy, he\nsent four little paintings of fauns and cupids which won him the\nhonour of election as deputy-professor. His brain and hand were very\nbusy, and he turns from one thing to another with amazing facility,\nbringing distinction to all that he does.\n\nBut he painted about this time two pictures of infants, \"L'Amour\nOiseleur\" and \"L'Amour Moissonneur,\" which were the beginning of that\nhost of cupids that he let fly from his studio; they frolic across his\ncanvases and join the retinue of Venus, peeping out from clouds, over\nwaves, round curtains, painted with a perfection that has never been\nsurpassed in the portrayal of infants. He painted their round limbs,\ntheir lusty life, their delightful awkwardnesses, their jolly fat\ngrace, their na\u00efve surprise at life and glory in it, as they had never\nbeen painted before, and have never been painted since.\n\nHe also gave forth in this his thirty-third year a \"Pastoral\" and a\n\"Shepherd and Shepherdess in Conversation,\" with sheep about them and\nin a pleasant landscape, which were his first essays in the style that\nhe created and which made him famous.\n\nHis friend Meissonnier, the inventor of the rococo, stood godfather to\nBoucher's first-born son in the May of 1736.\n\nFrom the very beginning Boucher seems to have been engraved. And these\nengravings, done by the best gravers of his day, greatly extended his\nreputation and popularised him; he fully realised the value of the\nadvertisement as well as his profits from it. Before his thirty-third\nyear was run out he published his well-known \"Cries of Paris.\"\n\nBoucher's description of them, \"studies from the low classes,\" holds\nthe key to that something of failure to realise the dramatic verities\nthat is over all; it gives also the attitude of the France that he\nknew towards the France that he did not, and could not understand. He\ncreated that dainty, pleasant atmosphere that comes floating up to the\nwindows on a fresh morning in Paris from the musical cries of\nthe street vendors; but of the deeper significance of the\nstreet-sellers--of the miserable accent in their life, of their weary\ntoil, of the dignity of their labour--he knew nothing; his brush could\nnot refrain from making elegance and fine manners peep from behind the\nstreet-porter's fustian or the milkmaid's skirt.\n\nBut his thirty-third year was to contain a more far-reaching\nsignificance even than the creation of his cupid-pieces and pastorals.\n\nThe \"Cries of Paris\" were scarce printed when Boucher's illustration\nto \"Don Quixote\" appeared--\"Sancho pursued by the servants of the\nDuke.\" This design was to have far-reaching results that Boucher\nlittle suspected.\n\nThe painter Oudry had been called to the conduct of the great tapestry\nlooms at Beauvais a couple of years before; and in his efforts to\nfurnish the looms with good designs, he now called Boucher to his aid,\nwhose original and fresh style, colour, and arrangement, together with\nhis personal vision, and the enthusiasm and zeal with which he threw\nhimself into the work, at once increased the reputation and the\nproducts of the famous looms. This large designing for the tapestries\nwas, in return, of immense value to the development of the genius of\nthe man, enlarging his breadth of style and giving scope to that great\ndecorative sense that was his superb gift. Thenceforth he was destined\nto play a supreme part in the history of the world-famed factories. He\nnow produced painting after painting for the Beauvais looms.\n\nLife is now one long triumph for Boucher, only disturbed in this year\nby the sad news of the suicide of his old master, Lemoyne. It was in\nthis, Boucher's thirty-fourth year, that the Salon was opened for the\nfirst time since Boucher's infancy, and he contributed several\ncanvases to it.\n\nRigaud, the old Academician, now close upon eighty, straggling through\nthe great galleries, might well blink and gasp at the change that had\ncome over French art since he last exhibited there, thirty-three years\ngone by; but his scoffs and regrets held no terrors for the younger\nAcademicians gathered about. He stood in a new world. A new generation\nwas in possession. The grand manner, the severe etiquette, formal\nmock-heroics, and solemn pomposity of Louis the Fourteenth were\nvanished, and the Agreeable and the Pleasant Make-Believe of Louis the\nFifteenth reigned in their stead. Old Rigaud might blink indeed! Just\nas the imposing and stilted etiquette of the reception-room had given\nplace to the easy manners and airy etiquette of the dainty boudoir, so\nhad light chatter and gay wit and the quick repartee usurped the heavy\nsplendours of a consequential age. France, weary of an eternal pose of\nthe grand manner, was seeking change in joyousness and amusement.\n\nGallantry and gaiety were become the object of the ambition of a\ndandified and elegant day. France became a coquette; dressed herself\nas a porcelain shepherdess; and with beribboned crook and sheep,\nseeking pleasant prospects to stroll through, gave herself to\ndalliance--her powder-puff and patch-box and fan a serious part of her\nunseriousness.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE CH\u00c2TEAUROUX\n\n\nAt thirty-five Boucher has arrived. He is in the vogue; in favour at\nCourt--as well as in the fashion. In his three years from taking his\nseat at the Academy to the opening of the first Salon he has created a\nnew and original style--his cupid pieces, his pastorals, his\nVenus-pieces, his tapestry. Boucher's kingdom lay in the realm of the\ndecorative painter--and he has found it. Torn from the surroundings\nfor which he designed them, as part and parcel of the general scheme,\nhis pictures are as out of place as an Italian altarpiece in an\nEnglish dining-room, yet they suffer less. Several may still be seen,\nas he set them up in frames of his own planning, as overdoors in the\npalace of the Soubise, now given up to the national archives.\n\nThe ghost of the Prince of Soubise, who commissioned them, may haunt\nhis palace, but his kin know the place no longer. The overdoors\nwrought by Boucher's skill look down now on the nation's collection of\nhistoric documents. The \"Three Graces enchaining Love,\" the fine\npastoral of \"The Cage,\" and the pastoral of the \"Shepherd placing a\nRose in his Shepherdess's Hair,\" were to see a mightier change than\nthe usurpation of Louis the Fourteenth's pompous age by the elegant\nyears of Louis the Fifteenth. But this was not as yet. Here at least\nwe see Boucher's art rid of all outside influences, and at the full\ntide of creation; here we have the inimitable lightness of touch, the\nfigures and landscape bathed in the airy volume of atmosphere.\n\nHe seems at this time to have played with pastel, due probably to his\nfriendship with Latour, who sent a portrait of Boucher's wife to this\nSalon. Boucher showed in the use of chalks the artistry and skill that\nwere always at his command.\n\nHe also was putting to its full use his innate sense of landscape,\nraising to high achievement that astonishing balance of landscape and\nfigures in his design--a balance that has never been surpassed; his\nfigures never override his landscape; his landscape never overpowers\nhis figures. His earnest counsels to his pupils and his constant\ndeploring of the lack of the landscape art in France prove the great\nstress he laid upon it.\n\nThe designing of a frontispiece for the catalogue of a personal\nfriend, one Gersaint, a merchant of oriental wares, started Boucher in\nhis thirty-third year upon that series of Chinese pictures and\ntapestries known as the \"Chinoiseries,\" in which he frittered away\nonly too many precious hours, for they were received with great favour\nby the public. The paintings of Chinese subjects designed for the\nlooms of Beauvais are still to be seen at Besan\u00e7on.\n\nBut busy as were his brain and hand in the exercise of his wide and\nversatile gifts, pouring out \"Chinoiseries,\" illustrations for books,\ntapestries on a large scale, landscapes, models for the gilt bronze\ndecorations of porcelain vases, scheming handsome frames for his\npictures, designing furniture and fans--Boucher was true, above all,\n\"to his goddess,\" and painted the famed \"Birth of Venus,\" which,\nthanks to the Swedish Ambassador's fondness for Madame Boucher, now\nhangs at Stockholm; our amorous Count de Tessin, to be just, seems to\nhave had a rare flair for the artistic--besides artist's wives. It was\non the 15th of April in 1742, the last year of his thirties, that the\nRoyal favour was marked by the grant of a pension of 400 livres\n(double florins) to Boucher with promise of early benefits to follow.\n\nTwo years afterwards it was raised to 600 livres.\n\nThis was the year that he painted the beautiful canvas of \"Diana\nleaving the Bath with one of her Companions,\" now at the Louvre. It\nwas also the year that saw his landscape, the \"Hamlet of Iss\u00e9\" at the\nSalon. This \"Hameau d'Iss\u00e9\" was to be enlarged for the Opera, proving\nhim to be decorator there, where he was arranging waterfalls,\ncascades, and the rest of the pretty business, without staying his\nhand from his art.\n\nAt forty Boucher has come into his kingdom. The ten years of these\nforties were to be a vast triumph for him. He was to produce\nmasterpiece after masterpiece. His art had caught the taste of the\nday. He was at the height of his powers. He had done great things--he\nwas to do greater. During these ten years of his forties he poured\nforth vivid and glowing works of sustained power and originality.\n\nWe have a picture of him as he was in the flesh at this time--the\npastel portrait by Lundberg, now at the Louvre--a gay, somewhat\ndissipated, handsomely dressed dandy of the time, smiling out of his\ncareless day, the debonnair man of fashion, the laughing eyes showing\nsigns of the night carousals, which were the rest from the prodigious\ntoil of this vital and forthright spirit.\n\nIt was in this our artist's fortieth year that the gifted old Cardinal\nFleury, who had guided the fortunes of France with rare skill, died,\nbroken by his ninety years and the blunders of the disastrous war that\nhe had so strenuously opposed; and Louis, essaying the strut of\nkingship, became king by act. His indolent character, unequal to the\nmighty business, his indeterminate will fretted by the set of\nquarrelling and intriguing rogues that he gathered about him as his\nministers, he fell into the habit that became his thenceforth, the\nonly thing to which he paid the tribute of constancy--he ruled France\nfrom behind pretty petticoats. He had early shown the adulterous blood\nof his great-grandfather; two, if not three, of five sisters of the\nnoble and historic house of De Nesle had yielded to his gadding fancy;\nthe youngest now ousted her sister De Mailly from the king's favour,\nwas publicly acknowledged as the king's mistress, and became Duchess\nof Ch\u00e2teauroux. Boucher painted her handsome being as a shepherdess in\none of his pastorals. She was no ordinary toy of a king. A woman of\ntalent, with hot ambitions for the king's majesty, fired with the\npride of race of the old French noblesse, it was during her short\nyears of ascendancy over the king that he roused from his body's\ntorpor and made an effort to reach the dignity and eminence befitting\nto the lord of a great and gallant people. He stepped forth awhile\nfrom his drunken bouts and manifold mean adulteries, and set himself\nat the head of the army in Flanders, and strutted it as conqueror.\n\nPoor Ch\u00e2teauroux only got the hate of the people for reward, Louis the\nhonours; for the people resented the public dishonour of her state.\n\nPower she found to be a dead-sea apple in her pretty mouth. The glory\nof it all, the splendours, were not the easily won delights for which\nshe had looked. She had to fight a duel, that never ended, with the\nking's witty, crafty, and scurrilous Prime Minister, the notorious\nMaurepas--and Maurepas willed that no woman should ever come between\nhim and the king--Maurepas who knew no mercy, no decency, no chivalry,\nno scruple. At Ch\u00e2teauroux's urging, Louis placed himself at the\nhead of the army; and France went near mad with joy that she had\nagain found a king. Crafty Maurepas urged on the business; the\nCh\u00e2teauroux suddenly realised his cunning glee--it separated her from\nthe king.\n\nOut of the whirl of things Boucher's fortune was ripening, little as\nhe might suspect it.\n\nHe was painting masterpieces that make his name live. To his fortieth\nyear belong the famed \"Birth of Venus,\" the \"Venus leaving the Bath,\"\nthe \"Muse Clio,\" the \"Muse Melpomene,\" and the three well-known\npastorals now at the Louvre--\"The Sleeping Shepherdess,\" the \"Nest,\"\n\n\nand the \"Shepherd and Shepherdesses.\" Of the many famous Venus-pieces\nthat his hand painted during these years it is not easy to write the\nlist. But having signed the \"Marriage of Love and Psyche\" at\nforty-one, he turned his experimental hand to the homely, realistic\nDutch style that was having a wide vogue, and painted the\n\"Dejeuner\"--a family of the prosperous class of the day at\nbreakfast--showing with rare charm the surroundings and home life of\nthe well-to-do of his time.\n\nAll goes well with Boucher. He changes into better quarters in the Rue\nde Grenelle-Saint-Honor\u00e9, where he lived for the next five years,\nuntil 1749; but his eyes are fixed upon a studio and apartments at\nthe old palace of the Louvre, though the hard intriguing of his\npowerful friends at Court on his behalf failed for some time. He had,\nindeed, to make another move before he arrived at his longed-for goal.\n\nPensions Boucher, like others, had found to be somewhat empty affairs;\nbut rooms at the Louvre were a solid possession eagerly sought after\nby the artists.\n\nIn this year of 1744 Boucher created a new fashion at the annual Salon\nby sending studies and sketches instead of finished pictures; and it\nset a value upon such things not before realised by artists, for\nsuccess was instant and loud.\n\nTowards the end of the next, Boucher's forty-second year, the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who was to take his leave of Paris,\ncommissioned four pictures to represent the day of a woman of fashion,\nand to be entitled \"Morning,\" \"Midday,\" \"Evening,\" and \"Night.\"\n\nBoucher painted one of these for him, now known as the \"Marchande de\nModes.\" The others were painted later, and all had a wide vogue as\nengravings. The correspondence has interest since it reveals Boucher's\nbusiness habits; he was paid for a picture on its delivery, and for\neach of these he was to receive 600 livres (double florins or\ndollars)--about a hundred and twenty pounds.\n\nIn an official document of the Director of Buildings to the king (or\nMinister of Fine Art, as we should say), written in this year of 1745,\nBoucher being forty-two, is a \"list of the best painters,\" in which\nBoucher is singled out for distinction as \"an historic painter, living\nin the Rue de Grenelle-Saint-Honor\u00e9, opposite the Rue des Deux-Ecus,\npupil of Lemoyne, excelling also in landscape, grotesques, and\nornaments in the manner of Watteau; and equally skilled in painting\nflowers, fruit, architecture, and subjects of gallantry and of\nfashion.\"\n\nNot so bad for dry officialdom; the critics could learn a lesson. For\nhe was nothing less. What indeed does he not do? and wondrous well!\nthis painter of the age.\n\nAnd the mighty rush of events is about to sweep him into further\nprominence; the very things which he probably passed by with a gay\nshrug are to enrich him, to help him to his highest fulfilment.\n\nPoor Ch\u00e2teauroux saw that she must lose the king's gadding favour in\nthe conflict with Maurepas unless she joined her lord, now with the\narmy. She realised full well that she had created the new Louis of\nAmbition--that her going must bring the people's hate to her. But she\ndared not lose the king. And she went. Maurepas had overdone his\njibings. The indiscretion at once rang through the land; became the\njest of the army--and Maurepas was not far from the bottom of the\nbusiness. The discreet indiscretion of covered ways between the king's\nlodgings and hers only added to the mockeries, and increased the\npeople's hate against, of course, the Ch\u00e2teauroux. Then upon a day in\nAugust the small-pox seized Louis at Metz; poor Ch\u00e2teauroux fought for\npossession of the king in the sick room, until his fear of\ndeath--Louis' sole piety--sent her packing--shrinking back in the\nhired carriage at each halting-place for change of horses, lest she\nshould be seen and torn from her place and destroyed by the populace.\n\nBut Louis recovered; Paris rang with bells at joy on his recovery, and\nhe entered the city amidst mad enthusiasm, hailed as The Well-Beloved.\n\nHe sent for the Ch\u00e2teauroux to find her dying, Maurepas having to\ndeliver the message of recall. She died suddenly and in great agony,\nswearing that Maurepas had poisoned her--died in the arms of her poor\ndiscarded sister, the De Mailly.\n\nBut this year of 1745 Boucher hears a mightier scandal that is to mean\nvast things to all France--and not least of all to Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE POMPADOUR\n\n\nA young bride had become the gossip of the rich merchant society of\nParis--that class that was ousting the old noblesse from power. She\nwas a beautiful, a remarkable woman; her wit was repeated in the\ndrawing-rooms, she had all the accomplishments; her charming\nname--Madame Lenormant d'Etioles.\n\nDraw aside the curtains of the past and we discover our little Jeanne\nPoisson--grown into this exquisite creature. It has come about in\nstrange fashion enough. The father--a scandalous fellow--having\nfingered the commissariat moneys in ugly ways to his own use, had been\nbanished for the ugly business. Nor is Jeanne's mother any better than\nshe should be; and the wags wink knowingly at the handsome and rich\nman of fashion, Monsieur Lenormant de Tournehem, who has been the\nfavoured gallant during the absence of the light-fingered Poisson.\n\nAnd, of a truth, Lenormant de Tournehem takes astonishing interest in\nthe little Jeanne--watching over her up-growing and giving her the\nbest of education at the convent, where she wins all hearts, and is\nknown as \"the little queen.\" The truth spoken with wondrous prophecy,\nif unthinkingly, as we shall see. Complacent Poisson came home, and\ntook the rich and fashionable, bland and smiling Lenormant de\nTournehem to his arms. Has he not wealth and estates? therefore as\nexcellent a friend for Poisson as for Madame Poisson. The girl Jeanne\nleaves the convent to be taught the accomplishments by the supreme\nmasters of France, the wits foregather at Madame Poisson's, and the\nbrilliant Jeanne is soon mistress of the arts--coquetry not least of\nall; has also the most exquisite taste in dress. Under all is a heart\ncold as steel; calculating as the higher mathematics. She has but one\nhindrance to ambition--her mean birth. Lenormant de Tournehem rids her\neven of this slur by making his nephew, Lenormant d'Etioles, marry\nher, giving the young couple half his fortune for dowry, and the\npromise of the rest when he dies--also he grants him a splendid\ntown-house, as splendid a country seat. And consequential\nself-respecting little Lenormant d'Etioles is lord of Etioles, amongst\nother seignories. So Jane Fish appears as Madame Lenormant d'Etioles,\nseductive, beautiful, accomplished, to whose house repair the new\nphilosophy, the wits, and artists. She has a certain sense of virtue;\nindeed openly vows that no one but the king shall ever come between\nher and her lord. But, deep in her heart, she has harboured a fierce\nambition--that the king shall help her to keep her bond. She puts\nforth all her gifts, all her powers, to win to the strange goal;\nconfides it to her worldly mother and \"uncle,\" Lenormant de Tournehem;\nfinds keen allies therein to the reaching of that strange goal. The\ndeath of the Ch\u00e2teauroux clears the way. At a masked ball the king is\nintrigued as to the personality of a beautiful woman who plagues him\nwith her art; he orders the unmasking. Madame Lenormant d'Etioles\nstands revealed, drops her handkerchief as by accident; the whisper\nruns through the Court that \"the handkerchief has been thrown!\" The\nking stoops and picks it up. A few evenings later she is smuggled into\nthe \"private apartments.\" She goes again a month later; in the morning\nis seized with sudden terror--she daren't go back to her angry lord\nlest he do her grievous harm; he will have missed her. The king is\ntouched; allows her to hide from henceforth in the secret apartments;\npromises the beautiful creature a lodging, her husband's banishment,\nand early acknowledgment as titular mistress--before the whole Court\nat Easter, says the pious Great One. But he has to join the army to\nplay the Conqueror at Fontenoy; and it is later in the year\n(September) before Madame d'Etioles is presented to the Court in a\nvast company and proceeds to the queen's apartments to kiss hands on\nappointment. Thus was Jeanne Poisson raised to the great aristocracy\nof France in her twenty-third year as Marquise de Pompadour.\n\nBoucher had been one of the brilliant group of artists of the\nd'Etioles' circle. That the Pompadour's influence had much effect upon\nhis position at Court for a year or two is unlikely; for she had to\nfight for possession of the king day and night, as the Ch\u00e2teauroux\nhad done, against the queen's party and the unscrupulous enmity of\nMaurepas. To set down Boucher's favour at Court to her is ridiculous.\n\nHe was painting for the queen's apartments at thirty-one when the\nPompadour was a school-girl of twelve. But in the year following her\nrise to power, Boucher painted four pictures for the large room of the\nDauphin, which were \"placed elsewhere\"; and, the year after that, he\nwas at work upon two pictures for the bedroom of the king at the\ncastle of Marly. It is likely enough that the Pompadour directed this\norder. She had almost immediately secured the office of the\nDirector-General of Buildings, which covered the direction of the\nroyal art treasures, for \"uncle\" Lenormant de Tournehem, who was also\na friend of the artist. And from this year it is significant that\nBoucher paints no more for the opposing camp of the Queen and Dauphin.\n\nHe was now giving all his strength to the \"Rape of Europa\" that he\npainted for the competition ordered by the Academy at the command of\nLenormant de Tournehem in the king's name, in which ten chosen\nAcademicians were to paint subjects in their own style for six prizes\nand a gold medal, to be awarded in secret vote by the competing\nartists themselves. Boucher won, by his amiable nature, the good-will\nof them all by proposing that they should so arrange as to share the\nprizes equally, and thus prevent any sense of soreness inevitable in\nthe losers.\n\nBut greatly as he won the good-fellowship of his fellow-artists by it,\nthis picture caused a murmur to rise amongst the critics who,\naforetime loud in his praise, now began to complain of his \"abuse of\nrose tints\" in the painting of the female nude. The fact was that\nDiderot and the men of the New Philosophy were turning their eyes to\nthe whole foundations upon which France was built, art as well as\nsociety, and were beginning to demand of art \"grandeur and morality in\nits subjects.\" They were soon to be clamouring for \"the statement of a\ngreat maxim, a lesson for the spectator.\" Diderot, with bull-like\ncourage, picked out the greatest, and turned upon Boucher, blaming him\nfor triviality.\n\nThe nations, weary of war, concluded the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in\nthe October of 1748. No sooner was peace concluded than Louis\nrelapsed into his old habit of dandified indolence and profligate\nease; and, putting from him his duties as the lord of a great people,\nhe gave himself up to shameless intrigues. He allowed the Pompadour to\nusurp his magnificence and to rule over the land. He yielded himself\nutterly, if sometimes sulkily, to her domination; and for sixteen\nyears she was the most powerful person at Court, the greatest force in\nthe state--making and unmaking ministers, disposing of office,\nhonours, titles, pensions. All political affairs were discussed and\narranged under her guidance; ministers, ambassadors, generals\ntransacted their business in her stately boudoirs; the whole patronage\nof the sovereign was dispensed by her pretty hands; the prizes of the\nChurch, of the army, of the magistracy could be obtained solely\nthrough her favour and good-will. Her energy must have been\nprodigious. Possessed of extraordinary talents and exquisite tastes,\nshe gave full rein to them, and it was in the indulgence of her better\nqualities that Destiny brought Boucher into the friendship of this\nwonderful woman. She became not only his patron but his pupil,\nengraving several of his designs.\n\nBut this, her sovereignty over the king, easy and light in its outward\nseeming, was a haggard nightmare to the calculating woman who had so\nlonged for it. She knew no single hour's rest from the night she won\nto the king's bed. She had to fight her enemies, secret and open, for\npossession of the king's will, day and night; and she fought--with\nrare courage. She won by consummate skill and unending pluck. She made\nherself an essential part of the king's freedom from care. The Court\nparty fought her for power with constant vigilance. Maurepas brought\nall his unscrupulous art, all his ironic mimicry, all his vile jibes\nand unchivalrous hatred to bear against her. He had made himself a\nnecessity to the king; and he never slept away a chance of injuring\nher. He knew no mercy, no nobility, no pity. He made her the detested\nobject of the people. With his own hands he penned the witty verses\nand epigrams that were sung and flung about the streets of Paris.\n\nBut she had an enemy more subtle than any at the Court--hour by hour\nshe had to dispute the king with the king's boredom. And it was in the\neffort to do so that she created her celebrated theatre in the\nprivate apartments, calling Boucher and others to her aid in the doing\nof it. Here the noblest of France vied with each other to obtain the\nsmallest part to play, an instrument in its orchestra, an invitation\nto its performances.\n\nBoucher left the Opera to become its decorator in 1748, and did not\nreturn until her death. For her, he also decorated her beautiful rooms\nat Bellevue. She bought at high prices many of his greatest\nmasterpieces.\n\nThe Pompadour's power so greatly increased that she openly took\ncommand of the king's will; dared and succeeded in getting his\nfavourite Maurepas banished; and herself took to the use of the kingly\n\"we.\" Her rascally father was created Lord of Marigny; her brother,\nwhom the king liked well and called \"little brother,\" was created\nMarquis de Vandi\u00e8res; her only child, Alexandrine, signed her name as\na princess of the blood royal, and would have been married to the\nblood royal had she not caught the small-pox and died. She amassed a\nprivate fortune, castles, and estates such as no mistress had dreamed\nof; and into them she poured art treasures that cost the nation\nthirty-six millions of money. She created the porcelain factory of\nS\u00e8vres, kept keen watch over the Gobelins looms, and founded the great\nMilitary School of St. Cyr amidst work that would have kept several\nstatesmen busy, and of deadly intrigues at Court that would have\nbroken the spirit of many a brilliant man.\n\nIt was in her hectic desire to keep the king from being bored that she\nstooped, and made Boucher stoop, to the employment of his high\nartistry in the painting of a series of indecent pictures wherewith to\ntickle the jaded desires of Boredom, and thereby gave rise to the\nwidespread impression that Boucher's art was ever infected by base\ndesign. But Boucher was, at his very worst, but a healthy animal; and\neven in these secret works for the king he did not reach so low as did\nmany an artist of more pious memory who painted with no excuse but his\nown pleasure.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the Pompadour has been blamed too much for this\nevil act, and too much forgotten for her splendid patronage of the man\nwho, under it and during these great years of his forties, produced a\nseries of masterpieces that place him in the foremost rank of the\npainters of his century. It is impossible to reckon the number of the\npastorals and Venus-pieces that his master-hand painted and loved to\npaint, during these the supreme years of his genius. It is significant\nthat they were painted during the years that saw the Pompadour in\nsupreme power.\n\nBoucher was so firmly established in 1750, his forty-seventh year,\nthat he moved into a new house in the Rue Richelieu, near the Palais\nRoyal. Disappointed in not receiving a studio and apartments at the\nLouvre, he was allowed to use a studio in the king's library. He was\nnow making money so easily that he was able to collect pictures and\nprecious stones and the gaily coloured curiosities that appealed to\nhis tastes.\n\nThe critics were becoming more and more censorious; and one of them\nhits true with the comment that in his pastorals his shepherdesses\nlook as if they had stepped over from the Opera and would soon be off\nagain thereto.\n\nIn his forty-eighth year Boucher's art was at its most luminous\nstage--his atmosphere clear and subtle and exquisitely rendered; his\nyellows golden; his whites satin-like and silvery; his flesh-tones\nupon the nude bodies of his goddesses unsurpassed by previous art. The\nbeauty of it all was not to last much longer.\n\nLenormant de Tournehem died suddenly in the November of 1751; the\nPompadour's brother, Abel Poisson de Vandi\u00e8res, was appointed\nDirector-General in his stead at the age of twenty-five--and soon\nafterwards, on the death of his father, created Marquis de Marigny--a\nshy, handsome youth, a gentleman and an honourable fellow, whom the\nking liked well, and against whom his sister's sole complaint was that\nhe lacked the brazen effrontery of the courtiers of the day. No man\ndid more for the advancement of the art of his time. A pension of a\nthousand livres falling vacant, the young fellow secured it for\nBoucher; and almost immediately afterwards, a studio becoming vacant\nat the Louvre owing to the death of Coypel, first painter to the king,\nBoucher came to his coveted home, eagerly moving in with his family as\nsoon as its wretched state could be put into repair.\n\nThe decoration of the new wing to the palace at Fontainebleau brought\nthe commission for the painting of the ceiling and the principal\npicture in the Council Chamber to Boucher, who had already decorated\nthe Dining-Room. This was the period of his painting the \"Rising\" and\nthe \"Setting of the Sun\" for the Pompadour, now in the Watteau\ncollection, two canvases that were always favourites with the painter,\nbitterly as they were assailed by the critic Grimm.\n\nHe was turning out so much work that it was impossible to give as much\ncare to his pictures as he ought. For he refused sternly, his life\nlong, to raise his prices; by consequence he had to create a larger\namount of work in order to meet his expenditure. It was about this\ntime that Reynolds, passing through Paris, went to visit him and found\nhim painting on a huge canvas without models or sketches. \"On\nexpressing my surprise,\" writes Reynolds, \"he replied that he had\nconsidered the model as necessary during his youth until he had\ncompleted his study of art, but that he had not used one for a long\ntime past.\"\n\nHe soon had not the time, not only to paint from nature but even to\ngive his pictures the work necessary to complete them. The feverish\nhaste which took possession of him in his frantic endeavour to meet\nthe vast demand for his pictures, and the eager efforts of his\nengravers to satisfy the public call for engravings after his works,\ngave him less and less leisure to joy in their doing. And his eyesight\nbegan to fail. His flesh-tints deepened to a reddish hue; and he\nstands baffled before his work, suspecting his sight, since what every\none cries out upon as being bright vermilion, he only sees as a dull\nearthy colour. Boucher has topped the height of his achievement; he\nhas to \"descend the other side of the hill.\" Boucher begins to grow\nold.\n\nIn Boucher's fifty-first year an ugly intrigue of the queen's party at\nCourt to sap the Pompadour's influence over the king by drawing away\nthe king's affections towards Madame de Choiseul-Romanet, a reckless\nyoung beauty of the Court, brought about a strange alliance. The Count\nde Stainville, one of the Pompadour's bitterest enemies, was shown the\nking's letter of invitation to his young kinswoman; and he, deeply\nwounded in his pride that his kinswoman should have been offered to\nthe king, went to the Pompadour and exposed the plot. A close\nalliance followed; and De Stainville thenceforth became her chief\nguide in affairs of state. It was at her instance that the king called\nhim to be his Prime Minister, raising him to the Duchy of Choiseul--a\nname he made illustrious as one of the greatest Ministers of France.\n\nIn his fifty-second year Boucher was appointed to the directorship of\nthe Gobelins looms, to the huge delight of the weavers and all\nconcerned with the tapestry factory. This was the year of his painting\nthe famous portrait of the Pompadour, to whom he several times paid\nthis \"tribute of immorality.\" For the Gobelins looms he produced many\nhandsome designs; and he was painting with astounding industry. But\nhis hand's skill began to falter. His art shows weariness in his\nsixtieth year, and sickness fell upon him, and held him in servitude\nnow with rare moments of respite. The critics, notoriously Diderot,\nwere now attacking him with shameless virulence. Boucher passed it all\nby; but he felt the change that was taking place in the public taste.\n\nThe ideas of the New Philosophy were infecting public opinion; the Man\nof Feeling had arisen in the land; and France, humiliated in war, and\nresenting the follies and the greed of her shameless privileged class,\nwas openly resenting it and all its works. Choiseul had planted his\nstrength deep in the people's party, and was come near to being its\ngod. His masterly mind had checked Frederick of Prussia to the North;\nand the nations, exhausted by the struggle, signed the Peace of Paris\nin 1763. Choiseul, with France at peace abroad, turned to the blotting\nout of the turbulent order of the Jesuits at home. Their attempt to\nend the Pompadour's relations with the king made this powerful woman\neager to complete his design; the chance was soon to come, and the\nOrder was abolished from France and its vast property seized by the\nstate.\n\nThe Pompadour lived but a short while to enjoy her triumph. Worn out\nby her superhuman activities, assailed by debt, she fell ill of a\nracking cough, dying on the 15th of April, 1764, in her forty-second\nyear, keeping her ascendancy over the king and the supreme power in\nFrance to her last hour. Death found her transacting affairs of state.\n\nLouis, weary of his servitude, had only a heartless epigram to cast\nat the body of the dead woman as she passed to her last resting-place.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE END\n\n\nThe death of the Pompadour robbed Boucher of a friend; but her\nbrother, Marigny, remained faithfully attached to the old artist, and\nseized every chance to honour him. On the death of Carle van Loo,\nBoucher, at sixty-two, was made first painter to the king, with all\nhis pensions and privileges that were consistent with this the supreme\nappointment in the art world.\n\nThere had been serious intention of making Boucher the head of the\nEcole des El\u00e8ves Proteg\u00e9s; he had the art of making himself liked and\nof inspiring the love of the arts. He was very popular with the\nstudents and artists, owing to his kindliness, his eagerness to render\nservice, his readiness to encourage the youngsters or to console them.\n\nWhen the riot took place, provoked by the Academicians by their award\nof the Prix de Rome in 1767, the students insulted the Academicians,\nbut hailed Boucher with enthusiastic applause. The reason was not far\nto seek. When a student came to the old master for advice he did not\n\"play the pontiff,\" and, scorning the false dignity of big phrases, he\ntook the brush in his hand and showed the way out of all difficulties\nby simplehearted example, despising rules, and putting himself out in\norder to make things clear to a young artist.\n\nHowever, the Academicians feared he would be an unorthodox master for\nyouth, and appointed another in his place.\n\nA long and serious illness thwarted his keen energies. Diderot was\ngiving himself up to outrageous violence against him. If the old\npainter exhibited at the Salon, Diderot fiercely assailed his art; if\nhe did not exhibit, Diderot as bitterly assailed him for his\nnegligences. Above all, he attacked Boucher in that he did not paint\nwhat Diderot would have painted--but could not. \"When he paints\ninfants,\" cries Diderot, \"you will not find one employed in a real act\nof life--studying his lesson, reading, writing, stripping hemp.\"\n\nPoor unfortunate infants! for whom Philosophy could find no happier\njoy in life than stripping hemp! Boucher was but an artist. He\npainted his generation as far as he could see it, and, with all his\nfaults and weaknesses, he never debauched his art with foreign and\nalien things that had no part in the nation's life; he painted fair\nFrance into his landscapes, not a make-believe land he did not know\nwith preposterous Greek ruins; and best of all, to his eternal honour,\nhe painted infants glad in their gladness to be alive, with no desire\nto send their happy little bodies to school, with no sickly ambition\nto make them into budding philosophers, with no thought of making them\npose and lie as Men of Feeling. He had no joy in setting their little\nbodies to toil--in making them \"teach a lesson to the spectator,\" in\nmaking them stoop their little shoulders to the \"picking of hemp.\"\n\nHe continued to paint as he had always painted--except that he painted\nless well. The wreath of roses was wilting on a grey head. The blood\njigged less warmly in the frail body. The features showed pallid--the\neyes haggard. The sight failed. The hand alone kept something of its\ncunning.\n\nHe went to Holland with his friend Randon du Boisset, but health\nshrank farther from him. Diderot had near spent his last jibe.\n\nIn 1768, Boucher's sixty-fifth year, the neglected queen went to her\ngrave. The king's grief and contrition and vows to amend his life came\ntoo late, and lasted little longer than the drying of the floods of\ntears over the body of his dead consort. A year later he was become\nthe creature of a pretty woman of the gutters, whom he caused to be\nmarried to the Count du Barry--the infamously famous Madame du Barry.\n\nBut neither the remonstrances of Choiseul with the king against this\nfurther degradation of the throne of France, nor his unconcealed scorn\nof the upstart countess, nor the dangerous enemy he made for himself\nthereby, signified now to Boucher, first painter to the king.\n\nBoucher was failing. His son was a prig and a disappointment. His two\nfavourite pupils, Baudoin and Deshayes, who had married his two girls,\ndied.\n\nTo the Salon of 1769 he sent his \"Caravan of Bohemians.\" It was his\nlast display. He had been going about for some time like a gaunt ghost\nof his former self, afflicted with all the ills inevitable to a life\nfeverishly consumed in work and the pursuit of pleasure.\n\nThey went to his studio at five of the clock one May morning, and\nfound him seated at his easel, before a canvas of Venus, dead, with\nthe paint-filled brush fallen out of his fingers.\n\nSo passed he away on the 30th of May 1770, in his sixty-seventh year.\n\nWhen Boucher died, the generation of which he was the limner was near\ncome to its violent end. The rosy carnivals and gay gallantries of his\nage gave way to the blood-stained romance and fierce tempest of the\nRevolution. The garrets of the old curiosity-shops received the\ndiscarded canvases of the master. His shepherds and shepherdesses were\nput to rout by the Romans of his pupil, citizen David. The old order\nwas brought into contempt and overthrown. And with it, Boucher's art,\nlike much that was gracious and charming and good in the evil thing,\nwent down also, and was overwhelmed for a while.\n\nFor a while only. For just as, out of the blood and terror of the\nRevolution, a real France arose, phnix-wise, from the ruin, and in\nbeing born, whilst putting off the vilenesses of the thing from which\nshe sprang, took on also to herself the gracious and winsome qualities\nthat place her amongst the most fascinating peoples of the ages; so\nBoucher has come into his kingdom again--the most gracious of painters\nthat the years have yielded."

                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n        a. One bed, or folding cot,\n        b. One oil stove,\n        c. One lamp,\n        d. Enough supplies of all kinds sufficient for six months,\n        e. Pots, pans, kettles, etc.\nIt is needless to say that positions in Manila and Iloilo were now at\na premium.\n\nWas it possible that teachers were to be sent to places where even the\nnecessaries of life could not be obtained! Was it possible that many\nwould be sent to places so remote that for six months no fresh\nsupplies could be gotten! A mass meeting was held at once, and a\ncommittee was appointed to send a cablegram to the Associated Press\npetitioning aid from the American people at large. Realizing what\nconsternation would be created throughout the United States by such a\nmessage, two of the teachers leaped into a carriage at the close of\nthe meeting and a few moments later were closeted with the chief\nexecutive of the department. As a result the committee was persuaded\nnot to send the cablegram to the Associated Press until by courtesy it\nhad been sent to the President. Of course, this diplomatic move tided\naffairs over and the teachers who had flatly refused to budge from\nManila now agreed to go on to their stations, being assured that\nwhatever action was best would be taken.\n\nThe day had come when we must separate. We were to enter an untried\nand an unknown field. It was fitting that we have a final joyous\nmeeting, so the best orchestra in the archipelago was engaged and we\n\"chased the hours with flying feet\" until dawn so that whatever might\ncome to us in that unknown future upon which we were entering each\nwould hold in pleasant memory our last evening together.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER III. - A DRAMA IN ACTUAL LIFE.\n\n\nAlmost every one heeded the warning to go to his station forearmed\nwith at least necessaries of life, but, as it had never fallen to the\nlot of the writer to cook, he refused to learn at that late day, so he\ntook no pot, no pan, no kettle, putting his future into the hands of\nan uncertain fate and relying upon the unknown hospitality of the\nFilipino.\n\nBacalod, the capital of the province of Occidental Negros, was our\ndestination. The second morning after leaving Manila, we awoke with\nthe \"Kilpatrick\" lying at anchor in a shallow bay. We were several\nmiles from the shore and nothing in sight indicated that we had\nreached a place of any importance. Late the night before we had been\nawakened by the loud, sharp ringing of the ship's bells, accompanied\nby the reversal of the engines and a general disturbance awaking the\ncrew. So our first impressions on coming on deck were that we had run\naground. But the captain assured us that everything was ship-shape and\nthat this was the nearest point of approach to Capiz, a town of\nconsiderable importance on the island of Panay, where a body of troops\nwas to embark for home. Not even the grass hut of a native was in\nsight. Search as we would, not a sign was seen of a stream flowing\ninto the sea, indicating the probable presence of a town. There was\nnot a sign of life of any kind save one lone column of thin, blue\nsmoke that arose from the side of a mountain miles away. One would\nhave thought that we were explorers of three hundred years ago lying\noff the shore of some unknown land.\n\nAfter breakfast the steam launch, together with all the boats, was\nlowered, and several of us who had determined to miss no opportunity\nto gather information about the islands took our places in the launch\nby the side of the ship's mate, and steamed away across the water with\na long line of boats strung out in the rear. We headed away toward a\ngroup of cocoanut trees, and about an hour later stepped ashore on a\npile of decayed coral rocks that extended some twenty or thirty feet\nout into the water, thus forming the only landing place of a town of\nseveral thousands of people and of considerable commercial importance.\n\nA few moments after we had landed, an army wagon drawn by a\nmagnificent pair of mules came up out of a tropical jungle along a\nnarrow road. We clambered into the wagon and were soon lost in the\ndepths of foliage from which we had just seen the vehicle emerge.\n\nLong waving bamboos with their plumy leafage hung over the road from\neach side, meeting and overlapping in the center until they formed an\narchway so dense that the tropical sun now high in the heavens\npenetrated it only at intervals. At times the wagon sank up to the\nhubs in the soft earth, and the muscles of the mules stood out like\nwhip-cords under the skin as they drew us forward.\n\nAt a sharp turn in the road we came upon the first division of troops\nthat was to embark for home. The look of joy upon their sun-browned\nfaces was inexpressible. Their work was done, and with elastic step\nand smiling faces they saluted us as they passed by. The reign of\nforce was at an end; it was going out with them; the reign of peace\nhad begun; it was coming in with us.\n\nIn the afternoon when we returned from the town the last of the troops\nhad arrived and, as we drove up, the bugle was sounding the call to\nsupper. We noticed native women mingling with the troops and, indeed,\na native woman was in constant attention waiting upon one of the\nsoldiers with whom we ate. Her clothes were clean, her hair was nicely\ncombed, and her general appearance was neat. She seemed to anticipate\nthe slightest wish of the soldier with whom she was. She brought him\nwater to drink, cleaned his plate after the meal and saw that his\nknife, fork, and spoon were put into his haversack.\n\nWe had now finished supper and the launch had returned for the last\nload of troops. The lieutenant in command of the company gave the\norder to \"fall in\"; the men shouldered their rifles and fell into\nline. \"Forward, march!\" called the lieutenant, and the column swept\nforward towards the boats. The women had until now restrained\nthemselves, but, as their husbands marched away never to return, their\nfeelings could no longer be restrained. One young woman of about\neighteen, who was leaning against a rock by the roadside sobbing, when\nher husband passed, leaped up in frenzy of passionate love and caught\nthe rifle from his shoulder. Her first impulse seemed to be to throw\nthe gun away, but suddenly realizing the futility of such an act she\nburst into tears, shouldered the rifle herself and marched on by his\nside. Another woman of more mature age threw her arms around the legs\nof a tall stalwart man, and drew him bodily from the line.\n\nBut the troops marched on and entered the boats. One woman who had\nbeen unnoticed before came down into the shallow water and caught hold\nof our last boat as if to prevent its leaving, while others stood\nmingling their sobs with the sounds of the wavelets as they broke on\nthe sands. As we passed away, an expectant mother, standing in bold\noutline against the twilight sky, threw up her hands in an agony of\ndespair and then sank upon the stones. The curtain had fallen upon a\ndrama in actual life deeper in pathos than any other we had ever seen\nor ever expected to see. Depth of passion, depth of love! Who can\nfathom the human heart?\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. - WHAT THE TEACHERS DID.\n\n\nThere is a remarkable sameness about the towns in the Philippines.\n\nThey all have a large open square about the middle of the town, around\nthree sides of which are Chinese stores, unless one side lies open to\nthe sea, and on the fourth is the great stone ecclesia. The streets\nrun at right angles to one another and divide up the town into\ncreditable squares.\n\nEverybody in the Philippines lives up-stairs, for the ground is so\nsoaked with water during the rainy season that it is a menace to\nhealth to live upon the ground floor. So even the poorest nippa hut\nis built upon stakes four or five feet above the ground.\n\nBacalod is a typical Philippine town. As we landed, a broad open\nsquare was spread out before us. Two sides of the square were lined\nwith two-story houses in which were Chinese stores below and Filipino\nhomes above. On the third side stood the great stone church in whose\nmassive tower the clock was striking the hour of four, while the\nfourth lay open to the sea that had borne us thither.\n\nWe landed, but it was in a method new to us and one not usually\nemployed by the traveling public.\n\nWhen our sail boat ran aground on the sandy bottom a hundred yards or\nmore from the shore, a crowd of Filipino men who were on the beach\nslowly rolled up their pantaloons and waded out to the rescue,--for\nthe money that was in it. The boat's crew elevated their trousers'\nlegs also and slided down into the water. Each of us then straddled\nthe neck of a Filipino standing in the water and was held by ankles to\nbe steadied while our biped mounts proceeded to the shore.\n\nWe were now on the ground and face to face with the situation. To give\nthe reader an idea of the actual conditions met by the first teachers\nwho went to the Islands, the following is copied from the instructions\ngiven us in Manila:\n    1. There shall be two sessions daily of all schools, and the\n    last hour of the morning session shall be devoted solely to\n    instructing the Filipino teachers.\n\n    2. In cases where teachers are sent to a town in which there\n    is no school-house, they are expected to secure the aid of the\n    people and have one built.\n\n    3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is\n    stopped.\n\n    4. All supplies must be kept under lock and key. In towns\n    where there is no case or box to lock the supplies in, and it\n    is also impossible to get the town council to furnish a case,\n    a requisition may be sent to Manila, and, if an appropriation\n    can be secured, one will be made and sent out.\n\nThus it can be easily seen that we were indeed pioneers. In many\nplaces no school-house was to be found, and in some cases it was even\ndifficult to get the town council to provide a case in which to keep\nthe supplies.\n\nThe work of the teachers was, in short; to \"make the English language\nthe basis of instruction in the public schools.\" On our arrival at\nBacalod two schools were found in progress, for some soldiers had been\ndetailed for the work here previous to our coming. One of these was\nfor boys and the other, for girls. Thus the work here had been in a\nmeasure simplified, but complications that had arisen at Talisay, one\nof the largest and richest towns on the island, demanded a change of\nteachers and the writer was assigned to the place as superintendent.\n\nHere an attempt had been made to start a school but it had failed\nignominiously and a system of education was to be put into operation\nfrom the very start.\n\nThe Filipinos are not strong advocates of co-education, so separate\nschools were to be started for the boys and the girls. The one for the\nboys was gotten well in hand before the one for the girls was\nattempted at all.\n\nA few days after reaching the town and securing a home the\npresidente of the town had it publicly announced that the following\nMonday morning at eight o'clock a public school for boys would be\nopened in a building that had been rented for the purpose by the\nmunicipal council. About the middle of the afternoon of the same day a\nman beat a little drum throughout all the streets of the town to call\nthe people out and the town clerk announced both in Spanish and in the\nnative language that this public school would begin at the time and\nplace mentioned above; that instruction would be free to all who came;\nthat the government would furnish all supplies; and that instruction\nwould be given in the English language. A native principal and\nassistants were employed and everything was ready to begin.\n\nThe official report of the result is as follows:\n    Boys' public school of Talisay, Negros, P. I., began November\n    4, 1901. Forty-three boys present at eight o'clock. Forty-one\n    of them knew \"good morning\" and \"good afternoon\" but do not\n    know the distinction between them. Two of them speak simple\n    Spanish. At eight forty-five, eight more, who had been\n    attending an early morning private school, came in together.\n\n    The books they brought were so varied and so different from\n    one another that it seemed impossible to bring any reasonable\n    degree of order out of such a chaos, and so, after struggling\n    vainly for about a week with the problem, the superintendent\n    by one fell stroke removed everything in use and put in a\n    uniform system, and from that day on the English language has\n    been the basis of instruction in the public schools of\n    Talisay. The work was of necessity very slow at first, but by\n    the end of a year two schools were going nicely and a number\n    of the brightest boys and girls had made really excellent\n    progress.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER V. - A \"BAILE.\"\n\n\nNot long after the arrival of our party at Bacalod we received an\ninvitation to a \"baile\" given in our honor by the inhabitants of\nSilay, a town some ten or twelve miles up the northern coast and one\nnoted for its social life. The invitation was accepted with pleasure,\nand about the middle of the afternoon on the day appointed we were\nclad in the immaculate white of the tropics and steaming away up the\ncoast on board a launch sent for our conveyance. Twilight was still\nlingering on the path of day when we anchored just off shore at the\ntown. A row-boat containing the officials of the city came out to meet\nus and, in due season, we were ushered into a spacious drawing-room\nfilled almost to overflowing with the \u00e9lite of the town. The \u00e9lite of\ntowns in the Philippines speak Spanish, and, as only one or two of our\nparty could at that time boast of more than a formal acquaintance with\nthe Castilian tongue, the exchange of ideas that evening between us\nand the Filipinos was of necessity not very rapid.\n\nThe necessity of easy communication between us was rendered somewhat\nless indispensable by the announcement of supper as soon as we were\nrested from our trip. When we had taken our places at the table a\nyoung Filipino about twenty-five years of age arose and gave a lengthy\ntoast to the recent union of the Philippines with the United States.\n\nBut as we Americans were unable to scale the dizzy heights of his\nclimaxes or sink to the depths of his pathos, we forewent the\npleasures of his oratory and turned our attention to the savory odor\nof lamb, chicken, and roast pig that came slyly stealing up our\nnostrils to send us nerve dispatches about the gastronomic delights of\nour not far distant future.\n\nAt last the toast was ended and the world-wide soup ushered in a long\ntrain of things good to eat, served in a style better fitted to the\ndelights of the appetite than to the formalities of dinners, for, as\nsoon as the pleasant task of one dish was completed by any one, the\nnext was served him at once regardless of the progress made by the\nothers at the table.\n\nThe last course was dulce. The new-comers to the Philippines will\nnot be long in making the acquaintance of this dish, and at all\nmeetings, both public and private, where eatables are served, it\nperforms an important part. It is anything sweet, and it may vary all\nthe way from an india-rubber-like black mixture of cocoanut milk and\ndirty sugar to a really toothsome and respectable confection. No\nmatter of what materials a dish is composed, just so long as it is\nsweet, it is dulce.\n\nAfter paying our respects to this last course, we arose from the table\nand entered a great rectangular room from the center of whose ceiling\nhung a large glass chandelier, a mass of shimmering crystals. In the\nchairs around the room were the wealth, the youth, and the beauty of\nthe town.\n\nThe first and also the last number of every Filipino dance of any\nformality is the \"rigodon.\" The dancers are arranged in a square, or\nquadrangle according to the number participating, and are then led\nthrough a tangled maze of figures that so utterly bewilders the novice\nthat he sinks into his chair at the end of the dance wondering how it\nall came to pass.\n\nWe Americans breathed a sigh of relief when the \"rigodon\" ended, and\nmustered fresh courage for social conquests in the waltz that was now\nbreathing forth from the trembling strings. My companion in the first\ndance had been the young lady by whose side I had sat at dinner. But\nit now became necessary to search for another, so I prudently waited\nto see how partners were chosen, and made no mistake when a few\nmoments later I faced one of the most luscious looking se\u00f1oritas on\nthe opposite side of the room and offered her my arm. My eyes must\nhave told the story that my lips could not utter in Spanish, for she\nsmiled upon me sweetly, arose, and put her hand upon my shoulder. My\narm encircled her waist and I began to waltz. Unfortunately my\ncompanion did not follow, but began to hop up and down in a manner\nmost distressing. Supposing the attack to be only temporary, I paused\nand, much to my relief, she soon showed signs of recovery; and in the\ncourse of time she came to a standstill looking up into my face in an\ninquiring sort of way, apparently wondering why St. Vitus had not paid\nhis respects to me also. A second attempt to follow the music met with\nresults similar to the first, and during the third attempt, which\nseemed to be trembling on the verge of a failure, St. Vitus let go my\ncompanion and seized me with such vigor that she, who was small even\nfor a Filipino, was gathered up bodily and taken around the room at\nsuch a pace that her toes touched the floor only at far distant\nintervals.\n\nAt this point my devotion to the shrine of Terpsichore ceased from\nforce of circumstances and I seated myself in one of the most\ncomfortable chairs in sight that I might carry out a previously formed\nplan to study the Filipino somewhat critically as he appears in\nsociety.\n\nThe first thing that impressed me as the dancers passed up and down\nthe room was the flash of diamonds. Nearly every woman in the room had\non a brooch that flashed the colors of the rainbow at every turn.\n\nAlmost all of them wore one or more rings that showed up brilliantly\nunder the chandelier. Many of the men too, especially the young men,\nwore gems that appeared to be exquisite. A closer inspection showed\nthat some of the gems had flaws and others were of a poor color, but\nno one would have denied that, taken as a whole, it was a really\nbeautiful display.\n\nThe dress of the ladies was richly colored. Many of their skirts were\nof silk covered with hand embroidered flowers, and their filmy pina\nwaists and broad collar pieces were rich with needle-work. They all\nwore a kind of heelless velvet slipper, very common as a dress shoe in\nthe Philippines, or high-heeled patent leather shoes with neatly\nfitting black stockings.\n\nThe men were dressed in white coats and white pantaloons or black\ncoats and white pantaloons. White shirts and collars, together with\nall sorts and styles of cravats and low-cut patent leather shoes with\nhighly colored socks completed their dress.\n\nIt was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money;\nthat they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a\ntable loaded with good things was a fact to which all of us were\nenthusiastic witnesses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VI. - A SKETCH OF LIFE IN THE PHILIPPINES.\n\n\nHouse-keeping in the Philippines presents some interesting phases. Our\nclub of American officials decided to run a mess, so we employed a\ncook and a house boy, then each of us provided himself with a personal\nservant, making a total of six servants for four men--it takes about\nthis proportion of servants to live in any sort of comfort in the\nPhilippines--and launched ourselves boldly upon the sea of domestic\neconomy. But there were shoals ahead of us, for the question of\nregulating servants is one of no small importance in the Philippines,\nand one of its most disadvantageous features is the long chain of\ndependents that usually attends it.\n\nWe gave the cooks so much a day with which to buy supplies in the\nlocal market, for our own table, making him render a daily list of\nexpenditures, and a fixed amount besides to purchase rice and fish for\nhimself and the other servants. Of course, if they wished to vary\ntheir diet and get chicken and fresh pork, which could be had at far\ndistant intervals, it was wholly a matter of their option, but the\nallowance was made on the basis of so much rice and fish a day for\neach. This allowance was about fifteen cents a day in Spanish coin per\nservant.\n\nThus far all was well. We had agreed to give the cook eight dollars a\nmonth in Spanish money, thinking that good wages would procure good\nservice, but the visions of affluence that floated before him on such\nfloods of wealth were so alluring that they drew him from the kitchen\nto the cooler veranda. In less than a week he had employed an\nassistant at four dollars a month; in less than another week that\nassistant had employed him an assistant at two dollars a month; in\nless than another week that assistant to the assistant had employed\nhim an assistant at the princely salary of fifty cents a month; and\nfrom fear that the chain of dependents would end only by our having\nthe whole Filipino race attached to our culinary force, we broke up\nhouse-keeping and went boarding again, choosing that as the less of\nthe two evils.\n\nOur house furnishings were almost wholly Philippine. The table ware\nand the food on the table came from the ends of the earth. The knives\nand forks were made in Germany, the plates were manufactured in\nEngland, the glass ware and table cloth, in the United States. The\noatmeal and flour came from the United States also. The butter came\nfrom Australia, the rice from China, the salt from Russia, and the\nother eatables from sources about as various as their separate names.\n\nSwitzerland furnished the condensed milk and Illinois the canned\ncream. Nearly all of the canned fruit bore labels from Spain.\n\nThus it can easily be seen that life in the Philippines, if lived\naccording to American ideals, is dependent upon a highly developed and\nhighly complex commerce. However, the difficulties of transportation\nand the restriction of large stocks of merchandise to Manila and some\nhalf a dozen other towns, make so great a difference between country\nlife and city life that a short comparison of the two will not be out\nof place, and life in Manila may well be taken as being fairly typical\nof the latter.\n\nLife in Manila is pleasant, but expensive. It is pleasant from the\nfact that it is not only the capital but also metropolis of the\narchipelago. Thus the combination of wealth and high official position\nhas given to Manila a society of the highest and most refined type.\n\nThe process of beautifying and improving the city which is constantly\ngoing on bids fair to give us at no distant day a city of which we may\nwell be proud.\n\nBut let him who intends living well in Manila on a small income bid\nfarewell at once to so idylic a dream, for it costs much to live well\nthere. In the city of Manila one can get almost anything he wishes,\nbut it must be paid for at the price it commands. Especially in the\ncase of eatables, this price is by no means small, because to the\nfirst cost of articles must in most cases be added the expense of\ndistant shipment from American, European, or Australian ports, and not\ninfrequently the cost of long refrigeration must also be taken into\nconsideration. But, expensive though it is, it is very pleasant to\nlive there and those who have once enjoyed it often wish again to\nquaff the cup of its delights.\n\nIn strong contrast to this pleasant life is the life of the quiet\nlittle hamlet away in the distant islands. Indeed, the Filipino from\nthe distant town, who by some good fortune has been to Manila, or, by\na coup de main, has studied in one of the Manila colleges, is looked\nup to in a true hero-worshiping attitude by all who either know him or\nhear of his fame. Life in such a place is one long state of harmless\ninactivity. Not a wave of trouble from the great outer world ever\ndisturbs its peaceful repose. One lounges forever in an air of\nindolent ease and extreme aversion to anything approaching what might\nbe called a respectable effort.\n\nOne arises in the morning about the time the sun's first rays silver\nthe top leaves of the cocoanut trees and then stirs around until nine\nor ten o'clock, when it is found expedient to avoid a further exposure\nto the sun. From then until about five o'clock in the afternoon it is\nbest to take things as they come, even though one of those things be a\nFilipino dinner. But then you may have your vehiclo attached to a\nyoung bull with a ring in his nose and go for a drive. If it is the\ndry season you will probably enjoy the drive unless you object to the\nfrequent clouds of dust swept along by the evening wind. If it is in\nthe rainy season your pleasure will depend to a considerable extent\nupon how wet you get; but, whether the season be wet or dry, your\npleasure will be regulated largely by the state of harmony existing\nbetween the driver and the bull.\n\nIn these quiet secluded nooks successive generations of Filipinos are\nborn, reared, grow old and die in an even chain of events broken only\nby the occasional erection of a new grass house on the identical spot\nwhere its predecessors have stood for ages. The son lives in the house\nof his father, cultivates the same few square feet of soil planted in\nedible roots, climbs the same cocoanut trees, follows the same winding\npath down to the stream, pounds rice in the same mortar and with the\nsame stick that his ancestors have used from time unremembered, and,\nin case of illness, curls up on a grass mat in a corner of the room\nuntil he dies or by some good fortune recovers. Beyond this narrow\nhorizon he never looks. So narrow and contracted is the life that the\nlanguages of two towns a few miles apart are so different that one\nwould scarcely recognize them as belonging to the same race of people.\n\nSuch are the two extremes of life in our new far Eastern provinces:\nthe one is active, progressive, and cosmopolitan; the other, inactive,\ndecadent, and narrow; but, whether one enjoys the first or endures the\nsecond, there comes to him after leaving a longing to lounge again in\ntropic airs and listen to the lullaby of the winds among the palms.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VII. - THE FILIPINO AT HOME.\n\n\nAs one enters a Filipino sitting-room for the first time, there is one\nfeature in the arrangement of the furniture that impresses itself upon\nhim at once, and it may be stated without fear of serious\ncontradiction that this same peculiar feature in its arrangement will\ncontinue to face him, as he enters different homes, about as certainly\nas he crosses the threshold.\n\nThe arrangement referred to is that of one large mirror, one settee,\nand some ten or a dozen chairs that appear to have had a certain\norderly affection for one another. The mirror is hung upon one of the\nlarge interior parts of the house about four feet above the floor. The\nwooden houses in the Philippines are built by setting large posts\nupright into the ground, extending into the air from twenty to thirty\nfeet. Cross timbers are fastened to these upright posts about eight or\nten feet above the ground and then not sawed off even with the posts,\nbut allowed to extend beyond them each way. The framework of the house\nis built upon these extending cross timbers, a style of building by\nwhich these large upright posts are left standing out on the inside of\nthe room from one to three feet from the walls. It is on that one of\nthese posts most nearly opposite the door that the mirror always finds\nits place. Immediately beneath the mirror is the settee; and the\nchairs are arranged in two parallel lines facing one another and at\nright angles with the ends of the settee. However odd this arrangement\nmay appear to one when he first enters a Filipino drawing-room, there\nare two things to be said in its favor. In the first place, it places\nyou face to face with the person with whom you are conversing so that\nyou can watch him,--a matter of no small moment in the Philippines. In\nthe next place, it enables you to give one of the young ladies a\nsheep's-eye in the mirror while the others present are left where\nMoses was in our much abused conundrum.\n\nThe size of the residence and the quality of its furnishings depends\nupon the wealth of the owner. But there is so vast a difference\nbetween the mode of life of the highest class and the tao, or lowest\nclass, that it is well to speak of them separately, and the great\nmiddle class of Filipinos can easily be imagined to occupy the\nintervening ground.\n\nThe rich Filipino's house is usually of wood built upon a wall of\nstone or brick from ten to fifteen feet high. The floors are kept\nhighly polished in his hallway, dressing-room, and bed-rooms. There\nare, of course, no fire-places in any of the rooms, but on some\noccasions something is needed to dry the rain-soaked atmosphere, for\neven in the dry season it has been seen to rain for five successive\ndays and nights without the cessation of a moment.\n\nA long chain of dependents is attached to the household of the rich\nFilipino. The master has his special body servant to be present at all\ntimes to do his master's bidding, in short, to be the visible\nmechanism of his master's volition. So, too, the lady of the house has\nher servant woman to do the slightest bidding of her ladyship. Then\nthere is the cook who is almost invariably a man, a house boy or two,\nand the coachman. These functionaries, with their assistants and\nassistants to the assistants, together with a servant or two for the\nexclusive service of the children, complete the economic household.\n\nSuch a family has an abundance of rice and wheat bread, also of\nchicken and fish with occasional fresh beef. They have also a good\ndeal of dulce. They regularly serve wine and frequently serve beer\non their tables.\n\nIn strong contrast with this mode of life is that of the tao. His\ndiet consists almost wholly of rice and small uncleaned fish boiled\ntogether. As a rule knife, fork, plate, and spoon find no place in his\nhousehold. The rice and fish are boiled in a pot and then allowed to\ncool in the same vessel or poured out to cool in a large earthen or\nwooden bowl. Then Mr. Tao together with Mrs. Tao and all the young\nTaos squat on their heels around the mixture and satisfy that\nintangible thing called the appetite. They do not use chop sticks as\nthe Chinese do, but the rice and fish are caught in a hollow formed by\nthe first three fingers of the right hand. The thumb is then placed\nbehind the mass. It is raised up and poised before the mouth, with a\nskill coming from the evolution of ages, when a contraction of the\nmuscles of the thumb throws the mass into the mouth with a skill that\nis marvelous to any but a Filipino. To judge from the most reliable\ninformation, the poorest class do not have an abundance of food,\nalthough it would seem that such a condition of things would be\nwell-nigh impossible. However, in a census of one hundred school\nchildren there were found six boys and four girls who declared that\nthey had never had enough to eat, and the native teacher stated that\nthis was probably true.\n\nThe wide gulf between the tao and the rich man is filled by the\ngreat middle class of Filipinos.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VIII. - VISIT TO A LEPER COLONY.\n\n\nNot far from our town was a leper colony and the first Saturday that\ncould be spared was set aside for a trip to the place. It happened\nthat none of the other Americans were at leisure on this particular\nmorning, but, rather then delay the trip or miss it altogether, the\nwriter, armed with a revolver, started out alone.\n\nThe road had been described so accurately by one who was supposed to\nknow it that it was deemed well-nigh impossible to miss the way. The\nmain highway was followed to the point where the by-path supposed to\nlead to the settlement turned off through some bamboo thickets and a\nlow tropical wood. This path led straight away towards the sea-coast\nwhere the houses of the colony were said to stand in a cocoanut grove\nby the beach.\n\nUpon arriving at the settlement, a very inhospitable reception was\nreceived from a mangy cur that growled and showed a very uninviting\nset of sharp, white teeth behind his snarling lips. The growling of\nthe dog had attracted the attention of an old man who, with age-bent\nback, was pounding rice in a mortar about fifty yards away. He turned\nslowly around and, upon seeing an intruder into the primitive quiet of\nthe place, gave a sharp, far-reaching call. The sound had scarcely\nrung through the grove when from about a dozen of the little grass\nhouses dotted here and there fifteen or twenty men armed with bolos\ncame out and gathered around the old man. A sense of my danger flashed\nupon me. Three miles from town and alone in a tropical jungle, I could\nbe almost instantly overcome by this band of bolo-men, and the only\nreport that would ever reach my people would be that I had\n\"disappeared.\" Of course, attack was by no means certain, but the\npotentiality of the situation was thrilling. A drawn revolver and the\ngleaming of its shining barrel had the effect of stopping the men, who\nseemed to be hesitating as to a course of action, until a somewhat\ndignified retreat was made to an open space in the rear from where a\nless dignified and a more hasty retreat began which did not stop short\nof Bacalod.\n\nEnough had been seen, however, even in this short visit, to give\nconvincing proof that the settlement visited was no colony of lepers;\nso, that afternoon two servant boys being taken as guides and\ninterpreters, another attempt was made to reach the goal desired.\n\nThis attempt was successful, and, after about two hours of walking, a\nlittle cluster of grass huts snugly hidden by the sea-coast came into\nview. As we approached, one would have thought it a gala-day. Some few\nchildren, apparently from six to thirteen years of age, almost wholly\nnude, were romping and playing in the open space around which the huts\nstood, and no one would ever have thought that any cloud so horrible\nas leprosy could hover over a place apparently so happy.\n\nBy the side of the path as we passed was a man and his wife setting\nout potato plants. His hands were so puffed and his fingers so short\nthat he could scarcely use them, but he was working along as best he\ncould. His wife's feet were so swollen and twisted that she walked\nonly with the greatest difficulty. We passed them by and entered the\nopen space above referred to.\n\nThe children now saw us, and those of them who could darted away like\nfrightened rabbits, each to his own burrow. An old man who was sitting\nin the warm afternoon sun on the little bamboo platform before his hut\nwas aroused from his lethargic repose by the scampering away of the\nchildren. He arose, trembling upon his tottering limbs, all drawn and\ntwisted, and hobbled away into his hut.\n\nThe children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at\nthe doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of\nthe settlement. In a few moments we were surrounded by a circle of\nhuman beings at once so repulsive and so pitiable that its graphic\nvividness can never be accurately portrayed.\n\nThe old man referred to above, having put on a pair of snow-white\npantaloons, appeared now at the doorway of his hut, followed a few\nmoments later by his wife who had evidently clothed herself in the\nbest raiment she had. At a call from the old man, all the men, women,\nand children in the settlement came out of their huts and stood in a\nline before us. The old man was spokesman and in his native visayan\ntongue made a heart-rending appeal for aid which we were powerless to\ngive. Attention was called to a leper woman, apparently about\ntwenty-five years of age, whose face had been attacked by the disease\nand whose appearance was truly pathetic. Upon her hip was a child\nabout a year and a half old and, strange to say, the child showed as\nyet no signs whatever of the disease.\n\nWhat an indissoluble enigma is life! Here in a little cluster of grass\nhuts in a secluded nook of a secluded island of an all but secluded\narchipelago was gathered together a little community of wretched\nnatives, driven by their loathsomeness from association with others\neven of the same half-savage race. Yet here, men and women loved and\nwere married, by mutual trust if not by law, and children were born of\nthe union to live forever under the unspeakable horror that\novershadowed the unfortunate parents. Love, hatred, sorrow, and\njoy--every passion that enters into the complex structure of the human\nheart even here, in this scene of sadness and despair, was playing\napparently as freely as where misfortune and disease had never crossed\nthe portals of life.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER IX. - A \"HIKE.\"\n\n\nWe were lounging lazily in our hammocks at Jimamaylan one evening in\nApril. Supper was just ended, and the soldiers in the post were\ncollected in groups here and there spinning yarns to pass away the\ntime, when a Filipino clad only in a loin cloth came down the street\nat a steadily swinging run and stopped in front of the sentry. He\nbrought the announcement that a band of ladrones had just burned a\nsugar mill and were advancing to sack a barrio about fifteen miles\naway.\n\nThe invitation of the commanding officer to go on a \"hike\" was eagerly\naccepted, and, in ten minutes after the message was given, the troops\nwere on the march followed by two adventurous pedagogues.\n\nDarkness was just closing in as we left the town, but a resplendent\ntropic moon soon made the night almost as brilliant as the day. The\ntrail we followed led over rough and rocky country. Sometimes for a\ndistance of a mile or more we passed over barren wastes of volcanic\nslag poured out in anger by some peak whose convulsions have long\nsince ceased. Again we would descend into a tropical jungle from the\ndense foliage of which the ladrones could have leaped at any moment,\nhad they known of our coming, and annihilated our little band. We\nforded rapid streams with the water at our breasts, and halted only\nonce in that rapid march of fifteen miles.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the town we met a man who was standing\nguard against a surprise by the ladrones. Nothing could well have been\nmuch more grotesque and nothing could much better illustrate the\nabsolutely primitive condition of the Filipinos in the interior of the\nislands than the appearance of this guard. A pair of knee pants, a\nconical grass hat, and a hemp shirt formed his entire apparel. A long\nflat wooden shield, a bolo, and a long bamboo spear with a sharp,\nflat, iron point, completed his equipment for battle.\n\nHere stood the first and the twentieth centuries side by side. The\nFilipino who had advanced only a stage beyond the condition of\nprimitive man with his knife, spear, and wooden shield, stood side by\nside with the American soldier, a representative of modern life with\nhis magazine rifle, his canteen, his knapsack,--with every article of\nhis clothing made to give him the highest possible efficiency as the\nunit of a military organization.\n\nA few yards farther on we met another guard equipped similarly to the\nfirst. Upon reaching the town, news had just been received that a\ndetachment of troops from another post had intercepted the ladrones\nand fought a skirmish with them. The ladrones had escaped and we set\nout in pursuit of them on a chase wilder than a Quixotic dream. We\nwound our way into the mountains behind the town, inquiring at every\ngrass hut we passed whether the band of ladrones had passed that way,\nbut only once was even a trace of them found. Then it was learned that\nat a certain place they had separated into groups of three or four and\ngone glimmering through the dream of things that were. This place was\nin a secluded nook of the mountains where in years gone by some\nadventurous Spaniard had erected a primitive water mill to grind his\nsugar-cane. We had now marched about twenty miles and the feet of the\npedagogues were a mass of blisters. They had reached the point where\nthat form of military maneuvering called \"hiking\" ceased to possess\nany alluring charms. So a native was persuaded to come out of his lone\nmountain hut and hitch up his carabao and cart. He was then made to\nget on the carabao's back, while the aforesaid pedagogues lay down on\nthe sugar-cane pulp that had been put into the body of the cart, and\nthe driver was instructed to start for the post we had left hours\nbefore, and not to stop until he got there. Being uncertain but that\nsome of the ladrones would learn of our having left the body of troops\nand would try the metal of our steel, we at first agreed that neither\nof us should go to sleep, but it was later decided that probably the\ndriver had no greater desire to cross the Styx than his passengers had\nand that in case of danger he would awaken us, so both took a revolver\nin each hand, stretched out supinely and went to sleep.\n\nSuch a sleep! The rough jolting of the cart over an almost impassable\nroad was never enough to break the spell of slumber. When we awoke the\nblazing tropic sun was past the midday mark of morning, shining full\ninto our unprotected and well-nigh blistered faces.\n\nA pack of dogs were heralding our approach to a little village at the\nfoot of the mountains where ponies were procured to take us back to\nthe post.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he insists, \"have stood the test of ages; and the plant\nevery where retained its name and credit: and one of our good\nherbarists, who had seen a wonderful case of a swoln spleen, so big, and\nhard as to be felt with terror, brought back to a state of nature by it\"\n\n(p. 37). The greatest portion of Hill's concluding section combines\nadvertisement for the powder medicine he was himself manufacturing at a\nhandsome profit together with a protest against competing apothecaries:\n\"An intelligent person was directed to go to the medicinal herb shops in\nthe several markets, and buy some of this Spleen-wort; the name was\nwritten, and shewn to every one; every shop received his money, and\nalmost every one sold a different plant, under the name of this: but\nwhat is very striking, not one of them the right\" (p. 42).\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis did not cease to be printed after Hill's in\n1766, but continued to issue from the presses into the nineteenth\ncentury. A good example of this is the tome by John Reid, physician to\nthe Finsbury Dispensary in London, Essays on Insanity, Hypochondriasis\nand Other Nervous Affections (1816), which summarizes theories of the\nmalady. A bibliographical study of such works would probably reveal\na larger number of titles in the nineteenth century than in the previous\none, but by this time the nature and definition of hypochondria had\nchanged significantly.\n\nIf John Hill's volume is not an important contribution in the history of\nmedicine, it is a lucid and brief exposition of many of the best ideas\nthat had been thought and written on the hyp, with the exception of his\nuninhibited prescribing of herbal medicines as cure-alls. An\nunderstanding of this disease is essential for readers of neoclassical\nEnglish literature, especially when we reflect upon the fact that some\nof the best literature of the period was composed by writers whom it\nafflicted. It is perhaps not without significance that the greatest poet\nof the Augustan age, Alexander Pope, thought it necessary as he lay on\nhis deathbed in May 1744 to exclaim with his last breath, \"I never was\nhippish in my whole life.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. I. - The NATURE of the DISORDER.\n\n\nTo call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and cruel. It\nis a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by thickened\nand distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver, and other\nparts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick scarce knows\none more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\n\nThe blood is a mixture of many fluids, which, in a state of health, are\nso combined, that the whole passes freely through its appointed vessels;\nbut if by the loss of the thinner parts, the rest becomes too gross to\nbe thus carried through, it will stop where the circulation has least\npower; and having thus stopped it will accumulate; heaping by degrees\nobstruction on obstruction.\n\nHealth and chearfulness, and the quiet exercise of mind, depend upon a\nperfect circulation: is it a wonder then, when this becomes impeded the\nbody looses of its health, and the temper of its sprightliness? to be\notherwise would be the miracle; and he inhumanly insults the afflicted,\nwho calls all this a voluntary frowardness. Its slightest state brings\nwith it sickness, anguish and oppression; and innumerable ills follow\nits advancing steps, unless prevented by timely care; till life itself\ngrows burthensome.\n\nThe disease was common in antient Greece; and her physicians understood\nit, better than those perhaps of later times, in any other country; who\nthough happy in many advantages these fathers of the science could not\nhave, yet want the great assistance of frequent watching it in all its\nstages.\n\nThose venerable writers have delivered its nature, and its cure: in the\nfirst every thing now shews they were right; and what they have said as\nto the latter will be found equally true and certain. This, so far as\npresent experience has confirmed it, and no farther, will be here laid\nbefore the afflicted in a few plain words.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. II. - Persons Subject to it.\n\n\nFatigue of mind, and great exertion of its powers often give birth to\nthis disease; and always tend to encrease it. The finer spirits are\nwasted by the labour of the brain: the Philosopher rises from his study\nmore exhausted than the Peasant leaves his drudgery; without the benefit\nthat he has from exercise. Greatness of mind, and steady virtue;\ndetermined resolution, and manly firmness, when put in action, and\nintent upon their object, all also lead to it: perhaps whatever tends to\nthe ennobling of the soul has equal share in bringing on this weakness\nof the body.\n\nFrom this we may learn easily who are the men most subject to it; the\ngrave and studious, those of a sedate temper and enlarged understanding,\nthe learned and wise, the virtuous and the valiant: those whom it were\nthe interest of the world to wish were free from this and every other\nillness; and who perhaps, except for this alloy, would have too large a\nportion of human happiness.\n\nThough these are most, it is not these alone, who are subject to it.\n\nThere are countries where it is endemial, and in other places some have\nthe seeds of it in their constitution; and in some it takes rise from\naccidents. In these last it is the easiest of cure; and in the first\nmost difficult.\n\nBeside the Greeks already named, the Jews of old time were heavily\nafflicted with this disease; and in their descendants to this day it is\noften constitutional: the Spaniards have it almost to a man; and so have\nthe American Indians. Perhaps the character of these several nations may\nbe connected with it. The steady honour, and firm valour of the\nSpaniard, very like that of the ancient Doric nation, who followed the\nflute not the trumpet to the field; and met the enemy, not with shouts\nand fury, but with a determined virtue: it is the temper of the\nHypochondriac to be slow, but unmoveably resolved: the Jew has shewn\nthis mistakenly, but almost miraculously; and the poor Indian, untaught\nas he is, faces all peril with composure, and sings his death-song with\nan unalter'd countenance.\n\nAmong particular persons the most inquiring and contemplative are those\nwho suffer oftenest by this disease; and of all degrees of men I think\nthe clergy. I do not mean the hunting, shooting, drinking clergy, who\nbear the tables of the great; but the retir'd and conscientious; such as\nattend in midnight silence to their duty; and seek in their own cool\nbreasts, or wheresoever else they may be found, new admonitions for an\nage plunged in new vices. To this disease we owe the irreparable loss of\nDr. YOUNG; and the present danger of many other the best and most\nimproved amongst us. May what is here to be proposed assist in their\npreservation!\n\nThe Geometrician or the learned Philosopher of whatever denomination,\nwhose course of study fixes his eye for ever on one object, his mind\nintensely and continually employed upon one thought, should be warned\nalso that he is in danger; or if he find himself already afflicted, he\nshould be told that the same course of life, which brought it on, will,\nwithout due care, encrease it to the most dreaded violence.\n\nThe middle period of life is that in which there is the greatest danger\nof an attack from this disease; and the latter end of autumn, when the\nsummer heats have a little time been over, is the season when in our\nclimate its first assaults are most to be expected. The same time of the\nyear always increases the disorder in those who have been before\nafflicted with it; and it is a truth must be confessed, that from its\nfirst attack the patient grows continually, though slowly, worse; unless\na careful regimen prevent it.\n\nThe constitutions most liable to this obstruction are the lean, and dark\ncomplexioned; the grave and sedentary. Let such watch the first\nsymptoms; and obviate, (as they may with ease) that which it will be\nmuch more difficult to remove.\n\nIt is happy a disease, wherein the patient must do a great deal for\nhimself, falls, for the most part, upon those who have the powers of\nreason strongest. Let them only be aware of this, that the distemper\nnaturally disposes them to inactivity; and reason will have no use\nunless accompanied with resolution to enforce it.\n\nThough the physician can do something toward the cure, much more depends\nupon the patient; and here his constancy of mind will be employed most\nhappily. No one is better qualified to judge on a fair hearing what\ncourse is the most fit; and having made that choice, he must with\npatience wait its good effects. Diseases that come on slowly must have\ntime for curing; an attention to the first appearances of the disorder\nwill be always happiest; because when least established it is easiest\noverthrown: but when that happy period has been neglected, he must wait\nthe effects of such a course as will dilute and melt the obstructing\nmatter gradually; for till that be done it is not only vain, but\nsometimes dangerous, to attempt its expulsion from the body.\n\nThe blood easily separates itself into the grosser and the thinner\nparts: we see this in bleeding; and from the toughness of the red cake\nmay guess how very difficult it will be to dissolve a substance of like\nfirmness in the vessels of the body. That it can thus become thickened\nwithin the body, a Pleurisy shews us too evidently: in that case it is\nbrought on suddenly, and with inflammation; in this other, slowly and\nwithout; and here, even before it forms the obstruction, can bring on\nmany mischiefs. Various causes can produce the same effect, but that in\nall cases operates most durably, which operates most slowly. The watery\npart of the blood is its mild part; in the remaining gross matter of it,\nare acrid salts and burning oils, and these, when destitute of that\nhappy dilution nature gives them in a healthy body, are capable of doing\ngreat mischief to the tender vessels in which they are kept stagnant.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. III. - The SYMPTOMS of the DISORDER.\n\n\nThe first and lightest of the signs that shew this illness are a lowness\nof spirits, and inaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love\nof solitude and a habit of thinking, even on trifling subjects, with too\nmuch steadiness. A very little help may combat these: but if that\nindolence which is indeed a part of the disorder, will neglect them;\nworse must be expected soon to follow.\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness, weight, and oppression in the body,\na want of appetite, or, what is worse, an appetite without digestion;\nfor these are the conditions of different states of the disease, a\nfullness and a difficulty of breathing after meals, a straitness of the\nbreast, pains and flatulencies in the bowels, and an unaptness to\ndischarge their contents.\n\nThe pulse becomes low, weak, and unequal; and there are frequent\npalpitations of the heart, a little dark-coloured urine is voided at\nsome times; and a flood of colourless and insipid at others; relieving\nfor a moment, but increasing the distemper: there is in some cases also\na continual teazing cough, with a choaking stoppage in the throat at\ntimes; then heartburn, sickness, hardness of the belly, and a costive\nhabit, or a tormenting and vain irritation.\n\nThe lips turn pale, the eyes loose their brightness and by degrees the\nwhite grows as it were greenish, the gums want their due firmness, with\ntheir proper colour; and an unpleasing foulness grows upon the teeth:\nthe inside of the mouth is pale and furred, and the throat dry and\nhusky: the colour of the skin is pale (though there are periods when the\nface is florid) and as the obstruction gathers ground, and more affects\nthe liver, the whole body becomes yellow, tawny, greenish, and at length\nof that deep and dusky hue, to which men of swift imagination have given\nthe name of blackness.\n\nThese symptoms do not all appear in any one period of the disease, or in\none case, but at one time or other all of them, as well as those which\nfollow: the flesh becomes cold to the touch, though the patient does not\nhimself perceive it; the limbs grow numbed and torpid, the breathing\ndull and slow, and the voice hollow; and usually the appetite in this\nperiod declines, and comes almost to nothing: night sweats come on,\nblack swellings appear on the veins, the flesh wastes and the breast\nbecomes flat and hollow: the mouth is full of a thin spittle, the head\nis dizzy and confus'd, and sometimes there is an unconquerable numbness\nin the organs of speech.\n\nI have known the temporary silence that follows upon this last symptom\nbecome a jest to the common herd; and the unhappy patient, instead of\ncompassion and assistance, receive the reproof of sullenness, from those\nwho should have known and acted better.\n\nAbout twenty years ago I met on a visit at Catthorpe in Leicestershire a\nyoung gentleman of distinguished learning and abilities, who at certain\ntimes was speechless. The vulgar thought it a pretence: and a jocose\nlady, where he was at tea with company, putting him as she said to a\ntrial, poured out a dish very strong and without sugar. He drank it and\nreturned the cup with a bow of great reserve, and his eye bent on the\nground: she then filled the cup with sugar, and pouring weak tea on it,\nsent it him: he drank that too, looked at her steadily, and blushed for\nher. The lady declared the man was dumb; the rest thought him perverse,\nand obstinate; but a constant and steady perseverance in an easy method\ncured him.\n\nAll these are miseries which the disease, while it retains its natural\nform, can bring upon the patient; and thus he will in time be worn out,\nand led miserably, though slowly, to the grave. Let him not indulge his\ninactivity so far as to give way to this, because it is represented as\nfar off; the disease may suddenly and frightfully change its nature; and\nswifter evils follow.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. IV. - The DANGER.\n\n\nWe have done with the obstruction considered in itself; but this, though\noften unsurmountable by art, at least by the methods now in use, will be\nsometimes broken through at once by nature, or by accidents; and bring\non fatal evils. These are strictly different diseases, and are no\notherway concerned here, than as the consequences of that of which we\nare treating.\n\nThe thick and glutinous blood which has so long stagnated in the spleen,\nwill have in that time altered its nature, and acquired a very great\ndegree of acrimony: while it lies dormant, this does no more mischiefs,\nthan those named already; but when violent exercise, a fit of outrageous\nanger, or any thing else that suddenly shocks and disturbs the frame,\nputs it in motion, it melts at once into a kind of liquid putrefaction.\n\nBeing now thin, it mixes itself readily with the blood again, and brings\non putrid fevers; destroys the substance of the spleen itself, or being\nthrown upon some other of the viscera, corrodes them, and leads on this\nway a swift and miserable death. If it fall upon the liver, its tender\npulpy substance is soon destroyed, jaundices beyond the help of art\nfirst follow, then dropsies and all their train of misery; if on lungs,\nconsumptions; if on the brain, convulsions, epilepsy, palsy, apoplexy;\nif on the surface, leprosy.\n\nThe intention of cure is to melt this coagulation softly, not to break\nit violently; and then to give it a very gentle passage through the\nbowels. There is no safe way for it to take but that; and even that when\nurged too far may bring on fatal dysenteries.\n\nLet none wonder at the sudden devastation which sometimes arises from\nthis long stagnant matter, when liquified too hastily: how long, how\nmany years the impacted matter will continue quiet in a schirrous tumour\nof the breast; but being once put in motion, whether from accident, or\nin the course of nature, what can describe; or what can stop its\nhavock!\n\nInstances of the other are too frequent. A nobleman the other day died\nparalytick: dissection shewed a spleen consumed by an abscess, formed\nfrom the dissolved matter of such an obstruction: and 'tis scarce longer\nsince, a learned gentleman, who had been several years lost to his\nfriends, by the extreams of a Hypochondriacal disorder, seem'd gradually\nwithout assistance to recover: but the lungs suffered while the spleen\nwas freed; and he died very soon of what is called a galloping\nconsumption.\n\nWhen the obstruction is great and of long continuance, if it be thus\nhastily moved, the consequence is, equally, a sudden and a miserable\ndeath, whether, like the matter of a cancer, it remains in its place; or\nlike that of a bad small pox, be thrown upon some other vital part.\n\nLet not the patient be too much alarmed; this is laid down to caution,\nnot to terrify him: it is fit he should know his danger, and attend to\nit; for the prevention is easy; and the cure, even of the most advanced\nstages, when undertaken by gentle means, is not at all impracticable: to\nassist the physician, let him look into himself, and recollect the\nsource of his complaint. This he may judge of from the following\nnotices.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. V. - The Causes of the HYPOCHONDRIASIS.\n\n\nThe obstruction which forms this disease, may take its origin from\ndifferent accidents: a fever ill cured has often caused it; or the\npiles, which had been used to discharge largely, ceasing; a marshy soil,\npoisoned with stagnant water, has given it to some persons; and altho'\nindolence and inactivity are oftenest at the root, yet it has arisen\nfrom too great exercise.\n\nReal grief has often brought it on; and even love, for sometimes that is\nreal. Study and fixed attention of the mind have been accused before;\nand add to these the stooping posture of the body, which most men use,\nthough none should use it, in writing and in reading. This has\ncontributed too much to it; but of all other things night studies are\nthe most destructive. The steady stillness, and dusky habit of all\nnature in those hours, enforce, encourage, and support that settled\ngloom, which rises from fixt thought; and sinks the body to the grave;\neven while it carries up the mind to heaven. He who would have his lamp\n        At midnight hour\n  Be seen in some high lonely tower,\nwill waste the flame of this unheeded life: and while he labours to\nunsphere the spirit of Plato will let loose his own.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VI. - The Cure of the HYPOCHONDRIASIS.\n\n\nLet him who would escape the mischiefs of an obstructed spleen, avoid\nthe things here named: and let him who suffers from the malady,\nendeavour to remember to which of them it has been owing; for half the\nhope depends upon that knowledge.\n\nNature has sometimes made a cure herself, and we should watch her ways;\nfor art never is so right as when it imitates her: sometimes the\npatient's own resolution has set him free. This is always in his power,\nand at all times will do wonders.\n\nThe bleeding of the piles, from nature's single efforts, has at once\ncured a miserable man; where their cessation was the cause of the\ndisorder. A leprosy has appeared upon the skin, and all the symptoms of\nthe former sickness vanished. This among the Jews happened often: both\ndiseases we know were common among them: and I have here seen something\nvery like it: Water-Dock has thrown out scorbutic eruptions, and all the\nformer symptoms of an Hypochondriacal disorder have disappeared:\nreturning indeed when these were unadvisedly struck in; but keeping off\nentirely when they were better treated. A natural purging unsuppressed\nhas sometimes done the same good office: but this is hazardous.\n\nIt is easy to be directed from such instances; only let us take the\nwhole along with us. Bleeding would have answered nature's purpose, if\nshe could not have opened of herself the h\u00e6morrhoidal vessels; but he\nwho should give medicines for that purpose, might destroy his patient by\ntoo great disturbance. If a natural looseness may perform the cure, so\nmay an artificial; when the original source of the disorder points that\nway. But these are helps that take place only in particular cases.\n\nThe general and universal method of cure must be by some mild and gently\nresolving medicine, under the influence of which the obstructing matter\nmay be voided that, or some other way with safety. The best season to\nundertake this is the autumn, but even here there must be caution.\n\nIn the first place, no strong evacuating remedy must be given; for that,\nby carrying off the thinner parts of the juices, will tend to thicken\nthe remainder; and certainly encrease the distemper. No acrid medicine\nmust be directed, for that may act too hastily, dissolve the impacted\nmatter at once, and let it loose, to the destruction of the sufferer; no\nantimonial, no mercurial, no martial preparation must be taken; in\nshort, no chymistry: nature is the shop that heaven has set before us,\nand we must seek our medicine there. The venerable ancients, who knew\nnot this new art, will lead us in the search; and (faithful relators as\nthey are of truth) will tell us whence we may deduce our hope; and what\nwe are to fear.\n\nBut prior to the course of any medicine, and as an essential to any good\nhope from it, the patient must prescribe himself a proper course of\nlife, and a well chosen diet: let us assist him in his choice; and speak\nof this first, as it comes first in order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VI. - Rules of Life for Hypochondriac Persons.\n\n\nAir and exercise, as they are the best preservers of health, and\ngreatest assistants in the cure of all long continued diseases, will\nhave their full effect in this; but there requires some caution in the\nchoice, and management of them. It is common to think the air of high\ngrounds best; but experience near home shews otherwise: the\nHypochondriac patient is always worse at Highgate even than in London.\n\nThe air he breathes should be temperate; not exposed to the utmost\nviolences of heat and cold, and the swift changes from one to the\nother; which are most felt on those high grounds. The side of a hill is\nthe best place for him: and though wet grounds are hurtful; yet let\nthere be the shade of trees, to tempt him often to a walk; and soften by\ntheir exhalation the over dryness of the air.\n\nThe exercise he takes should be frequent; but not violent. Motion\npreserves the firmness of the parts, and elasticity of the vessels; it\nprevents that aggregation of thick humours which he is most to fear. A\nsedentary life always produces weakness, and that mischief always\nfollows: weak eyes are gummy, weak lungs are clogged with phlegm, and\nweak bowels waste themselves in vapid diarrhoeas.\n\nLet him invite himself abroad, and let his friends invite him by every\ninnocent inducement. For me, I should advise above all other things the\nstudy of nature. Let him begin with plants: he will here find a\ncontinual pleasure, and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful\nthings; even of the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to\nwalk; and every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket,\nwill afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually\nin the air, and continually to change the nature and quality of the air,\nby visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the lawn, the\nheath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be abroad; and the\nunceasing variety of the subjects of his observation, will prevent his\nwalking hastily: he will pursue his studies in the air; and that\ncontemplative turn of mind, which in his closet threatened his\ndestruction, will thus become the great means of his recovery.\n\nIf the mind tire upon this, from the repeated use, another of nature's\nkingdoms opens itself at once upon him; the plant he is weary of\nobserving, feeds some insect he may examine; nor is there a stone that\nlies before his foot, but may afford instruction and amusement.\n\nEven what the vulgar call the most abject things will shew a wonderful\nutility; and lead the mind, in pious contemplation higher than the\nstars. The poorest moss that is trampled under foot, has its important\nuses: is it at the bottom of a wood we find it? why there it shelters\nthe fallen seeds; hides them from birds, and covers them from frost;\nand thus becomes the foster father of another forest! creeps it along\nthe surface of a rock? even there its good is infinite! its small roots\nrun into the stone, and the rains make their way after them; the moss\nhaving lived its time dies; it rots and with the mouldered fragments of\nthe stone forms earth; wherein, after a few successions, useful plants\nmay grow, and feed more useful cattle!\n\nIs there a weed more humble in its aspect, more trampled on, or more\ndespised than knot grass! no art can get the better of its growth, no\nlabour can destroy it; 'twere pity if they could, for the thing lives\nwhere nothing would of use to us; and its large and most wonderfully\nabundant seeds, feed in hard winters, half the birds of Heaven.\n\nWhat the weak moss performs upon the rock the loathed toadstool brings\nabout in timber: is an oak dead where man's eye will not find it? this\nfungus roots itself upon the bark, and rots the wood beneath it; hither\nthe beetle creeps for shelter, and for sustenance; him the woodpecker\nfollows as his prey; and while he tears the tree in search of him, he\nscatters it about the ground; which it manures.\n\nNor is it the beetle alone that thus insinuates itself into the\nsubstance of the vegetable tribe: the tender aphide, whom a touch\ndestroys, burrows between the two skins of a leaf, for shelter from his\nwinged enemies; tracing, with more than Dedal\u00e6an art, his various\nmeanders; and veining the green surface with these white lines more\nbeautifully than the best \u00c6gyptian marble.\n\n'Twere endless to proceed; nor is it needful: one object will not fail\nto lead on to another, and every where the goodness of his God will\nshine before him even in what are thought the vilest things; his\ngreatness in the lead of them.\n\nLet him pursue these thoughts, and seek abroad the objects and the\ninstigations to them: but let him in these and all other excursions\navoid equally the dews of early morning, and of evening.\n\nThe more than usual exercise of this prescription will dispose him to\nmore than customary sleep, let him indulge it freely; so far from\nhurting, it will help his cure.\n\nLet him avoid all excesses: drink need scarce be named, for we are\nwriting to men of better and of nobler minds, than can be tempted to\nthat humiliating vice. Those who in this disorder have too great an\nappetite, must not indulge it; much eaten was never well digested: but\nof all excesses the most fatal in this case is that of venery. It is the\nexcess we speak of.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VII. - The proper DIET.\n\n\nIn the first place acids must be avoided carefully; and all things that\nare in a state of fermentation, for they will breed acidity. Provisions\nhardened by salting never should be tasted; much less those cured by\nsmoaking, and by salting. Bacon is indigestible in an Hypochondriac\nstomach; and hams, impregnated as is now the custom, with acid fumes\nfrom the wood fires over which they are hung, have that additional\nmischief.\n\nMilk ought to be a great article in the diet: and even in this there\nshould be choice. The milk of grass-fed cows has its true quality: no\nother. There are a multitude of ways in which this may be made a part\nboth of our foods and drinks, and they should all be used.\n\nThe great and general caution is that the diet be at all times of a kind\nloosening and gently stimulating; light but not acrid. Veal, lamb,\nfowls, lobsters, crabs, craw-fish, fresh water fish and mutton broth,\nwith plenty of boiled vegetables, are always right; and give enough\nvariety.\n\nRaw vegetables are all bad: sour wines, old cheese, and bottled beer are\nthings never to be once tasted. Indeed much wine is wrong, be it of what\nkind soever. It is the first of cordials; and as such I would have it\ntaken in this disease when it is wanted: plainly as a medicine, rather\nthan a part of diet. Malt liquor carefully chosen is certainly the best\ndrink. This must be neither new, nor tending to sourness; perfectly\nclear, and of a moderate strength: it is the native liquor of our\ncountry, and the most healthful.\n\nToo much tea weakens; and even sugar is in this disorder hurtful: but\nhoney may supply its place in most things; and this is not only harmless\nbut medicinal; a very powerful dissolvent of impacted humours, and a\ngreat deobstruent.\n\nWhat wine is drank should be of some of the sweet kinds. Old Hock has\nbeen found on enquiry to yield more than ten times the acid of the sweet\nwines; and in red Port, at least in what we are content to call so,\nthere is an astringent quality, that is most mischievous in these cases:\nit is said there is often alum in it: how pregnant with mischief that\nmust be to persons whose bowels require to be kept open, is most\nevident. Summer fruits perfectly ripe are not only harmless but\nmedicinal; but if eaten unripe they will be very prejudicial. A light\nsupper, which will leave an appetite for a milk breakfast, is always\nright; this will not let the stomach be ravenous for dinner, as it is\napt to be in those who make that their only meal.\n\nOne caution more must be given, and it may seem a strange one: it is\nthat the patient attend regularly to his hours of eating. We have to do\nwith men for the most part whose soul is the great object of their\nregard; but let them not forget they have a body.\n\nThe late Dr. STUKELY has told me, that one day by appointment visiting\nSir ISAAC NEWTON, the servant told him, he was in his study. No one was\npermitted to disturb him there; but as it was near dinner time, the\nvisitor sat down to wait for him. After a time dinner was brought in; a\nboil'd chicken under a cover. An hour pass'd, and Sir ISAAC did not\nappear. The doctor eat the fowl, and covering up the empty dish, bad\nthem dress their master another. Before that was ready, the great man\ncame down; he apologiz'd for his delay, and added, \"give me but leave to\ntake my short dinner, and I shall be at your service; I am fatigued and\nfaint.\" Saying this, he lifted up the cover; and without any emotion,\nturned about to STUKELY with a smile; \"See says he, what we studious\npeople are, I forgot I had din'd.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VIII. - The MEDICINE.\n\n\n'Tis the ill fate of this disease, more than of all others to be\nmisunderstood at first, and thence neglected; till the physician shakes\nhis head at a few first questions. None steals so fatally upon the\nsufferer: its advances are by very slow degrees; but every day it grows\nmore difficult of cure.\n\nThat this obstruction in the spleen is the true malady, the cases\nrelated by the antients, present observation, and the unerring\ntestimonies of dissections leave no room to doubt. Being understood, the\npath is open where to seek a remedy: and our best guides in this, as in\nthe former instance, will be those venerable Greeks; who saw a thousand\nof these cases, where we see one; and with less than half our theory,\ncured twice as many patients.\n\nOne established doctrine holds place in all these writers; that whatever\nby a hasty fermentation dissolves the impacted matter of the\nobstruction, and sends it in that state into the blood, does incredible\nmischief: but that whatever medicine softens it by slow degrees, and, as\nit melts, delivers it to the bowels without disturbance; will cure with\nequal certainty and safety.\n\nFor this good purpose, they knew and tried a multitude of herbs; but in\nthe end they fixed on one: and on their repeated trials of this, they\nbanished all the rest. This stood alone for the cure of the disease; and\nfrom its virtue received the name of SPLEEN-WORT. O wise and happy\nGreeks! authors of knowledge and perpetuators of it! With them the very\nname they gave a plant declared its virtues: with us, a writer calls a\nplant from some friend; that the good gardener who receives the honour,\nmay call another by his name who gave it. We now add the term smooth\nto this herb, to distinguish it from another, called by the same general\nterm, though not much resembling it.\n\nThe virtues of this smooth Spleen-wort have flood the test of ages; and\nthe plant every where retained its name and credit: and one of our good\nherbalists, who had seen a wonderful case of a swoln spleen, so big, and\nhard as to be felt with terror, brought back to a state of nature by it;\nand all the miserable symptoms vanish; thought Spleen-wort not enough\nexpressive of its excellence; but stamp'd on it the name of MILT-WASTE.\n\nIn the Greek Islands now, the use of it is known to every one; and even\nthe lazy monks who take it, are no longer splenetic. In the west of\nEngland, the rocks are stripped of it with diligence; and every old woman\ntells you how charming that leaf is for bookish men: in Russia they use\na plant of this kind in their malt liquor: it came into fashion there\nfor the cure of this disease; which from its constant use is scarce\nknown any longer; and they suppose 'tis added to their liquor for a\nflavour.\n\nThe ancients held it in a kind of veneration; and used what has been\ncalled a superstition in the gathering it. It was to be taken up with a\nsharp knife, without violence, and laid upon the clean linen: no time\nbut the still darkness of the night was proper, and even the moon was\nnot to shine upon it. I know they have been ridiculed for this; for\nnothing is so vain as learned ignorance: but let me be permitted once to\nvindicate them.\n\nThe plant has leaves that can close in their sides; and their under part\nis covered thick with a yellow powder, consisting of the seeds, and seed\nvessels: in these they knew the virtue most resided: this was the golden\ndust they held so valuable; and this they knew they could not be too\ncautious to preserve. They were not ignorant of the sleep of plants; a\nmatter lately spoken of by some, as if a new discovery; and being\nsensible that light, a dry air, an expanded leaf, and a tempestuous\nseason, were the means of losing this fine dust; and knowing also that\ndarkness alone brought on that closing of the leaf which thence has\nbeen called sleep; and which helped to defend and to secure it, they\ntherefore took such time, and used such means as could best preserve the\nplant entire; and even save what might be scattered from it.--And now\nwhere is their superstition?\n\nFrom this plant thus collected they prepared a medicine, which in a\ncourse of forty days scarce ever failed to make a perfect cure.\n\nWe have the plant wild with us; and till the fashion of rough chemical\npreparations took off our attention from these gentler remedies, it was\nin frequent use and great repute. I trust it will be so again: and many\nthank me for restoring it to notice.\n\nSpleen-wort gives out its virtues freely in a tincture; and a small dose\nof this, mixing readily with the blood and juices, gradually dissolves\nthe obstruction; and by a little at a time delivers its contents to be\nthrown off without pain, from the bowels. Let this be done while the\nviscera are yet sound and the cure is perfect. More than the forty days\nof the Greek method is scarce ever required; much oftener two thirds of\nthat time suffice; and every day, from the first dose of it, the patient\nfeels the happy change that is growing in his constitution. His food no\nmore turns putrid on his stomach, but yields its healthful nourishment.\n\nThe swelling after meals therefore vanishes; and with that goes the\nlowness, and anxiety, the difficult breath, and the distracting cholick:\nhe can bear the approach of rainy weather without pain; he finds himself\nmore apt for motion, and ready to take that exercise which is to be\nassistant in his cure; life seems no longer burthensome. His bowels get\ninto the natural condition of health, and perform their office once at\nleast a day; better if a little more: the dull and dead colour of his\nskin goes off, his lips grow red again, and every sign of health\nreturns.\n\nLet him who takes the medicine, say whether any thing here be\nexaggerated. Let him, if he pleases to give himself the trouble, talk\nover with me, or write to me, this gradual decrease of his complaints,\nas he proceeds in his cure. My uncertain state of health does not\npermit me to practise physic in the usual way, but I am very desirous to\ndo what good I can, and shall never refuse my advice, such as it may be,\nto any person rich or poor, in whatever manner he may apply for it. I\nshall refer him to no apothecary, whose bills require he should be\ndrenched with potions; but tell him, in this as in all other cases,\nwhere to find some simple herb; which he may if he please prepare\nhimself; or if he had rather spare that trouble, may have it so prepared\nfrom me.\n\nWith regard to Spleen-wort, no method of using it is more effectual than\nsimply taking it in powder; the only advantage of a tincture, is that a\nproper dose may be given, and yet the stomach not be loaded with so\nlarge a quantity: it is an easier and pleasanter method, and nothing\nmore.\n\nIf any person choose to take it in the other way, I should still wish\nhim once at least to apply to me; that he may be assured what he is\nabout to take is the right plant. Abuses in medicines are at this time\nvery great, and in no instance worse than what relates to herbs. The\nbest of our physicians have complained upon this head with warmth, but\nwithout redress: they know the virtues and the value of many of our\nnative plants, but dread to prescribe them; lest some wrong thing should\nbe administered in their place; perhaps inefficacious, perhaps\nmischievous, nay it may be fatal. The few simple things I direct are\nalways before me; and it will at all times be a pleasure to me, in this\nand any other instance, to see whether what any person is about to take\nbe right. I have great obligations to the public, and this is the best\nreturn that I know how to make.\n\nTo see the need of such a caution, hear a transaction but of yesterday!\n\nAn intelligent person was directed to go to the medicinal herb shops in\nthe several markets, and buy some of this Spleen-wort; the name was\nwritten, and shewn to every one; every shop received his money, and\nalmost every one sold a different plant, under the name of this: but\nwhat is very striking, not one of them the right. Such is the chance of\nhealth in those hands through which the best means of it usually pass;\neven in the most regular course of application.\n\nI would not be understood to limit the little services I may this way be\nable to render the afflicted, to this single instance; much less to\npropose to myself any advantages from it. Whoever pleases will be\nwelcome to me, upon any such occasion; and whatever be the herb on which\nhe places a dependance, he shall be shewn it growing. I once recommended\na garden to be established for this use, at the public expence: one\ngreat person has put it in my power to answer all its purposes.\n\n                        F  I  N  I  S.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris, he was\n\"nominated\" to the Academy. He had but to present an Historical\nPainting in order to take his seat as an Academician.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VENUS AND MARRIAGE\n\n\nBack in his beloved Paris again; thrilled by the atmosphere and gaiety\nof its merry life; in the full vigour of manhood on the eve of his\nthirties; amongst congenial friends; done with the drudgery of winning\nto Academic honour, Boucher saw that the public were not falling over\neach other to purchase religious or historic pictures; he straightway\nturned his back upon these things, and on the edge of his thirtieth\nyear he gave to the world his \"Marriage of the Children of God with\nthe Children of Men,\" in which Venus is the avowed mistress of his\nadoration. It caused a fine stir, and greatly increased his repute.\n\nIn this picture he ends his Italian period and strikes his own\npersonal note. Both this and the \"Venus asking arms for Aeneas from\nVulcan,\" together with the \"Birth of Adonis\" and the \"Death of\nAdonis,\" of about the same period, still show Boucher strongly under\nthe influence of his master, Lemoyne. Indeed, the \"Birth\" and \"Death\nof Adonis,\" their record lost during the scuffle and confusion of the\nRevolution, for long hung side by side as pictures by Lemoyne, until,\nbeing cleaned about 1860, Boucher's initials were discovered upon\nthem, and, contemporary engravings being hunted up, still further\nproved their origin. But in the Venus that now figures in all his\nworks there is that flesh-painting of the nude, and that rosy touch\nupon the flesh of the female figure, that are a far more certain\nsignature of Boucher's handiwork than any written name.\n\nUnfortunately the Salons were closed during Boucher's earlier years\nuntil he was thirty-four, and the record of his work during these\nyears is difficult to follow; but with his service to Venus his\npersonal career begins, and the stream of his Venus-pieces steadily\nflows from his hands.\n\nHe came to her service rid of all prentice essays in craftsmanship, a\nfinished and consummate artist. He found in his subject a goddess to\nwhom he could devote his great and splendid gifts. He painted her\ndainty body with a radiant delight and a rare colour-sense such as\nFrance had never before seen or uttered. He remains to this day the\nfirst painter of the subtle, delicate, and elusive thing that is\nfemininity; he caught her allure, her charm, as he was to catch the\nfragrance and charm of children and flowers; and he set the statement\nof these things upon canvas as they have never been uttered.\n\nThe whole of his life long, Boucher gave himself up with equal and\npassionate devotion to work and to pleasure--working at his easel\noften twelve hours of his day without losing, to the end when the\nbrush fell from his dead fingers, his blitheness of heart or his\ngenerosity of act, and without weakening the pleasure-loving desires\nof his gadding spirit. Out of his splendid toil he made the means to\nindulge his tastes for pleasure; and the gratifying of his tastes in\nturn renewed and created the ideas that made the subjects of his\nartistry. He brought to all he did a joy in the doing that made of his\nvast labour one long pleasure--of his pleasures a riot of industry. He\nplayed as he toiled, scarce knowing which was play and which toil.\n\nThe gossip of his love-affairs makes no romantic story--they were but\ncommonplace ecstasies with unknown frail women. But hard as he worked\nand lived and played, he found time to get himself married in his\nthirtieth year to pretty seventeen-year-old Marie Jeanne Buseau, a\nlittle Parisian--and for love of her, so far as he understood the\nbusiness; for she brought him no dowry.\n\nThe young couple settled down for the next ten years in the Rue\nSaint-Thomas-du-Louvre. Here Boucher lived through his thirties.\n\nMadame was a pretty creature, if we had but Latour's pastel portrait\nalone to prove it. But the pretty features were the crown to as pretty\na body, for she sat often to her lord; and it is clear from his\ncorrespondence with a friend, Bachaumont, that she is the Psyche of\nhis illustrated fable--and Psyche runs much to the Altogether.\n\nMarriage, however, was not likely to imprison Boucher's gadding eyes;\nand it did not. Madame Boucher seems to have had as frail a heart, and\navoided strife by amusing herself, amongst others, with the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who, to gain access to the lady,\ncommissioned Boucher to do the Watteau-like illustrations to\nAcajou--a dull affair. Boucher's pretty wife, herself no mean\nartist, worked in his studio, and painted several smaller canvases\nafter his pictures, gaining some fame as a miniaturist and engraver.\n\nNor did Marriage turn Boucher from his art. Two years were gone by\nsince his nomination to the Academy; he had now to paint the formal\nHistorical Picture and present it in order to take his seat as\nAcademician; and it was in this his thirtieth year that he painted and\nwon his academic rank with the \"Renauld et Armide\" now at the Louvre.\n\nHere he sufficiently subordinated his own style to the academic to\nensure success; and the work was hailed by Academicians and critics,\nincluding Diderot, with enthusiasm. But even here we have his cupids\npeeping round the mythologic event; and Armide herself has pretty\nFrench lips that knew no Greek.\n\nOnce secure of his position, he straightway flung the last remnants of\nthe academic style out of his studio door; and it is a grim comment on\ncriticism that it was just exactly in proportion as he developed his\nown personal genius and uttered the France of his day, that he was\nattacked; whilst the stilted things that he knew were third-rate, and\nwhich he wholly rejected from henceforth, were exactly the things that\nwere praised!\n\nHis election to the Academy, and the enthusiasm over the picture that\nwon him his seat thereat, brought his name before the young king; the\nfollowing year he received his first order from the Court whose\npainter he was destined to become. The decorations in the queen's\napartments were gloomy and had grown black; and he painted in their\nstead the \"Charity,\" \"Abundance,\" \"Fidelity,\" and \"Prudence\" still\nthere to be seen. Indeed, with his gay vision, his pretty habit of\nculling only the flowers from the garden of life, and his quickness to\nset down the pleasing thing in every prospect, Boucher was the\ndestined painter of a Court weary of pomposity and the pose of the\nmock-heroic, and which was wholly giving itself up to pleasure and the\nelegances.\n\nBut neither his new dignity of Academician nor the royal favour, kept\nhim from the bookshops; and he illustrated, with rare beauty and a\ncharm worthy of Watteau, the great edition of the Works of Moli\u00e8re\nin his thirty-first year. It is true that he made as free with\nMoli\u00e8re's world as with the Gods of Olympus; he peoples the plays with\ncharacters of his own day, arrayed in the dress and habit of that day,\nand moving in surroundings that he saw about him.\n\n\nLE MONDE QUI S'AMUSE\n\n\nThe Homely had come upon the town out of Holland, painted with most\nconsummate artistry by Chardin, and was soon in the vogue. Boucher had\na quick eye for the mode. And he straightway set himself to the\npainting of \"La Belle Cuisini\u00e8re.\" Still-life and homely subjects need\nan accuracy of realism and a Dutch sense of these things, a sense of\nsincerity and an appreciation of the dignity of the work-a-day life of\nthe people, in which Boucher was wholly lacking. Above all, it calls\nfor a sense of \"character,\" which, in Boucher, was always weak. It was\na sneer against him that his very broomsticks called for pompons and\nribbons--and there was more than a little truth in the spite. He is\nmore concerned with the accident of the kissing of a kitchen-maid than\nwith the kitchen's habit. He cannot even peep into a scullery without\ndragging in Venus by the skirts, and tricking her out in a\nproperty-wardrobe of a scullery-wench, in which the girl is clearly\nbut acting the part.\n\nHowever, these passing vogues and experiments in different methods\nwere only gay asides--he was working the while upon his own subjects;\nand, to the display by its several members ordered by the Academy, he\nsent four little paintings of fauns and cupids which won him the\nhonour of election as deputy-professor. His brain and hand were very\nbusy, and he turns from one thing to another with amazing facility,\nbringing distinction to all that he does.\n\nBut he painted about this time two pictures of infants, \"L'Amour\nOiseleur\" and \"L'Amour Moissonneur,\" which were the beginning of that\nhost of cupids that he let fly from his studio; they frolic across his\ncanvases and join the retinue of Venus, peeping out from clouds, over\nwaves, round curtains, painted with a perfection that has never been\nsurpassed in the portrayal of infants. He painted their round limbs,\ntheir lusty life, their delightful awkwardnesses, their jolly fat\ngrace, their na\u00efve surprise at life and glory in it, as they had never\nbeen painted before, and have never been painted since.\n\nHe also gave forth in this his thirty-third year a \"Pastoral\" and a\n\"Shepherd and Shepherdess in Conversation,\" with sheep about them and\nin a pleasant landscape, which were his first essays in the style that\nhe created and which made him famous.\n\nHis friend Meissonnier, the inventor of the rococo, stood godfather to\nBoucher's first-born son in the May of 1736.\n\nFrom the very beginning Boucher seems to have been engraved. And these\nengravings, done by the best gravers of his day, greatly extended his\nreputation and popularised him; he fully realised the value of the\nadvertisement as well as his profits from it. Before his thirty-third\nyear was run out he published his well-known \"Cries of Paris.\"\n\nBoucher's description of them, \"studies from the low classes,\" holds\nthe key to that something of failure to realise the dramatic verities\nthat is over all; it gives also the attitude of the France that he\nknew towards the France that he did not, and could not understand. He\ncreated that dainty, pleasant atmosphere that comes floating up to the\nwindows on a fresh morning in Paris from the musical cries of\nthe street vendors; but of the deeper significance of the\nstreet-sellers--of the miserable accent in their life, of their weary\ntoil, of the dignity of their labour--he knew nothing; his brush could\nnot refrain from making elegance and fine manners peep from behind the\nstreet-porter's fustian or the milkmaid's skirt.\n\nBut his thirty-third year was to contain a more far-reaching\nsignificance even than the creation of his cupid-pieces and pastorals.\n\nThe \"Cries of Paris\" were scarce printed when Boucher's illustration\nto \"Don Quixote\" appeared--\"Sancho pursued by the servants of the\nDuke.\" This design was to have far-reaching results that Boucher\nlittle suspected.\n\nThe painter Oudry had been called to the conduct of the great tapestry\nlooms at Beauvais a couple of years before; and in his efforts to\nfurnish the looms with good designs, he now called Boucher to his aid,\nwhose original and fresh style, colour, and arrangement, together with\nhis personal vision, and the enthusiasm and zeal with which he threw\nhimself into the work, at once increased the reputation and the\nproducts of the famous looms. This large designing for the tapestries\nwas, in return, of immense value to the development of the genius of\nthe man, enlarging his breadth of style and giving scope to that great\ndecorative sense that was his superb gift. Thenceforth he was destined\nto play a supreme part in the history of the world-famed factories. He\nnow produced painting after painting for the Beauvais looms.\n\nLife is now one long triumph for Boucher, only disturbed in this year\nby the sad news of the suicide of his old master, Lemoyne. It was in\nthis, Boucher's thirty-fourth year, that the Salon was opened for the\nfirst time since Boucher's infancy, and he contributed several\ncanvases to it.\n\nRigaud, the old Academician, now close upon eighty, straggling through\nthe great galleries, might well blink and gasp at the change that had\ncome over French art since he last exhibited there, thirty-three years\ngone by; but his scoffs and regrets held no terrors for the younger\nAcademicians gathered about. He stood in a new world. A new generation\nwas in possession. The grand manner, the severe etiquette, formal\nmock-heroics, and solemn pomposity of Louis the Fourteenth were\nvanished, and the Agreeable and the Pleasant Make-Believe of Louis the\nFifteenth reigned in their stead. Old Rigaud might blink indeed! Just\nas the imposing and stilted etiquette of the reception-room had given\nplace to the easy manners and airy etiquette of the dainty boudoir, so\nhad light chatter and gay wit and the quick repartee usurped the heavy\nsplendours of a consequential age. France, weary of an eternal pose of\nthe grand manner, was seeking change in joyousness and amusement.\n\nGallantry and gaiety were become the object of the ambition of a\ndandified and elegant day. France became a coquette; dressed herself\nas a porcelain shepherdess; and with beribboned crook and sheep,\nseeking pleasant prospects to stroll through, gave herself to\ndalliance--her powder-puff and patch-box and fan a serious part of her\nunseriousness.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE CH\u00c2TEAUROUX\n\n\nAt thirty-five Boucher has arrived. He is in the vogue; in favour at\nCourt--as well as in the fashion. In his three years from taking his\nseat at the Academy to the opening of the first Salon he has created a\nnew and original style--his cupid pieces, his pastorals, his\nVenus-pieces, his tapestry. Boucher's kingdom lay in the realm of the\ndecorative painter--and he has found it. Torn from the surroundings\nfor which he designed them, as part and parcel of the general scheme,\nhis pictures are as out of place as an Italian altarpiece in an\nEnglish dining-room, yet they suffer less. Several may still be seen,\nas he set them up in frames of his own planning, as overdoors in the\npalace of the Soubise, now given up to the national archives.\n\nThe ghost of the Prince of Soubise, who commissioned them, may haunt\nhis palace, but his kin know the place no longer. The overdoors\nwrought by Boucher's skill look down now on the nation's collection of\nhistoric documents. The \"Three Graces enchaining Love,\" the fine\npastoral of \"The Cage,\" and the pastoral of the \"Shepherd placing a\nRose in his Shepherdess's Hair,\" were to see a mightier change than\nthe usurpation of Louis the Fourteenth's pompous age by the elegant\nyears of Louis the Fifteenth. But this was not as yet. Here at least\nwe see Boucher's art rid of all outside influences, and at the full\ntide of creation; here we have the inimitable lightness of touch, the\nfigures and landscape bathed in the airy volume of atmosphere.\n\nHe seems at this time to have played with pastel, due probably to his\nfriendship with Latour, who sent a portrait of Boucher's wife to this\nSalon. Boucher showed in the use of chalks the artistry and skill that\nwere always at his command.\n\nHe also was putting to its full use his innate sense of landscape,\nraising to high achievement that astonishing balance of landscape and\nfigures in his design--a balance that has never been surpassed; his\nfigures never override his landscape; his landscape never overpowers\nhis figures. His earnest counsels to his pupils and his constant\ndeploring of the lack of the landscape art in France prove the great\nstress he laid upon it.\n\nThe designing of a frontispiece for the catalogue of a personal\nfriend, one Gersaint, a merchant of oriental wares, started Boucher in\nhis thirty-third year upon that series of Chinese pictures and\ntapestries known as the \"Chinoiseries,\" in which he frittered away\nonly too many precious hours, for they were received with great favour\nby the public. The paintings of Chinese subjects designed for the\nlooms of Beauvais are still to be seen at Besan\u00e7on.\n\nBut busy as were his brain and hand in the exercise of his wide and\nversatile gifts, pouring out \"Chinoiseries,\" illustrations for books,\ntapestries on a large scale, landscapes, models for the gilt bronze\ndecorations of porcelain vases, scheming handsome frames for his\npictures, designing furniture and fans--Boucher was true, above all,\n\"to his goddess,\" and painted the famed \"Birth of Venus,\" which,\nthanks to the Swedish Ambassador's fondness for Madame Boucher, now\nhangs at Stockholm; our amorous Count de Tessin, to be just, seems to\nhave had a rare flair for the artistic--besides artist's wives. It was\non the 15th of April in 1742, the last year of his thirties, that the\nRoyal favour was marked by the grant of a pension of 400 livres\n(double florins) to Boucher with promise of early benefits to follow.\n\nTwo years afterwards it was raised to 600 livres.\n\nThis was the year that he painted the beautiful canvas of \"Diana\nleaving the Bath with one of her Companions,\" now at the Louvre. It\nwas also the year that saw his landscape, the \"Hamlet of Iss\u00e9\" at the\nSalon. This \"Hameau d'Iss\u00e9\" was to be enlarged for the Opera, proving\nhim to be decorator there, where he was arranging waterfalls,\ncascades, and the rest of the pretty business, without staying his\nhand from his art.\n\nAt forty Boucher has come into his kingdom. The ten years of these\nforties were to be a vast triumph for him. He was to produce\nmasterpiece after masterpiece. His art had caught the taste of the\nday. He was at the height of his powers. He had done great things--he\nwas to do greater. During these ten years of his forties he poured\nforth vivid and glowing works of sustained power and originality.\n\nWe have a picture of him as he was in the flesh at this time--the\npastel portrait by Lundberg, now at the Louvre--a gay, somewhat\ndissipated, handsomely dressed dandy of the time, smiling out of his\ncareless day, the debonnair man of fashion, the laughing eyes showing\nsigns of the night carousals, which were the rest from the prodigious\ntoil of this vital and forthright spirit.\n\nIt was in this our artist's fortieth year that the gifted old Cardinal\nFleury, who had guided the fortunes of France with rare skill, died,\nbroken by his ninety years and the blunders of the disastrous war that\nhe had so strenuously opposed; and Louis, essaying the strut of\nkingship, became king by act. His indolent character, unequal to the\nmighty business, his indeterminate will fretted by the set of\nquarrelling and intriguing rogues that he gathered about him as his\nministers, he fell into the habit that became his thenceforth, the\nonly thing to which he paid the tribute of constancy--he ruled France\nfrom behind pretty petticoats. He had early shown the adulterous blood\nof his great-grandfather; two, if not three, of five sisters of the\nnoble and historic house of De Nesle had yielded to his gadding fancy;\nthe youngest now ousted her sister De Mailly from the king's favour,\nwas publicly acknowledged as the king's mistress, and became Duchess\nof Ch\u00e2teauroux. Boucher painted her handsome being as a shepherdess in\none of his pastorals. She was no ordinary toy of a king. A woman of\ntalent, with hot ambitions for the king's majesty, fired with the\npride of race of the old French noblesse, it was during her short\nyears of ascendancy over the king that he roused from his body's\ntorpor and made an effort to reach the dignity and eminence befitting\nto the lord of a great and gallant people. He stepped forth awhile\nfrom his drunken bouts and manifold mean adulteries, and set himself\nat the head of the army in Flanders, and strutted it as conqueror.\n\nPoor Ch\u00e2teauroux only got the hate of the people for reward, Louis the\nhonours; for the people resented the public dishonour of her state.\n\nPower she found to be a dead-sea apple in her pretty mouth. The glory\nof it all, the splendours, were not the easily won delights for which\nshe had looked. She had to fight a duel, that never ended, with the\nking's witty, crafty, and scurrilous Prime Minister, the notorious\nMaurepas--and Maurepas willed that no woman should ever come between\nhim and the king--Maurepas who knew no mercy, no decency, no chivalry,\nno scruple. At Ch\u00e2teauroux's urging, Louis placed himself at the\nhead of the army; and France went near mad with joy that she had\nagain found a king. Crafty Maurepas urged on the business; the\nCh\u00e2teauroux suddenly realised his cunning glee--it separated her from\nthe king.\n\nOut of the whirl of things Boucher's fortune was ripening, little as\nhe might suspect it.\n\nHe was painting masterpieces that make his name live. To his fortieth\nyear belong the famed \"Birth of Venus,\" the \"Venus leaving the Bath,\"\nthe \"Muse Clio,\" the \"Muse Melpomene,\" and the three well-known\npastorals now at the Louvre--\"The Sleeping Shepherdess,\" the \"Nest,\"\n\n\nand the \"Shepherd and Shepherdesses.\" Of the many famous Venus-pieces\nthat his hand painted during these years it is not easy to write the\nlist. But having signed the \"Marriage of Love and Psyche\" at\nforty-one, he turned his experimental hand to the homely, realistic\nDutch style that was having a wide vogue, and painted the\n\"Dejeuner\"--a family of the prosperous class of the day at\nbreakfast--showing with rare charm the surroundings and home life of\nthe well-to-do of his time.\n\nAll goes well with Boucher. He changes into better quarters in the Rue\nde Grenelle-Saint-Honor\u00e9, where he lived for the next five years,\nuntil 1749; but his eyes are fixed upon a studio and apartments at\nthe old palace of the Louvre, though the hard intriguing of his\npowerful friends at Court on his behalf failed for some time. He had,\nindeed, to make another move before he arrived at his longed-for goal.\n\nPensions Boucher, like others, had found to be somewhat empty affairs;\nbut rooms at the Louvre were a solid possession eagerly sought after\nby the artists.\n\nIn this year of 1744 Boucher created a new fashion at the annual Salon\nby sending studies and sketches instead of finished pictures; and it\nset a value upon such things not before realised by artists, for\nsuccess was instant and loud.\n\nTowards the end of the next, Boucher's forty-second year, the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who was to take his leave of Paris,\ncommissioned four pictures to represent the day of a woman of fashion,\nand to be entitled \"Morning,\" \"Midday,\" \"Evening,\" and \"Night.\"\n\nBoucher painted one of these for him, now known as the \"Marchande de\nModes.\" The others were painted later, and all had a wide vogue as\nengravings. The correspondence has interest since it reveals Boucher's\nbusiness habits; he was paid for a picture on its delivery, and for\neach of these he was to receive 600 livres (double florins or\ndollars)--about a hundred and twenty pounds.\n\nIn an official document of the Director of Buildings to the king (or\nMinister of Fine Art, as we should say), written in this year of 1745,\nBoucher being forty-two, is a \"list of the best painters,\" in which\nBoucher is singled out for distinction as \"an historic painter, living\nin the Rue de Grenelle-Saint-Honor\u00e9, opposite the Rue des Deux-Ecus,\npupil of Lemoyne, excelling also in landscape, grotesques, and\nornaments in the manner of Watteau; and equally skilled in painting\nflowers, fruit, architecture, and subjects of gallantry and of\nfashion.\"\n\nNot so bad for dry officialdom; the critics could learn a lesson. For\nhe was nothing less. What indeed does he not do? and wondrous well!\nthis painter of the age.\n\nAnd the mighty rush of events is about to sweep him into further\nprominence; the very things which he probably passed by with a gay\nshrug are to enrich him, to help him to his highest fulfilment.\n\nPoor Ch\u00e2teauroux saw that she must lose the king's gadding favour in\nthe conflict with Maurepas unless she joined her lord, now with the\narmy. She realised full well that she had created the new Louis of\nAmbition--that her going must bring the people's hate to her. But she\ndared not lose the king. And she went. Maurepas had overdone his\njibings. The indiscretion at once rang through the land; became the\njest of the army--and Maurepas was not far from the bottom of the\nbusiness. The discreet indiscretion of covered ways between the king's\nlodgings and hers only added to the mockeries, and increased the\npeople's hate against, of course, the Ch\u00e2teauroux. Then upon a day in\nAugust the small-pox seized Louis at Metz; poor Ch\u00e2teauroux fought for\npossession of the king in the sick room, until his fear of\ndeath--Louis' sole piety--sent her packing--shrinking back in the\nhired carriage at each halting-place for change of horses, lest she\nshould be seen and torn from her place and destroyed by the populace.\n\nBut Louis recovered; Paris rang with bells at joy on his recovery, and\nhe entered the city amidst mad enthusiasm, hailed as The Well-Beloved.\n\nHe sent for the Ch\u00e2teauroux to find her dying, Maurepas having to\ndeliver the message of recall. She died suddenly and in great agony,\nswearing that Maurepas had poisoned her--died in the arms of her poor\ndiscarded sister, the De Mailly.\n\nBut this year of 1745 Boucher hears a mightier scandal that is to mean\nvast things to all France--and not least of all to Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE POMPADOUR\n\n\nA young bride had become the gossip of the rich merchant society of\nParis--that class that was ousting the old noblesse from power. She\nwas a beautiful, a remarkable woman; her wit was repeated in the\ndrawing-rooms, she had all the accomplishments; her charming\nname--Madame Lenormant d'Etioles.\n\nDraw aside the curtains of the past and we discover our little Jeanne\nPoisson--grown into this exquisite creature. It has come about in\nstrange fashion enough. The father--a scandalous fellow--having\nfingered the commissariat moneys in ugly ways to his own use, had been\nbanished for the ugly business. Nor is Jeanne's mother any better than\nshe should be; and the wags wink knowingly at the handsome and rich\nman of fashion, Monsieur Lenormant de Tournehem, who has been the\nfavoured gallant during the absence of the light-fingered Poisson.\n\nAnd, of a truth, Lenormant de Tournehem takes astonishing interest in\nthe little Jeanne--watching over her up-growing and giving her the\nbest of education at the convent, where she wins all hearts, and is\nknown as \"the little queen.\" The truth spoken with wondrous prophecy,\nif unthinkingly, as we shall see. Complacent Poisson came home, and\ntook the rich and fashionable, bland and smiling Lenormant de\nTournehem to his arms. Has he not wealth and estates? therefore as\nexcellent a friend for Poisson as for Madame Poisson. The girl Jeanne\nleaves the convent to be taught the accomplishments by the supreme\nmasters of France, the wits foregather at Madame Poisson's, and the\nbrilliant Jeanne is soon mistress of the arts--coquetry not least of\nall; has also the most exquisite taste in dress. Under all is a heart\ncold as steel; calculating as the higher mathematics. She has but one\nhindrance to ambition--her mean birth. Lenormant de Tournehem rids her\neven of this slur by making his nephew, Lenormant d'Etioles, marry\nher, giving the young couple half his fortune for dowry, and the\npromise of the rest when he dies--also he grants him a splendid\ntown-house, as splendid a country seat. And consequential\nself-respecting little Lenormant d'Etioles is lord of Etioles, amongst\nother seignories. So Jane Fish appears as Madame Lenormant d'Etioles,\nseductive, beautiful, accomplished, to whose house repair the new\nphilosophy, the wits, and artists. She has a certain sense of virtue;\nindeed openly vows that no one but the king shall ever come between\nher and her lord. But, deep in her heart, she has harboured a fierce\nambition--that the king shall help her to keep her bond. She puts\nforth all her gifts, all her powers, to win to the strange goal;\nconfides it to her worldly mother and \"uncle,\" Lenormant de Tournehem;\nfinds keen allies therein to the reaching of that strange goal. The\ndeath of the Ch\u00e2teauroux clears the way. At a masked ball the king is\nintrigued as to the personality of a beautiful woman who plagues him\nwith her art; he orders the unmasking. Madame Lenormant d'Etioles\nstands revealed, drops her handkerchief as by accident; the whisper\nruns through the Court that \"the handkerchief has been thrown!\" The\nking stoops and picks it up. A few evenings later she is smuggled into\nthe \"private apartments.\" She goes again a month later; in the morning\nis seized with sudden terror--she daren't go back to her angry lord\nlest he do her grievous harm; he will have missed her. The king is\ntouched; allows her to hide from henceforth in the secret apartments;\npromises the beautiful creature a lodging, her husband's banishment,\nand early acknowledgment as titular mistress--before the whole Court\nat Easter, says the pious Great One. But he has to join the army to\nplay the Conqueror at Fontenoy; and it is later in the year\n(September) before Madame d'Etioles is presented to the Court in a\nvast company and proceeds to the queen's apartments to kiss hands on\nappointment. Thus was Jeanne Poisson raised to the great aristocracy\nof France in her twenty-third year as Marquise de Pompadour.\n\nBoucher had been one of the brilliant group of artists of the\nd'Etioles' circle. That the Pompadour's influence had much effect upon\nhis position at Court for a year or two is unlikely; for she had to\nfight for possession of the king day and night, as the Ch\u00e2teauroux\nhad done, against the queen's party and the unscrupulous enmity of\nMaurepas. To set down Boucher's favour at Court to her is ridiculous.\n\nHe was painting for the queen's apartments at thirty-one when the\nPompadour was a school-girl of twelve. But in the year following her\nrise to power, Boucher painted four pictures for the large room of the\nDauphin, which were \"placed elsewhere\"; and, the year after that, he\nwas at work upon two pictures for the bedroom of the king at the\ncastle of Marly. It is likely enough that the Pompadour directed this\norder. She had almost immediately secured the office of the\nDirector-General of Buildings, which covered the direction of the\nroyal art treasures, for \"uncle\" Lenormant de Tournehem, who was also\na friend of the artist. And from this year it is significant that\nBoucher paints no more for the opposing camp of the Queen and Dauphin.\n\nHe was now giving all his strength to the \"Rape of Europa\" that he\npainted for the competition ordered by the Academy at the command of\nLenormant de Tournehem in the king's name, in which ten chosen\nAcademicians were to paint subjects in their own style for six prizes\nand a gold medal, to be awarded in secret vote by the competing\nartists themselves. Boucher won, by his amiable nature, the good-will\nof them all by proposing that they should so arrange as to share the\nprizes equally, and thus prevent any sense of soreness inevitable in\nthe losers.\n\nBut greatly as he won the good-fellowship of his fellow-artists by it,\nthis picture caused a murmur to rise amongst the critics who,\naforetime loud in his praise, now began to complain of his \"abuse of\nrose tints\" in the painting of the female nude. The fact was that\nDiderot and the men of the New Philosophy were turning their eyes to\nthe whole foundations upon which France was built, art as well as\nsociety, and were beginning to demand of art \"grandeur and morality in\nits subjects.\" They were soon to be clamouring for \"the statement of a\ngreat maxim, a lesson for the spectator.\" Diderot, with bull-like\ncourage, picked out the greatest, and turned upon Boucher, blaming him\nfor triviality.\n\nThe nations, weary of war, concluded the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in\nthe October of 1748. No sooner was peace concluded than Louis\nrelapsed into his old habit of dandified indolence and profligate\nease; and, putting from him his duties as the lord of a great people,\nhe gave himself up to shameless intrigues. He allowed the Pompadour to\nusurp his magnificence and to rule over the land. He yielded himself\nutterly, if sometimes sulkily, to her domination; and for sixteen\nyears she was the most powerful person at Court, the greatest force in\nthe state--making and unmaking ministers, disposing of office,\nhonours, titles, pensions. All political affairs were discussed and\narranged under her guidance; ministers, ambassadors, generals\ntransacted their business in her stately boudoirs; the whole patronage\nof the sovereign was dispensed by her pretty hands; the prizes of the\nChurch, of the army, of the magistracy could be obtained solely\nthrough her favour and good-will. Her energy must have been\nprodigious. Possessed of extraordinary talents and exquisite tastes,\nshe gave full rein to them, and it was in the indulgence of her better\nqualities that Destiny brought Boucher into the friendship of this\nwonderful woman. She became not only his patron but his pupil,\nengraving several of his designs.\n\nBut this, her sovereignty over the king, easy and light in its outward\nseeming, was a haggard nightmare to the calculating woman who had so\nlonged for it. She knew no single hour's rest from the night she won\nto the king's bed. She had to fight her enemies, secret and open, for\npossession of the king's will, day and night; and she fought--with\nrare courage. She won by consummate skill and unending pluck. She made\nherself an essential part of the king's freedom from care. The Court\nparty fought her for power with constant vigilance. Maurepas brought\nall his unscrupulous art, all his ironic mimicry, all his vile jibes\nand unchivalrous hatred to bear against her. He had made himself a\nnecessity to the king; and he never slept away a chance of injuring\nher. He knew no mercy, no nobility, no pity. He made her the detested\nobject of the people. With his own hands he penned the witty verses\nand epigrams that were sung and flung about the streets of Paris.\n\nBut she had an enemy more subtle than any at the Court--hour by hour\nshe had to dispute the king with the king's boredom. And it was in the\neffort to do so that she created her celebrated theatre in the\nprivate apartments, calling Boucher and others to her aid in the doing\nof it. Here the noblest of France vied with each other to obtain the\nsmallest part to play, an instrument in its orchestra, an invitation\nto its performances.\n\nBoucher left the Opera to become its decorator in 1748, and did not\nreturn until her death. For her, he also decorated her beautiful rooms\nat Bellevue. She bought at high prices many of his greatest\nmasterpieces.\n\nThe Pompadour's power so greatly increased that she openly took\ncommand of the king's will; dared and succeeded in getting his\nfavourite Maurepas banished; and herself took to the use of the kingly\n\"we.\" Her rascally father was created Lord of Marigny; her brother,\nwhom the king liked well and called \"little brother,\" was created\nMarquis de Vandi\u00e8res; her only child, Alexandrine, signed her name as\na princess of the blood royal, and would have been married to the\nblood royal had she not caught the small-pox and died. She amassed a\nprivate fortune, castles, and estates such as no mistress had dreamed\nof; and into them she poured art treasures that cost the nation\nthirty-six millions of money. She created the porcelain factory of\nS\u00e8vres, kept keen watch over the Gobelins looms, and founded the great\nMilitary School of St. Cyr amidst work that would have kept several\nstatesmen busy, and of deadly intrigues at Court that would have\nbroken the spirit of many a brilliant man.\n\nIt was in her hectic desire to keep the king from being bored that she\nstooped, and made Boucher stoop, to the employment of his high\nartistry in the painting of a series of indecent pictures wherewith to\ntickle the jaded desires of Boredom, and thereby gave rise to the\nwidespread impression that Boucher's art was ever infected by base\ndesign. But Boucher was, at his very worst, but a healthy animal; and\neven in these secret works for the king he did not reach so low as did\nmany an artist of more pious memory who painted with no excuse but his\nown pleasure.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the Pompadour has been blamed too much for this\nevil act, and too much forgotten for her splendid patronage of the man\nwho, under it and during these great years of his forties, produced a\nseries of masterpieces that place him in the foremost rank of the\npainters of his century. It is impossible to reckon the number of the\npastorals and Venus-pieces that his master-hand painted and loved to\npaint, during these the supreme years of his genius. It is significant\nthat they were painted during the years that saw the Pompadour in\nsupreme power.\n\nBoucher was so firmly established in 1750, his forty-seventh year,\nthat he moved into a new house in the Rue Richelieu, near the Palais\nRoyal. Disappointed in not receiving a studio and apartments at the\nLouvre, he was allowed to use a studio in the king's library. He was\nnow making money so easily that he was able to collect pictures and\nprecious stones and the gaily coloured curiosities that appealed to\nhis tastes.\n\nThe critics were becoming more and more censorious; and one of them\nhits true with the comment that in his pastorals his shepherdesses\nlook as if they had stepped over from the Opera and would soon be off\nagain thereto.\n\nIn his forty-eighth year Boucher's art was at its most luminous\nstage--his atmosphere clear and subtle and exquisitely rendered; his\nyellows golden; his whites satin-like and silvery; his flesh-tones\nupon the nude bodies of his goddesses unsurpassed by previous art. The\nbeauty of it all was not to last much longer.\n\nLenormant de Tournehem died suddenly in the November of 1751; the\nPompadour's brother, Abel Poisson de Vandi\u00e8res, was appointed\nDirector-General in his stead at the age of twenty-five--and soon\nafterwards, on the death of his father, created Marquis de Marigny--a\nshy, handsome youth, a gentleman and an honourable fellow, whom the\nking liked well, and against whom his sister's sole complaint was that\nhe lacked the brazen effrontery of the courtiers of the day. No man\ndid more for the advancement of the art of his time. A pension of a\nthousand livres falling vacant, the young fellow secured it for\nBoucher; and almost immediately afterwards, a studio becoming vacant\nat the Louvre owing to the death of Coypel, first painter to the king,\nBoucher came to his coveted home, eagerly moving in with his family as\nsoon as its wretched state could be put into repair.\n\nThe decoration of the new wing to the palace at Fontainebleau brought\nthe commission for the painting of the ceiling and the principal\npicture in the Council Chamber to Boucher, who had already decorated\nthe Dining-Room. This was the period of his painting the \"Rising\" and\nthe \"Setting of the Sun\" for the Pompadour, now in the Watteau\ncollection, two canvases that were always favourites with the painter,\nbitterly as they were assailed by the critic Grimm.\n\nHe was turning out so much work that it was impossible to give as much\ncare to his pictures as he ought. For he refused sternly, his life\nlong, to raise his prices; by consequence he had to create a larger\namount of work in order to meet his expenditure. It was about this\ntime that Reynolds, passing through Paris, went to visit him and found\nhim painting on a huge canvas without models or sketches. \"On\nexpressing my surprise,\" writes Reynolds, \"he replied that he had\nconsidered the model as necessary during his youth until he had\ncompleted his study of art, but that he had not used one for a long\ntime past.\"\n\nHe soon had not the time, not only to paint from nature but even to\ngive his pictures the work necessary to complete them. The feverish\nhaste which took possession of him in his frantic endeavour to meet\nthe vast demand for his pictures, and the eager efforts of his\nengravers to satisfy the public call for engravings after his works,\ngave him less and less leisure to joy in their doing. And his eyesight\nbegan to fail. His flesh-tints deepened to a reddish hue; and he\nstands baffled before his work, suspecting his sight, since what every\none cries out upon as being bright vermilion, he only sees as a dull\nearthy colour. Boucher has topped the height of his achievement; he\nhas to \"descend the other side of the hill.\" Boucher begins to grow\nold.\n\nIn Boucher's fifty-first year an ugly intrigue of the queen's party at\nCourt to sap the Pompadour's influence over the king by drawing away\nthe king's affections towards Madame de Choiseul-Romanet, a reckless\nyoung beauty of the Court, brought about a strange alliance. The Count\nde Stainville, one of the Pompadour's bitterest enemies, was shown the\nking's letter of invitation to his young kinswoman; and he, deeply\nwounded in his pride that his kinswoman should have been offered to\nthe king, went to the Pompadour and exposed the plot. A close\nalliance followed; and De Stainville thenceforth became her chief\nguide in affairs of state. It was at her instance that the king called\nhim to be his Prime Minister, raising him to the Duchy of Choiseul--a\nname he made illustrious as one of the greatest Ministers of France.\n\nIn his fifty-second year Boucher was appointed to the directorship of\nthe Gobelins looms, to the huge delight of the weavers and all\nconcerned with the tapestry factory. This was the year of his painting\nthe famous portrait of the Pompadour, to whom he several times paid\nthis \"tribute of immorality.\" For the Gobelins looms he produced many\nhandsome designs; and he was painting with astounding industry. But\nhis hand's skill began to falter. His art shows weariness in his\nsixtieth year, and sickness fell upon him, and held him in servitude\nnow with rare moments of respite. The critics, notoriously Diderot,\nwere now attacking him with shameless virulence. Boucher passed it all\nby; but he felt the change that was taking place in the public taste.\n\nThe ideas of the New Philosophy were infecting public opinion; the Man\nof Feeling had arisen in the land; and France, humiliated in war, and\nresenting the follies and the greed of her shameless privileged class,\nwas openly resenting it and all its works. Choiseul had planted his\nstrength deep in the people's party, and was come near to being its\ngod. His masterly mind had checked Frederick of Prussia to the North;\nand the nations, exhausted by the struggle, signed the Peace of Paris\nin 1763. Choiseul, with France at peace abroad, turned to the blotting\nout of the turbulent order of the Jesuits at home. Their attempt to\nend the Pompadour's relations with the king made this powerful woman\neager to complete his design; the chance was soon to come, and the\nOrder was abolished from France and its vast property seized by the\nstate.\n\nThe Pompadour lived but a short while to enjoy her triumph. Worn out\nby her superhuman activities, assailed by debt, she fell ill of a\nracking cough, dying on the 15th of April, 1764, in her forty-second\nyear, keeping her ascendancy over the king and the supreme power in\nFrance to her last hour. Death found her transacting affairs of state.\n\nLouis, weary of his servitude, had only a heartless epigram to cast\nat the body of the dead woman as she passed to her last resting-place.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE END\n\n\nThe death of the Pompadour robbed Boucher of a friend; but her\nbrother, Marigny, remained faithfully attached to the old artist, and\nseized every chance to honour him. On the death of Carle van Loo,\nBoucher, at sixty-two, was made first painter to the king, with all\nhis pensions and privileges that were consistent with this the supreme\nappointment in the art world.\n\nThere had been serious intention of making Boucher the head of the\nEcole des El\u00e8ves Proteg\u00e9s; he had the art of making himself liked and\nof inspiring the love of the arts. He was very popular with the\nstudents and artists, owing to his kindliness, his eagerness to render\nservice, his readiness to encourage the youngsters or to console them.\n\nWhen the riot took place, provoked by the Academicians by their award\nof the Prix de Rome in 1767, the students insulted the Academicians,\nbut hailed Boucher with enthusiastic applause. The reason was not far\nto seek. When a student came to the old master for advice he did not\n\"play the pontiff,\" and, scorning the false dignity of big phrases, he\ntook the brush in his hand and showed the way out of all difficulties\nby simplehearted example, despising rules, and putting himself out in\norder to make things clear to a young artist.\n\nHowever, the Academicians feared he would be an unorthodox master for\nyouth, and appointed another in his place.\n\nA long and serious illness thwarted his keen energies. Diderot was\ngiving himself up to outrageous violence against him. If the old\npainter exhibited at the Salon, Diderot fiercely assailed his art; if\nhe did not exhibit, Diderot as bitterly assailed him for his\nnegligences. Above all, he attacked Boucher in that he did not paint\nwhat Diderot would have painted--but could not. \"When he paints\ninfants,\" cries Diderot, \"you will not find one employed in a real act\nof life--studying his lesson, reading, writing, stripping hemp.\"\n\nPoor unfortunate infants! for whom Philosophy could find no happier\njoy in life than stripping hemp! Boucher was but an artist. He\npainted his generation as far as he could see it, and, with all his\nfaults and weaknesses, he never debauched his art with foreign and\nalien things that had no part in the nation's life; he painted fair\nFrance into his landscapes, not a make-believe land he did not know\nwith preposterous Greek ruins; and best of all, to his eternal honour,\nhe painted infants glad in their gladness to be alive, with no desire\nto send their happy little bodies to school, with no sickly ambition\nto make them into budding philosophers, with no thought of making them\npose and lie as Men of Feeling. He had no joy in setting their little\nbodies to toil--in making them \"teach a lesson to the spectator,\" in\nmaking them stoop their little shoulders to the \"picking of hemp.\"\n\nHe continued to paint as he had always painted--except that he painted\nless well. The wreath of roses was wilting on a grey head. The blood\njigged less warmly in the frail body. The features showed pallid--the\neyes haggard. The sight failed. The hand alone kept something of its\ncunning.\n\nHe went to Holland with his friend Randon du Boisset, but health\nshrank farther from him. Diderot had near spent his last jibe.\n\nIn 1768, Boucher's sixty-fifth year, the neglected queen went to her\ngrave. The king's grief and contrition and vows to amend his life came\ntoo late, and lasted little longer than the drying of the floods of\ntears over the body of his dead consort. A year later he was become\nthe creature of a pretty woman of the gutters, whom he caused to be\nmarried to the Count du Barry--the infamously famous Madame du Barry.\n\nBut neither the remonstrances of Choiseul with the king against this\nfurther degradation of the throne of France, nor his unconcealed scorn\nof the upstart countess, nor the dangerous enemy he made for himself\nthereby, signified now to Boucher, first painter to the king.\n\nBoucher was failing. His son was a prig and a disappointment. His two\nfavourite pupils, Baudoin and Deshayes, who had married his two girls,\ndied.\n\nTo the Salon of 1769 he sent his \"Caravan of Bohemians.\" It was his\nlast display. He had been going about for some time like a gaunt ghost\nof his former self, afflicted with all the ills inevitable to a life\nfeverishly consumed in work and the pursuit of pleasure.\n\nThey went to his studio at five of the clock one May morning, and\nfound him seated at his easel, before a canvas of Venus, dead, with\nthe paint-filled brush fallen out of his fingers.\n\nSo passed he away on the 30th of May 1770, in his sixty-seventh year.\n\nWhen Boucher died, the generation of which he was the limner was near\ncome to its violent end. The rosy carnivals and gay gallantries of his\nage gave way to the blood-stained romance and fierce tempest of the\nRevolution. The garrets of the old curiosity-shops received the\ndiscarded canvases of the master. His shepherds and shepherdesses were\nput to rout by the Romans of his pupil, citizen David. The old order\nwas brought into contempt and overthrown. And with it, Boucher's art,\nlike much that was gracious and charming and good in the evil thing,\nwent down also, and was overwhelmed for a while.\n\nFor a while only. For just as, out of the blood and terror of the\nRevolution, a real France arose, phnix-wise, from the ruin, and in\nbeing born, whilst putting off the vilenesses of the thing from which\nshe sprang, took on also to herself the gracious and winsome qualities\nthat place her amongst the most fascinating peoples of the ages; so\nBoucher has come into his kingdom again--the most gracious of painters\nthat the years have yielded."

                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n        a. One bed, or folding cot,\n        b. One oil stove,\n        c. One lamp,\n        d. Enough supplies of all kinds sufficient for six months,\n        e. Pots, pans, kettles, etc.\nIt is needless to say that positions in Manila and Iloilo were now at\na premium.\n\nWas it possible that teachers were to be sent to places where even the\nnecessaries of life could not be obtained! Was it possible that many\nwould be sent to places so remote that for six months no fresh\nsupplies could be gotten! A mass meeting was held at once, and a\ncommittee was appointed to send a cablegram to the Associated Press\npetitioning aid from the American people at large. Realizing what\nconsternation would be created throughout the United States by such a\nmessage, two of the teachers leaped into a carriage at the close of\nthe meeting and a few moments later were closeted with the chief\nexecutive of the department. As a result the committee was persuaded\nnot to send the cablegram to the Associated Press until by courtesy it\nhad been sent to the President. Of course, this diplomatic move tided\naffairs over and the teachers who had flatly refused to budge from\nManila now agreed to go on to their stations, being assured that\nwhatever action was best would be taken.\n\nThe day had come when we must separate. We were to enter an untried\nand an unknown field. It was fitting that we have a final joyous\nmeeting, so the best orchestra in the archipelago was engaged and we\n\"chased the hours with flying feet\" until dawn so that whatever might\ncome to us in that unknown future upon which we were entering each\nwould hold in pleasant memory our last evening together.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER III. - A DRAMA IN ACTUAL LIFE.\n\n\nAlmost every one heeded the warning to go to his station forearmed\nwith at least necessaries of life, but, as it had never fallen to the\nlot of the writer to cook, he refused to learn at that late day, so he\ntook no pot, no pan, no kettle, putting his future into the hands of\nan uncertain fate and relying upon the unknown hospitality of the\nFilipino.\n\nBacalod, the capital of the province of Occidental Negros, was our\ndestination. The second morning after leaving Manila, we awoke with\nthe \"Kilpatrick\" lying at anchor in a shallow bay. We were several\nmiles from the shore and nothing in sight indicated that we had\nreached a place of any importance. Late the night before we had been\nawakened by the loud, sharp ringing of the ship's bells, accompanied\nby the reversal of the engines and a general disturbance awaking the\ncrew. So our first impressions on coming on deck were that we had run\naground. But the captain assured us that everything was ship-shape and\nthat this was the nearest point of approach to Capiz, a town of\nconsiderable importance on the island of Panay, where a body of troops\nwas to embark for home. Not even the grass hut of a native was in\nsight. Search as we would, not a sign was seen of a stream flowing\ninto the sea, indicating the probable presence of a town. There was\nnot a sign of life of any kind save one lone column of thin, blue\nsmoke that arose from the side of a mountain miles away. One would\nhave thought that we were explorers of three hundred years ago lying\noff the shore of some unknown land.\n\nAfter breakfast the steam launch, together with all the boats, was\nlowered, and several of us who had determined to miss no opportunity\nto gather information about the islands took our places in the launch\nby the side of the ship's mate, and steamed away across the water with\na long line of boats strung out in the rear. We headed away toward a\ngroup of cocoanut trees, and about an hour later stepped ashore on a\npile of decayed coral rocks that extended some twenty or thirty feet\nout into the water, thus forming the only landing place of a town of\nseveral thousands of people and of considerable commercial importance.\n\nA few moments after we had landed, an army wagon drawn by a\nmagnificent pair of mules came up out of a tropical jungle along a\nnarrow road. We clambered into the wagon and were soon lost in the\ndepths of foliage from which we had just seen the vehicle emerge.\n\nLong waving bamboos with their plumy leafage hung over the road from\neach side, meeting and overlapping in the center until they formed an\narchway so dense that the tropical sun now high in the heavens\npenetrated it only at intervals. At times the wagon sank up to the\nhubs in the soft earth, and the muscles of the mules stood out like\nwhip-cords under the skin as they drew us forward.\n\nAt a sharp turn in the road we came upon the first division of troops\nthat was to embark for home. The look of joy upon their sun-browned\nfaces was inexpressible. Their work was done, and with elastic step\nand smiling faces they saluted us as they passed by. The reign of\nforce was at an end; it was going out with them; the reign of peace\nhad begun; it was coming in with us.\n\nIn the afternoon when we returned from the town the last of the troops\nhad arrived and, as we drove up, the bugle was sounding the call to\nsupper. We noticed native women mingling with the troops and, indeed,\na native woman was in constant attention waiting upon one of the\nsoldiers with whom we ate. Her clothes were clean, her hair was nicely\ncombed, and her general appearance was neat. She seemed to anticipate\nthe slightest wish of the soldier with whom she was. She brought him\nwater to drink, cleaned his plate after the meal and saw that his\nknife, fork, and spoon were put into his haversack.\n\nWe had now finished supper and the launch had returned for the last\nload of troops. The lieutenant in command of the company gave the\norder to \"fall in\"; the men shouldered their rifles and fell into\nline. \"Forward, march!\" called the lieutenant, and the column swept\nforward towards the boats. The women had until now restrained\nthemselves, but, as their husbands marched away never to return, their\nfeelings could no longer be restrained. One young woman of about\neighteen, who was leaning against a rock by the roadside sobbing, when\nher husband passed, leaped up in frenzy of passionate love and caught\nthe rifle from his shoulder. Her first impulse seemed to be to throw\nthe gun away, but suddenly realizing the futility of such an act she\nburst into tears, shouldered the rifle herself and marched on by his\nside. Another woman of more mature age threw her arms around the legs\nof a tall stalwart man, and drew him bodily from the line.\n\nBut the troops marched on and entered the boats. One woman who had\nbeen unnoticed before came down into the shallow water and caught hold\nof our last boat as if to prevent its leaving, while others stood\nmingling their sobs with the sounds of the wavelets as they broke on\nthe sands. As we passed away, an expectant mother, standing in bold\noutline against the twilight sky, threw up her hands in an agony of\ndespair and then sank upon the stones. The curtain had fallen upon a\ndrama in actual life deeper in pathos than any other we had ever seen\nor ever expected to see. Depth of passion, depth of love! Who can\nfathom the human heart?\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. - WHAT THE TEACHERS DID.\n\n\nThere is a remarkable sameness about the towns in the Philippines.\n\nThey all have a large open square about the middle of the town, around\nthree sides of which are Chinese stores, unless one side lies open to\nthe sea, and on the fourth is the great stone ecclesia. The streets\nrun at right angles to one another and divide up the town into\ncreditable squares.\n\nEverybody in the Philippines lives up-stairs, for the ground is so\nsoaked with water during the rainy season that it is a menace to\nhealth to live upon the ground floor. So even the poorest nippa hut\nis built upon stakes four or five feet above the ground.\n\nBacalod is a typical Philippine town. As we landed, a broad open\nsquare was spread out before us. Two sides of the square were lined\nwith two-story houses in which were Chinese stores below and Filipino\nhomes above. On the third side stood the great stone church in whose\nmassive tower the clock was striking the hour of four, while the\nfourth lay open to the sea that had borne us thither.\n\nWe landed, but it was in a method new to us and one not usually\nemployed by the traveling public.\n\nWhen our sail boat ran aground on the sandy bottom a hundred yards or\nmore from the shore, a crowd of Filipino men who were on the beach\nslowly rolled up their pantaloons and waded out to the rescue,--for\nthe money that was in it. The boat's crew elevated their trousers'\nlegs also and slided down into the water. Each of us then straddled\nthe neck of a Filipino standing in the water and was held by ankles to\nbe steadied while our biped mounts proceeded to the shore.\n\nWe were now on the ground and face to face with the situation. To give\nthe reader an idea of the actual conditions met by the first teachers\nwho went to the Islands, the following is copied from the instructions\ngiven us in Manila:\n    1. There shall be two sessions daily of all schools, and the\n    last hour of the morning session shall be devoted solely to\n    instructing the Filipino teachers.\n\n    2. In cases where teachers are sent to a town in which there\n    is no school-house, they are expected to secure the aid of the\n    people and have one built.\n\n    3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is\n    stopped.\n\n    4. All supplies must be kept under lock and key. In towns\n    where there is no case or box to lock the supplies in, and it\n    is also impossible to get the town council to furnish a case,\n    a requisition may be sent to Manila, and, if an appropriation\n    can be secured, one will be made and sent out.\n\nThus it can be easily seen that we were indeed pioneers. In many\nplaces no school-house was to be found, and in some cases it was even\ndifficult to get the town council to provide a case in which to keep\nthe supplies.\n\nThe work of the teachers was, in short; to \"make the English language\nthe basis of instruction in the public schools.\" On our arrival at\nBacalod two schools were found in progress, for some soldiers had been\ndetailed for the work here previous to our coming. One of these was\nfor boys and the other, for girls. Thus the work here had been in a\nmeasure simplified, but complications that had arisen at Talisay, one\nof the largest and richest towns on the island, demanded a change of\nteachers and the writer was assigned to the place as superintendent.\n\nHere an attempt had been made to start a school but it had failed\nignominiously and a system of education was to be put into operation\nfrom the very start.\n\nThe Filipinos are not strong advocates of co-education, so separate\nschools were to be started for the boys and the girls. The one for the\nboys was gotten well in hand before the one for the girls was\nattempted at all.\n\nA few days after reaching the town and securing a home the\npresidente of the town had it publicly announced that the following\nMonday morning at eight o'clock a public school for boys would be\nopened in a building that had been rented for the purpose by the\nmunicipal council. About the middle of the afternoon of the same day a\nman beat a little drum throughout all the streets of the town to call\nthe people out and the town clerk announced both in Spanish and in the\nnative language that this public school would begin at the time and\nplace mentioned above; that instruction would be free to all who came;\nthat the government would furnish all supplies; and that instruction\nwould be given in the English language. A native principal and\nassistants were employed and everything was ready to begin.\n\nThe official report of the result is as follows:\n    Boys' public school of Talisay, Negros, P. I., began November\n    4, 1901. Forty-three boys present at eight o'clock. Forty-one\n    of them knew \"good morning\" and \"good afternoon\" but do not\n    know the distinction between them. Two of them speak simple\n    Spanish. At eight forty-five, eight more, who had been\n    attending an early morning private school, came in together.\n\n    The books they brought were so varied and so different from\n    one another that it seemed impossible to bring any reasonable\n    degree of order out of such a chaos, and so, after struggling\n    vainly for about a week with the problem, the superintendent\n    by one fell stroke removed everything in use and put in a\n    uniform system, and from that day on the English language has\n    been the basis of instruction in the public schools of\n    Talisay. The work was of necessity very slow at first, but by\n    the end of a year two schools were going nicely and a number\n    of the brightest boys and girls had made really excellent\n    progress.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER V. - A \"BAILE.\"\n\n\nNot long after the arrival of our party at Bacalod we received an\ninvitation to a \"baile\" given in our honor by the inhabitants of\nSilay, a town some ten or twelve miles up the northern coast and one\nnoted for its social life. The invitation was accepted with pleasure,\nand about the middle of the afternoon on the day appointed we were\nclad in the immaculate white of the tropics and steaming away up the\ncoast on board a launch sent for our conveyance. Twilight was still\nlingering on the path of day when we anchored just off shore at the\ntown. A row-boat containing the officials of the city came out to meet\nus and, in due season, we were ushered into a spacious drawing-room\nfilled almost to overflowing with the \u00e9lite of the town. The \u00e9lite of\ntowns in the Philippines speak Spanish, and, as only one or two of our\nparty could at that time boast of more than a formal acquaintance with\nthe Castilian tongue, the exchange of ideas that evening between us\nand the Filipinos was of necessity not very rapid.\n\nThe necessity of easy communication between us was rendered somewhat\nless indispensable by the announcement of supper as soon as we were\nrested from our trip. When we had taken our places at the table a\nyoung Filipino about twenty-five years of age arose and gave a lengthy\ntoast to the recent union of the Philippines with the United States.\n\nBut as we Americans were unable to scale the dizzy heights of his\nclimaxes or sink to the depths of his pathos, we forewent the\npleasures of his oratory and turned our attention to the savory odor\nof lamb, chicken, and roast pig that came slyly stealing up our\nnostrils to send us nerve dispatches about the gastronomic delights of\nour not far distant future.\n\nAt last the toast was ended and the world-wide soup ushered in a long\ntrain of things good to eat, served in a style better fitted to the\ndelights of the appetite than to the formalities of dinners, for, as\nsoon as the pleasant task of one dish was completed by any one, the\nnext was served him at once regardless of the progress made by the\nothers at the table.\n\nThe last course was dulce. The new-comers to the Philippines will\nnot be long in making the acquaintance of this dish, and at all\nmeetings, both public and private, where eatables are served, it\nperforms an important part. It is anything sweet, and it may vary all\nthe way from an india-rubber-like black mixture of cocoanut milk and\ndirty sugar to a really toothsome and respectable confection. No\nmatter of what materials a dish is composed, just so long as it is\nsweet, it is dulce.\n\nAfter paying our respects to this last course, we arose from the table\nand entered a great rectangular room from the center of whose ceiling\nhung a large glass chandelier, a mass of shimmering crystals. In the\nchairs around the room were the wealth, the youth, and the beauty of\nthe town.\n\nThe first and also the last number of every Filipino dance of any\nformality is the \"rigodon.\" The dancers are arranged in a square, or\nquadrangle according to the number participating, and are then led\nthrough a tangled maze of figures that so utterly bewilders the novice\nthat he sinks into his chair at the end of the dance wondering how it\nall came to pass.\n\nWe Americans breathed a sigh of relief when the \"rigodon\" ended, and\nmustered fresh courage for social conquests in the waltz that was now\nbreathing forth from the trembling strings. My companion in the first\ndance had been the young lady by whose side I had sat at dinner. But\nit now became necessary to search for another, so I prudently waited\nto see how partners were chosen, and made no mistake when a few\nmoments later I faced one of the most luscious looking se\u00f1oritas on\nthe opposite side of the room and offered her my arm. My eyes must\nhave told the story that my lips could not utter in Spanish, for she\nsmiled upon me sweetly, arose, and put her hand upon my shoulder. My\narm encircled her waist and I began to waltz. Unfortunately my\ncompanion did not follow, but began to hop up and down in a manner\nmost distressing. Supposing the attack to be only temporary, I paused\nand, much to my relief, she soon showed signs of recovery; and in the\ncourse of time she came to a standstill looking up into my face in an\ninquiring sort of way, apparently wondering why St. Vitus had not paid\nhis respects to me also. A second attempt to follow the music met with\nresults similar to the first, and during the third attempt, which\nseemed to be trembling on the verge of a failure, St. Vitus let go my\ncompanion and seized me with such vigor that she, who was small even\nfor a Filipino, was gathered up bodily and taken around the room at\nsuch a pace that her toes touched the floor only at far distant\nintervals.\n\nAt this point my devotion to the shrine of Terpsichore ceased from\nforce of circumstances and I seated myself in one of the most\ncomfortable chairs in sight that I might carry out a previously formed\nplan to study the Filipino somewhat critically as he appears in\nsociety.\n\nThe first thing that impressed me as the dancers passed up and down\nthe room was the flash of diamonds. Nearly every woman in the room had\non a brooch that flashed the colors of the rainbow at every turn.\n\nAlmost all of them wore one or more rings that showed up brilliantly\nunder the chandelier. Many of the men too, especially the young men,\nwore gems that appeared to be exquisite. A closer inspection showed\nthat some of the gems had flaws and others were of a poor color, but\nno one would have denied that, taken as a whole, it was a really\nbeautiful display.\n\nThe dress of the ladies was richly colored. Many of their skirts were\nof silk covered with hand embroidered flowers, and their filmy pina\nwaists and broad collar pieces were rich with needle-work. They all\nwore a kind of heelless velvet slipper, very common as a dress shoe in\nthe Philippines, or high-heeled patent leather shoes with neatly\nfitting black stockings.\n\nThe men were dressed in white coats and white pantaloons or black\ncoats and white pantaloons. White shirts and collars, together with\nall sorts and styles of cravats and low-cut patent leather shoes with\nhighly colored socks completed their dress.\n\nIt was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money;\nthat they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a\ntable loaded with good things was a fact to which all of us were\nenthusiastic witnesses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VI. - A SKETCH OF LIFE IN THE PHILIPPINES.\n\n\nHouse-keeping in the Philippines presents some interesting phases. Our\nclub of American officials decided to run a mess, so we employed a\ncook and a house boy, then each of us provided himself with a personal\nservant, making a total of six servants for four men--it takes about\nthis proportion of servants to live in any sort of comfort in the\nPhilippines--and launched ourselves boldly upon the sea of domestic\neconomy. But there were shoals ahead of us, for the question of\nregulating servants is one of no small importance in the Philippines,\nand one of its most disadvantageous features is the long chain of\ndependents that usually attends it.\n\nWe gave the cooks so much a day with which to buy supplies in the\nlocal market, for our own table, making him render a daily list of\nexpenditures, and a fixed amount besides to purchase rice and fish for\nhimself and the other servants. Of course, if they wished to vary\ntheir diet and get chicken and fresh pork, which could be had at far\ndistant intervals, it was wholly a matter of their option, but the\nallowance was made on the basis of so much rice and fish a day for\neach. This allowance was about fifteen cents a day in Spanish coin per\nservant.\n\nThus far all was well. We had agreed to give the cook eight dollars a\nmonth in Spanish money, thinking that good wages would procure good\nservice, but the visions of affluence that floated before him on such\nfloods of wealth were so alluring that they drew him from the kitchen\nto the cooler veranda. In less than a week he had employed an\nassistant at four dollars a month; in less than another week that\nassistant had employed him an assistant at two dollars a month; in\nless than another week that assistant to the assistant had employed\nhim an assistant at the princely salary of fifty cents a month; and\nfrom fear that the chain of dependents would end only by our having\nthe whole Filipino race attached to our culinary force, we broke up\nhouse-keeping and went boarding again, choosing that as the less of\nthe two evils.\n\nOur house furnishings were almost wholly Philippine. The table ware\nand the food on the table came from the ends of the earth. The knives\nand forks were made in Germany, the plates were manufactured in\nEngland, the glass ware and table cloth, in the United States. The\noatmeal and flour came from the United States also. The butter came\nfrom Australia, the rice from China, the salt from Russia, and the\nother eatables from sources about as various as their separate names.\n\nSwitzerland furnished the condensed milk and Illinois the canned\ncream. Nearly all of the canned fruit bore labels from Spain.\n\nThus it can easily be seen that life in the Philippines, if lived\naccording to American ideals, is dependent upon a highly developed and\nhighly complex commerce. However, the difficulties of transportation\nand the restriction of large stocks of merchandise to Manila and some\nhalf a dozen other towns, make so great a difference between country\nlife and city life that a short comparison of the two will not be out\nof place, and life in Manila may well be taken as being fairly typical\nof the latter.\n\nLife in Manila is pleasant, but expensive. It is pleasant from the\nfact that it is not only the capital but also metropolis of the\narchipelago. Thus the combination of wealth and high official position\nhas given to Manila a society of the highest and most refined type.\n\nThe process of beautifying and improving the city which is constantly\ngoing on bids fair to give us at no distant day a city of which we may\nwell be proud.\n\nBut let him who intends living well in Manila on a small income bid\nfarewell at once to so idylic a dream, for it costs much to live well\nthere. In the city of Manila one can get almost anything he wishes,\nbut it must be paid for at the price it commands. Especially in the\ncase of eatables, this price is by no means small, because to the\nfirst cost of articles must in most cases be added the expense of\ndistant shipment from American, European, or Australian ports, and not\ninfrequently the cost of long refrigeration must also be taken into\nconsideration. But, expensive though it is, it is very pleasant to\nlive there and those who have once enjoyed it often wish again to\nquaff the cup of its delights.\n\nIn strong contrast to this pleasant life is the life of the quiet\nlittle hamlet away in the distant islands. Indeed, the Filipino from\nthe distant town, who by some good fortune has been to Manila, or, by\na coup de main, has studied in one of the Manila colleges, is looked\nup to in a true hero-worshiping attitude by all who either know him or\nhear of his fame. Life in such a place is one long state of harmless\ninactivity. Not a wave of trouble from the great outer world ever\ndisturbs its peaceful repose. One lounges forever in an air of\nindolent ease and extreme aversion to anything approaching what might\nbe called a respectable effort.\n\nOne arises in the morning about the time the sun's first rays silver\nthe top leaves of the cocoanut trees and then stirs around until nine\nor ten o'clock, when it is found expedient to avoid a further exposure\nto the sun. From then until about five o'clock in the afternoon it is\nbest to take things as they come, even though one of those things be a\nFilipino dinner. But then you may have your vehiclo attached to a\nyoung bull with a ring in his nose and go for a drive. If it is the\ndry season you will probably enjoy the drive unless you object to the\nfrequent clouds of dust swept along by the evening wind. If it is in\nthe rainy season your pleasure will depend to a considerable extent\nupon how wet you get; but, whether the season be wet or dry, your\npleasure will be regulated largely by the state of harmony existing\nbetween the driver and the bull.\n\nIn these quiet secluded nooks successive generations of Filipinos are\nborn, reared, grow old and die in an even chain of events broken only\nby the occasional erection of a new grass house on the identical spot\nwhere its predecessors have stood for ages. The son lives in the house\nof his father, cultivates the same few square feet of soil planted in\nedible roots, climbs the same cocoanut trees, follows the same winding\npath down to the stream, pounds rice in the same mortar and with the\nsame stick that his ancestors have used from time unremembered, and,\nin case of illness, curls up on a grass mat in a corner of the room\nuntil he dies or by some good fortune recovers. Beyond this narrow\nhorizon he never looks. So narrow and contracted is the life that the\nlanguages of two towns a few miles apart are so different that one\nwould scarcely recognize them as belonging to the same race of people.\n\nSuch are the two extremes of life in our new far Eastern provinces:\nthe one is active, progressive, and cosmopolitan; the other, inactive,\ndecadent, and narrow; but, whether one enjoys the first or endures the\nsecond, there comes to him after leaving a longing to lounge again in\ntropic airs and listen to the lullaby of the winds among the palms.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VII. - THE FILIPINO AT HOME.\n\n\nAs one enters a Filipino sitting-room for the first time, there is one\nfeature in the arrangement of the furniture that impresses itself upon\nhim at once, and it may be stated without fear of serious\ncontradiction that this same peculiar feature in its arrangement will\ncontinue to face him, as he enters different homes, about as certainly\nas he crosses the threshold.\n\nThe arrangement referred to is that of one large mirror, one settee,\nand some ten or a dozen chairs that appear to have had a certain\norderly affection for one another. The mirror is hung upon one of the\nlarge interior parts of the house about four feet above the floor. The\nwooden houses in the Philippines are built by setting large posts\nupright into the ground, extending into the air from twenty to thirty\nfeet. Cross timbers are fastened to these upright posts about eight or\nten feet above the ground and then not sawed off even with the posts,\nbut allowed to extend beyond them each way. The framework of the house\nis built upon these extending cross timbers, a style of building by\nwhich these large upright posts are left standing out on the inside of\nthe room from one to three feet from the walls. It is on that one of\nthese posts most nearly opposite the door that the mirror always finds\nits place. Immediately beneath the mirror is the settee; and the\nchairs are arranged in two parallel lines facing one another and at\nright angles with the ends of the settee. However odd this arrangement\nmay appear to one when he first enters a Filipino drawing-room, there\nare two things to be said in its favor. In the first place, it places\nyou face to face with the person with whom you are conversing so that\nyou can watch him,--a matter of no small moment in the Philippines. In\nthe next place, it enables you to give one of the young ladies a\nsheep's-eye in the mirror while the others present are left where\nMoses was in our much abused conundrum.\n\nThe size of the residence and the quality of its furnishings depends\nupon the wealth of the owner. But there is so vast a difference\nbetween the mode of life of the highest class and the tao, or lowest\nclass, that it is well to speak of them separately, and the great\nmiddle class of Filipinos can easily be imagined to occupy the\nintervening ground.\n\nThe rich Filipino's house is usually of wood built upon a wall of\nstone or brick from ten to fifteen feet high. The floors are kept\nhighly polished in his hallway, dressing-room, and bed-rooms. There\nare, of course, no fire-places in any of the rooms, but on some\noccasions something is needed to dry the rain-soaked atmosphere, for\neven in the dry season it has been seen to rain for five successive\ndays and nights without the cessation of a moment.\n\nA long chain of dependents is attached to the household of the rich\nFilipino. The master has his special body servant to be present at all\ntimes to do his master's bidding, in short, to be the visible\nmechanism of his master's volition. So, too, the lady of the house has\nher servant woman to do the slightest bidding of her ladyship. Then\nthere is the cook who is almost invariably a man, a house boy or two,\nand the coachman. These functionaries, with their assistants and\nassistants to the assistants, together with a servant or two for the\nexclusive service of the children, complete the economic household.\n\nSuch a family has an abundance of rice and wheat bread, also of\nchicken and fish with occasional fresh beef. They have also a good\ndeal of dulce. They regularly serve wine and frequently serve beer\non their tables.\n\nIn strong contrast with this mode of life is that of the tao. His\ndiet consists almost wholly of rice and small uncleaned fish boiled\ntogether. As a rule knife, fork, plate, and spoon find no place in his\nhousehold. The rice and fish are boiled in a pot and then allowed to\ncool in the same vessel or poured out to cool in a large earthen or\nwooden bowl. Then Mr. Tao together with Mrs. Tao and all the young\nTaos squat on their heels around the mixture and satisfy that\nintangible thing called the appetite. They do not use chop sticks as\nthe Chinese do, but the rice and fish are caught in a hollow formed by\nthe first three fingers of the right hand. The thumb is then placed\nbehind the mass. It is raised up and poised before the mouth, with a\nskill coming from the evolution of ages, when a contraction of the\nmuscles of the thumb throws the mass into the mouth with a skill that\nis marvelous to any but a Filipino. To judge from the most reliable\ninformation, the poorest class do not have an abundance of food,\nalthough it would seem that such a condition of things would be\nwell-nigh impossible. However, in a census of one hundred school\nchildren there were found six boys and four girls who declared that\nthey had never had enough to eat, and the native teacher stated that\nthis was probably true.\n\nThe wide gulf between the tao and the rich man is filled by the\ngreat middle class of Filipinos.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VIII. - VISIT TO A LEPER COLONY.\n\n\nNot far from our town was a leper colony and the first Saturday that\ncould be spared was set aside for a trip to the place. It happened\nthat none of the other Americans were at leisure on this particular\nmorning, but, rather then delay the trip or miss it altogether, the\nwriter, armed with a revolver, started out alone.\n\nThe road had been described so accurately by one who was supposed to\nknow it that it was deemed well-nigh impossible to miss the way. The\nmain highway was followed to the point where the by-path supposed to\nlead to the settlement turned off through some bamboo thickets and a\nlow tropical wood. This path led straight away towards the sea-coast\nwhere the houses of the colony were said to stand in a cocoanut grove\nby the beach.\n\nUpon arriving at the settlement, a very inhospitable reception was\nreceived from a mangy cur that growled and showed a very uninviting\nset of sharp, white teeth behind his snarling lips. The growling of\nthe dog had attracted the attention of an old man who, with age-bent\nback, was pounding rice in a mortar about fifty yards away. He turned\nslowly around and, upon seeing an intruder into the primitive quiet of\nthe place, gave a sharp, far-reaching call. The sound had scarcely\nrung through the grove when from about a dozen of the little grass\nhouses dotted here and there fifteen or twenty men armed with bolos\ncame out and gathered around the old man. A sense of my danger flashed\nupon me. Three miles from town and alone in a tropical jungle, I could\nbe almost instantly overcome by this band of bolo-men, and the only\nreport that would ever reach my people would be that I had\n\"disappeared.\" Of course, attack was by no means certain, but the\npotentiality of the situation was thrilling. A drawn revolver and the\ngleaming of its shining barrel had the effect of stopping the men, who\nseemed to be hesitating as to a course of action, until a somewhat\ndignified retreat was made to an open space in the rear from where a\nless dignified and a more hasty retreat began which did not stop short\nof Bacalod.\n\nEnough had been seen, however, even in this short visit, to give\nconvincing proof that the settlement visited was no colony of lepers;\nso, that afternoon two servant boys being taken as guides and\ninterpreters, another attempt was made to reach the goal desired.\n\nThis attempt was successful, and, after about two hours of walking, a\nlittle cluster of grass huts snugly hidden by the sea-coast came into\nview. As we approached, one would have thought it a gala-day. Some few\nchildren, apparently from six to thirteen years of age, almost wholly\nnude, were romping and playing in the open space around which the huts\nstood, and no one would ever have thought that any cloud so horrible\nas leprosy could hover over a place apparently so happy.\n\nBy the side of the path as we passed was a man and his wife setting\nout potato plants. His hands were so puffed and his fingers so short\nthat he could scarcely use them, but he was working along as best he\ncould. His wife's feet were so swollen and twisted that she walked\nonly with the greatest difficulty. We passed them by and entered the\nopen space above referred to.\n\nThe children now saw us, and those of them who could darted away like\nfrightened rabbits, each to his own burrow. An old man who was sitting\nin the warm afternoon sun on the little bamboo platform before his hut\nwas aroused from his lethargic repose by the scampering away of the\nchildren. He arose, trembling upon his tottering limbs, all drawn and\ntwisted, and hobbled away into his hut.\n\nThe children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at\nthe doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of\nthe settlement. In a few moments we were surrounded by a circle of\nhuman beings at once so repulsive and so pitiable that its graphic\nvividness can never be accurately portrayed.\n\nThe old man referred to above, having put on a pair of snow-white\npantaloons, appeared now at the doorway of his hut, followed a few\nmoments later by his wife who had evidently clothed herself in the\nbest raiment she had. At a call from the old man, all the men, women,\nand children in the settlement came out of their huts and stood in a\nline before us. The old man was spokesman and in his native visayan\ntongue made a heart-rending appeal for aid which we were powerless to\ngive. Attention was called to a leper woman, apparently about\ntwenty-five years of age, whose face had been attacked by the disease\nand whose appearance was truly pathetic. Upon her hip was a child\nabout a year and a half old and, strange to say, the child showed as\nyet no signs whatever of the disease.\n\nWhat an indissoluble enigma is life! Here in a little cluster of grass\nhuts in a secluded nook of a secluded island of an all but secluded\narchipelago was gathered together a little community of wretched\nnatives, driven by their loathsomeness from association with others\neven of the same half-savage race. Yet here, men and women loved and\nwere married, by mutual trust if not by law, and children were born of\nthe union to live forever under the unspeakable horror that\novershadowed the unfortunate parents. Love, hatred, sorrow, and\njoy--every passion that enters into the complex structure of the human\nheart even here, in this scene of sadness and despair, was playing\napparently as freely as where misfortune and disease had never crossed\nthe portals of life.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER IX. - A \"HIKE.\"\n\n\nWe were lounging lazily in our hammocks at Jimamaylan one evening in\nApril. Supper was just ended, and the soldiers in the post were\ncollected in groups here and there spinning yarns to pass away the\ntime, when a Filipino clad only in a loin cloth came down the street\nat a steadily swinging run and stopped in front of the sentry. He\nbrought the announcement that a band of ladrones had just burned a\nsugar mill and were advancing to sack a barrio about fifteen miles\naway.\n\nThe invitation of the commanding officer to go on a \"hike\" was eagerly\naccepted, and, in ten minutes after the message was given, the troops\nwere on the march followed by two adventurous pedagogues.\n\nDarkness was just closing in as we left the town, but a resplendent\ntropic moon soon made the night almost as brilliant as the day. The\ntrail we followed led over rough and rocky country. Sometimes for a\ndistance of a mile or more we passed over barren wastes of volcanic\nslag poured out in anger by some peak whose convulsions have long\nsince ceased. Again we would descend into a tropical jungle from the\ndense foliage of which the ladrones could have leaped at any moment,\nhad they known of our coming, and annihilated our little band. We\nforded rapid streams with the water at our breasts, and halted only\nonce in that rapid march of fifteen miles.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the town we met a man who was standing\nguard against a surprise by the ladrones. Nothing could well have been\nmuch more grotesque and nothing could much better illustrate the\nabsolutely primitive condition of the Filipinos in the interior of the\nislands than the appearance of this guard. A pair of knee pants, a\nconical grass hat, and a hemp shirt formed his entire apparel. A long\nflat wooden shield, a bolo, and a long bamboo spear with a sharp,\nflat, iron point, completed his equipment for battle.\n\nHere stood the first and the twentieth centuries side by side. The\nFilipino who had advanced only a stage beyond the condition of\nprimitive man with his knife, spear, and wooden shield, stood side by\nside with the American soldier, a representative of modern life with\nhis magazine rifle, his canteen, his knapsack,--with every article of\nhis clothing made to give him the highest possible efficiency as the\nunit of a military organization.\n\nA few yards farther on we met another guard equipped similarly to the\nfirst. Upon reaching the town, news had just been received that a\ndetachment of troops from another post had intercepted the ladrones\nand fought a skirmish with them. The ladrones had escaped and we set\nout in pursuit of them on a chase wilder than a Quixotic dream. We\nwound our way into the mountains behind the town, inquiring at every\ngrass hut we passed whether the band of ladrones had passed that way,\nbut only once was even a trace of them found. Then it was learned that\nat a certain place they had separated into groups of three or four and\ngone glimmering through the dream of things that were. This place was\nin a secluded nook of the mountains where in years gone by some\nadventurous Spaniard had erected a primitive water mill to grind his\nsugar-cane. We had now marched about twenty miles and the feet of the\npedagogues were a mass of blisters. They had reached the point where\nthat form of military maneuvering called \"hiking\" ceased to possess\nany alluring charms. So a native was persuaded to come out of his lone\nmountain hut and hitch up his carabao and cart. He was then made to\nget on the carabao's back, while the aforesaid pedagogues lay down on\nthe sugar-cane pulp that had been put into the body of the cart, and\nthe driver was instructed to start for the post we had left hours\nbefore, and not to stop until he got there. Being uncertain but that\nsome of the ladrones would learn of our having left the body of troops\nand would try the metal of our steel, we at first agreed that neither\nof us should go to sleep, but it was later decided that probably the\ndriver had no greater desire to cross the Styx than his passengers had\nand that in case of danger he would awaken us, so both took a revolver\nin each hand, stretched out supinely and went to sleep.\n\nSuch a sleep! The rough jolting of the cart over an almost impassable\nroad was never enough to break the spell of slumber. When we awoke the\nblazing tropic sun was past the midday mark of morning, shining full\ninto our unprotected and well-nigh blistered faces.\n\nA pack of dogs were heralding our approach to a little village at the\nfoot of the mountains where ponies were procured to take us back to\nthe post.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he insists, \"have stood the test of ages; and the plant\nevery where retained its name and credit: and one of our good\nherbarists, who had seen a wonderful case of a swoln spleen, so big, and\nhard as to be felt with terror, brought back to a state of nature by it\"\n\n(p. 37). The greatest portion of Hill's concluding section combines\nadvertisement for the powder medicine he was himself manufacturing at a\nhandsome profit together with a protest against competing apothecaries:\n\"An intelligent person was directed to go to the medicinal herb shops in\nthe several markets, and buy some of this Spleen-wort; the name was\nwritten, and shewn to every one; every shop received his money, and\nalmost every one sold a different plant, under the name of this: but\nwhat is very striking, not one of them the right\" (p. 42).\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis did not cease to be printed after Hill's in\n1766, but continued to issue from the presses into the nineteenth\ncentury. A good example of this is the tome by John Reid, physician to\nthe Finsbury Dispensary in London, Essays on Insanity, Hypochondriasis\nand Other Nervous Affections (1816), which summarizes theories of the\nmalady. A bibliographical study of such works would probably reveal\na larger number of titles in the nineteenth century than in the previous\none, but by this time the nature and definition of hypochondria had\nchanged significantly.\n\nIf John Hill's volume is not an important contribution in the history of\nmedicine, it is a lucid and brief exposition of many of the best ideas\nthat had been thought and written on the hyp, with the exception of his\nuninhibited prescribing of herbal medicines as cure-alls. An\nunderstanding of this disease is essential for readers of neoclassical\nEnglish literature, especially when we reflect upon the fact that some\nof the best literature of the period was composed by writers whom it\nafflicted. It is perhaps not without significance that the greatest poet\nof the Augustan age, Alexander Pope, thought it necessary as he lay on\nhis deathbed in May 1744 to exclaim with his last breath, \"I never was\nhippish in my whole life.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. I. - The NATURE of the DISORDER.\n\n\nTo call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and cruel. It\nis a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by thickened\nand distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver, and other\nparts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick scarce knows\none more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\n\nThe blood is a mixture of many fluids, which, in a state of health, are\nso combined, that the whole passes freely through its appointed vessels;\nbut if by the loss of the thinner parts, the rest becomes too gross to\nbe thus carried through, it will stop where the circulation has least\npower; and having thus stopped it will accumulate; heaping by degrees\nobstruction on obstruction.\n\nHealth and chearfulness, and the quiet exercise of mind, depend upon a\nperfect circulation: is it a wonder then, when this becomes impeded the\nbody looses of its health, and the temper of its sprightliness? to be\notherwise would be the miracle; and he inhumanly insults the afflicted,\nwho calls all this a voluntary frowardness. Its slightest state brings\nwith it sickness, anguish and oppression; and innumerable ills follow\nits advancing steps, unless prevented by timely care; till life itself\ngrows burthensome.\n\nThe disease was common in antient Greece; and her physicians understood\nit, better than those perhaps of later times, in any other country; who\nthough happy in many advantages these fathers of the science could not\nhave, yet want the great assistance of frequent watching it in all its\nstages.\n\nThose venerable writers have delivered its nature, and its cure: in the\nfirst every thing now shews they were right; and what they have said as\nto the latter will be found equally true and certain. This, so far as\npresent experience has confirmed it, and no farther, will be here laid\nbefore the afflicted in a few plain words.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. II. - Persons Subject to it.\n\n\nFatigue of mind, and great exertion of its powers often give birth to\nthis disease; and always tend to encrease it. The finer spirits are\nwasted by the labour of the brain: the Philosopher rises from his study\nmore exhausted than the Peasant leaves his drudgery; without the benefit\nthat he has from exercise. Greatness of mind, and steady virtue;\ndetermined resolution, and manly firmness, when put in action, and\nintent upon their object, all also lead to it: perhaps whatever tends to\nthe ennobling of the soul has equal share in bringing on this weakness\nof the body.\n\nFrom this we may learn easily who are the men most subject to it; the\ngrave and studious, those of a sedate temper and enlarged understanding,\nthe learned and wise, the virtuous and the valiant: those whom it were\nthe interest of the world to wish were free from this and every other\nillness; and who perhaps, except for this alloy, would have too large a\nportion of human happiness.\n\nThough these are most, it is not these alone, who are subject to it.\n\nThere are countries where it is endemial, and in other places some have\nthe seeds of it in their constitution; and in some it takes rise from\naccidents. In these last it is the easiest of cure; and in the first\nmost difficult.\n\nBeside the Greeks already named, the Jews of old time were heavily\nafflicted with this disease; and in their descendants to this day it is\noften constitutional: the Spaniards have it almost to a man; and so have\nthe American Indians. Perhaps the character of these several nations may\nbe connected with it. The steady honour, and firm valour of the\nSpaniard, very like that of the ancient Doric nation, who followed the\nflute not the trumpet to the field; and met the enemy, not with shouts\nand fury, but with a determined virtue: it is the temper of the\nHypochondriac to be slow, but unmoveably resolved: the Jew has shewn\nthis mistakenly, but almost miraculously; and the poor Indian, untaught\nas he is, faces all peril with composure, and sings his death-song with\nan unalter'd countenance.\n\nAmong particular persons the most inquiring and contemplative are those\nwho suffer oftenest by this disease; and of all degrees of men I think\nthe clergy. I do not mean the hunting, shooting, drinking clergy, who\nbear the tables of the great; but the retir'd and conscientious; such as\nattend in midnight silence to their duty; and seek in their own cool\nbreasts, or wheresoever else they may be found, new admonitions for an\nage plunged in new vices. To this disease we owe the irreparable loss of\nDr. YOUNG; and the present danger of many other the best and most\nimproved amongst us. May what is here to be proposed assist in their\npreservation!\n\nThe Geometrician or the learned Philosopher of whatever denomination,\nwhose course of study fixes his eye for ever on one object, his mind\nintensely and continually employed upon one thought, should be warned\nalso that he is in danger; or if he find himself already afflicted, he\nshould be told that the same course of life, which brought it on, will,\nwithout due care, encrease it to the most dreaded violence.\n\nThe middle period of life is that in which there is the greatest danger\nof an attack from this disease; and the latter end of autumn, when the\nsummer heats have a little time been over, is the season when in our\nclimate its first assaults are most to be expected. The same time of the\nyear always increases the disorder in those who have been before\nafflicted with it; and it is a truth must be confessed, that from its\nfirst attack the patient grows continually, though slowly, worse; unless\na careful regimen prevent it.\n\nThe constitutions most liable to this obstruction are the lean, and dark\ncomplexioned; the grave and sedentary. Let such watch the first\nsymptoms; and obviate, (as they may with ease) that which it will be\nmuch more difficult to remove.\n\nIt is happy a disease, wherein the patient must do a great deal for\nhimself, falls, for the most part, upon those who have the powers of\nreason strongest. Let them only be aware of this, that the distemper\nnaturally disposes them to inactivity; and reason will have no use\nunless accompanied with resolution to enforce it.\n\nThough the physician can do something toward the cure, much more depends\nupon the patient; and here his constancy of mind will be employed most\nhappily. No one is better qualified to judge on a fair hearing what\ncourse is the most fit; and having made that choice, he must with\npatience wait its good effects. Diseases that come on slowly must have\ntime for curing; an attention to the first appearances of the disorder\nwill be always happiest; because when least established it is easiest\noverthrown: but when that happy period has been neglected, he must wait\nthe effects of such a course as will dilute and melt the obstructing\nmatter gradually; for till that be done it is not only vain, but\nsometimes dangerous, to attempt its expulsion from the body.\n\nThe blood easily separates itself into the grosser and the thinner\nparts: we see this in bleeding; and from the toughness of the red cake\nmay guess how very difficult it will be to dissolve a substance of like\nfirmness in the vessels of the body. That it can thus become thickened\nwithin the body, a Pleurisy shews us too evidently: in that case it is\nbrought on suddenly, and with inflammation; in this other, slowly and\nwithout; and here, even before it forms the obstruction, can bring on\nmany mischiefs. Various causes can produce the same effect, but that in\nall cases operates most durably, which operates most slowly. The watery\npart of the blood is its mild part; in the remaining gross matter of it,\nare acrid salts and burning oils, and these, when destitute of that\nhappy dilution nature gives them in a healthy body, are capable of doing\ngreat mischief to the tender vessels in which they are kept stagnant.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. III. - The SYMPTOMS of the DISORDER.\n\n\nThe first and lightest of the signs that shew this illness are a lowness\nof spirits, and inaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love\nof solitude and a habit of thinking, even on trifling subjects, with too\nmuch steadiness. A very little help may combat these: but if that\nindolence which is indeed a part of the disorder, will neglect them;\nworse must be expected soon to follow.\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness, weight, and oppression in the body,\na want of appetite, or, what is worse, an appetite without digestion;\nfor these are the conditions of different states of the disease, a\nfullness and a difficulty of breathing after meals, a straitness of the\nbreast, pains and flatulencies in the bowels, and an unaptness to\ndischarge their contents.\n\nThe pulse becomes low, weak, and unequal; and there are frequent\npalpitations of the heart, a little dark-coloured urine is voided at\nsome times; and a flood of colourless and insipid at others; relieving\nfor a moment, but increasing the distemper: there is in some cases also\na continual teazing cough, with a choaking stoppage in the throat at\ntimes; then heartburn, sickness, hardness of the belly, and a costive\nhabit, or a tormenting and vain irritation.\n\nThe lips turn pale, the eyes loose their brightness and by degrees the\nwhite grows as it were greenish, the gums want their due firmness, with\ntheir proper colour; and an unpleasing foulness grows upon the teeth:\nthe inside of the mouth is pale and furred, and the throat dry and\nhusky: the colour of the skin is pale (though there are periods when the\nface is florid) and as the obstruction gathers ground, and more affects\nthe liver, the whole body becomes yellow, tawny, greenish, and at length\nof that deep and dusky hue, to which men of swift imagination have given\nthe name of blackness.\n\nThese symptoms do not all appear in any one period of the disease, or in\none case, but at one time or other all of them, as well as those which\nfollow: the flesh becomes cold to the touch, though the patient does not\nhimself perceive it; the limbs grow numbed and torpid, the breathing\ndull and slow, and the voice hollow; and usually the appetite in this\nperiod declines, and comes almost to nothing: night sweats come on,\nblack swellings appear on the veins, the flesh wastes and the breast\nbecomes flat and hollow: the mouth is full of a thin spittle, the head\nis dizzy and confus'd, and sometimes there is an unconquerable numbness\nin the organs of speech.\n\nI have known the temporary silence that follows upon this last symptom\nbecome a jest to the common herd; and the unhappy patient, instead of\ncompassion and assistance, receive the reproof of sullenness, from those\nwho should have known and acted better.\n\nAbout twenty years ago I met on a visit at Catthorpe in Leicestershire a\nyoung gentleman of distinguished learning and abilities, who at certain\ntimes was speechless. The vulgar thought it a pretence: and a jocose\nlady, where he was at tea with company, putting him as she said to a\ntrial, poured out a dish very strong and without sugar. He drank it and\nreturned the cup with a bow of great reserve, and his eye bent on the\nground: she then filled the cup with sugar, and pouring weak tea on it,\nsent it him: he drank that too, looked at her steadily, and blushed for\nher. The lady declared the man was dumb; the rest thought him perverse,\nand obstinate; but a constant and steady perseverance in an easy method\ncured him.\n\nAll these are miseries which the disease, while it retains its natural\nform, can bring upon the patient; and thus he will in time be worn out,\nand led miserably, though slowly, to the grave. Let him not indulge his\ninactivity so far as to give way to this, because it is represented as\nfar off; the disease may suddenly and frightfully change its nature; and\nswifter evils follow.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. IV. - The DANGER.\n\n\nWe have done with the obstruction considered in itself; but this, though\noften unsurmountable by art, at least by the methods now in use, will be\nsometimes broken through at once by nature, or by accidents; and bring\non fatal evils. These are strictly different diseases, and are no\notherway concerned here, than as the consequences of that of which we\nare treating.\n\nThe thick and glutinous blood which has so long stagnated in the spleen,\nwill have in that time altered its nature, and acquired a very great\ndegree of acrimony: while it lies dormant, this does no more mischiefs,\nthan those named already; but when violent exercise, a fit of outrageous\nanger, or any thing else that suddenly shocks and disturbs the frame,\nputs it in motion, it melts at once into a kind of liquid putrefaction.\n\nBeing now thin, it mixes itself readily with the blood again, and brings\non putrid fevers; destroys the substance of the spleen itself, or being\nthrown upon some other of the viscera, corrodes them, and leads on this\nway a swift and miserable death. If it fall upon the liver, its tender\npulpy substance is soon destroyed, jaundices beyond the help of art\nfirst follow, then dropsies and all their train of misery; if on lungs,\nconsumptions; if on the brain, convulsions, epilepsy, palsy, apoplexy;\nif on the surface, leprosy.\n\nThe intention of cure is to melt this coagulation softly, not to break\nit violently; and then to give it a very gentle passage through the\nbowels. There is no safe way for it to take but that; and even that when\nurged too far may bring on fatal dysenteries.\n\nLet none wonder at the sudden devastation which sometimes arises from\nthis long stagnant matter, when liquified too hastily: how long, how\nmany years the impacted matter will continue quiet in a schirrous tumour\nof the breast; but being once put in motion, whether from accident, or\nin the course of nature, what can describe; or what can stop its\nhavock!\n\nInstances of the other are too frequent. A nobleman the other day died\nparalytick: dissection shewed a spleen consumed by an abscess, formed\nfrom the dissolved matter of such an obstruction: and 'tis scarce longer\nsince, a learned gentleman, who had been several years lost to his\nfriends, by the extreams of a Hypochondriacal disorder, seem'd gradually\nwithout assistance to recover: but the lungs suffered while the spleen\nwas freed; and he died very soon of what is called a galloping\nconsumption.\n\nWhen the obstruction is great and of long continuance, if it be thus\nhastily moved, the consequence is, equally, a sudden and a miserable\ndeath, whether, like the matter of a cancer, it remains in its place; or\nlike that of a bad small pox, be thrown upon some other vital part.\n\nLet not the patient be too much alarmed; this is laid down to caution,\nnot to terrify him: it is fit he should know his danger, and attend to\nit; for the prevention is easy; and the cure, even of the most advanced\nstages, when undertaken by gentle means, is not at all impracticable: to\nassist the physician, let him look into himself, and recollect the\nsource of his complaint. This he may judge of from the following\nnotices.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. V. - The Causes of the HYPOCHONDRIASIS.\n\n\nThe obstruction which forms this disease, may take its origin from\ndifferent accidents: a fever ill cured has often caused it; or the\npiles, which had been used to discharge largely, ceasing; a marshy soil,\npoisoned with stagnant water, has given it to some persons; and altho'\nindolence and inactivity are oftenest at the root, yet it has arisen\nfrom too great exercise.\n\nReal grief has often brought it on; and even love, for sometimes that is\nreal. Study and fixed attention of the mind have been accused before;\nand add to these the stooping posture of the body, which most men use,\nthough none should use it, in writing and in reading. This has\ncontributed too much to it; but of all other things night studies are\nthe most destructive. The steady stillness, and dusky habit of all\nnature in those hours, enforce, encourage, and support that settled\ngloom, which rises from fixt thought; and sinks the body to the grave;\neven while it carries up the mind to heaven. He who would have his lamp\n        At midnight hour\n  Be seen in some high lonely tower,\nwill waste the flame of this unheeded life: and while he labours to\nunsphere the spirit of Plato will let loose his own.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VI. - The Cure of the HYPOCHONDRIASIS.\n\n\nLet him who would escape the mischiefs of an obstructed spleen, avoid\nthe things here named: and let him who suffers from the malady,\nendeavour to remember to which of them it has been owing; for half the\nhope depends upon that knowledge.\n\nNature has sometimes made a cure herself, and we should watch her ways;\nfor art never is so right as when it imitates her: sometimes the\npatient's own resolution has set him free. This is always in his power,\nand at all times will do wonders.\n\nThe bleeding of the piles, from nature's single efforts, has at once\ncured a miserable man; where their cessation was the cause of the\ndisorder. A leprosy has appeared upon the skin, and all the symptoms of\nthe former sickness vanished. This among the Jews happened often: both\ndiseases we know were common among them: and I have here seen something\nvery like it: Water-Dock has thrown out scorbutic eruptions, and all the\nformer symptoms of an Hypochondriacal disorder have disappeared:\nreturning indeed when these were unadvisedly struck in; but keeping off\nentirely when they were better treated. A natural purging unsuppressed\nhas sometimes done the same good office: but this is hazardous.\n\nIt is easy to be directed from such instances; only let us take the\nwhole along with us. Bleeding would have answered nature's purpose, if\nshe could not have opened of herself the h\u00e6morrhoidal vessels; but he\nwho should give medicines for that purpose, might destroy his patient by\ntoo great disturbance. If a natural looseness may perform the cure, so\nmay an artificial; when the original source of the disorder points that\nway. But these are helps that take place only in particular cases.\n\nThe general and universal method of cure must be by some mild and gently\nresolving medicine, under the influence of which the obstructing matter\nmay be voided that, or some other way with safety. The best season to\nundertake this is the autumn, but even here there must be caution.\n\nIn the first place, no strong evacuating remedy must be given; for that,\nby carrying off the thinner parts of the juices, will tend to thicken\nthe remainder; and certainly encrease the distemper. No acrid medicine\nmust be directed, for that may act too hastily, dissolve the impacted\nmatter at once, and let it loose, to the destruction of the sufferer; no\nantimonial, no mercurial, no martial preparation must be taken; in\nshort, no chymistry: nature is the shop that heaven has set before us,\nand we must seek our medicine there. The venerable ancients, who knew\nnot this new art, will lead us in the search; and (faithful relators as\nthey are of truth) will tell us whence we may deduce our hope; and what\nwe are to fear.\n\nBut prior to the course of any medicine, and as an essential to any good\nhope from it, the patient must prescribe himself a proper course of\nlife, and a well chosen diet: let us assist him in his choice; and speak\nof this first, as it comes first in order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VI. - Rules of Life for Hypochondriac Persons.\n\n\nAir and exercise, as they are the best preservers of health, and\ngreatest assistants in the cure of all long continued diseases, will\nhave their full effect in this; but there requires some caution in the\nchoice, and management of them. It is common to think the air of high\ngrounds best; but experience near home shews otherwise: the\nHypochondriac patient is always worse at Highgate even than in London.\n\nThe air he breathes should be temperate; not exposed to the utmost\nviolences of heat and cold, and the swift changes from one to the\nother; which are most felt on those high grounds. The side of a hill is\nthe best place for him: and though wet grounds are hurtful; yet let\nthere be the shade of trees, to tempt him often to a walk; and soften by\ntheir exhalation the over dryness of the air.\n\nThe exercise he takes should be frequent; but not violent. Motion\npreserves the firmness of the parts, and elasticity of the vessels; it\nprevents that aggregation of thick humours which he is most to fear. A\nsedentary life always produces weakness, and that mischief always\nfollows: weak eyes are gummy, weak lungs are clogged with phlegm, and\nweak bowels waste themselves in vapid diarrhoeas.\n\nLet him invite himself abroad, and let his friends invite him by every\ninnocent inducement. For me, I should advise above all other things the\nstudy of nature. Let him begin with plants: he will here find a\ncontinual pleasure, and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful\nthings; even of the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to\nwalk; and every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket,\nwill afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually\nin the air, and continually to change the nature and quality of the air,\nby visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the lawn, the\nheath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be abroad; and the\nunceasing variety of the subjects of his observation, will prevent his\nwalking hastily: he will pursue his studies in the air; and that\ncontemplative turn of mind, which in his closet threatened his\ndestruction, will thus become the great means of his recovery.\n\nIf the mind tire upon this, from the repeated use, another of nature's\nkingdoms opens itself at once upon him; the plant he is weary of\nobserving, feeds some insect he may examine; nor is there a stone that\nlies before his foot, but may afford instruction and amusement.\n\nEven what the vulgar call the most abject things will shew a wonderful\nutility; and lead the mind, in pious contemplation higher than the\nstars. The poorest moss that is trampled under foot, has its important\nuses: is it at the bottom of a wood we find it? why there it shelters\nthe fallen seeds; hides them from birds, and covers them from frost;\nand thus becomes the foster father of another forest! creeps it along\nthe surface of a rock? even there its good is infinite! its small roots\nrun into the stone, and the rains make their way after them; the moss\nhaving lived its time dies; it rots and with the mouldered fragments of\nthe stone forms earth; wherein, after a few successions, useful plants\nmay grow, and feed more useful cattle!\n\nIs there a weed more humble in its aspect, more trampled on, or more\ndespised than knot grass! no art can get the better of its growth, no\nlabour can destroy it; 'twere pity if they could, for the thing lives\nwhere nothing would of use to us; and its large and most wonderfully\nabundant seeds, feed in hard winters, half the birds of Heaven.\n\nWhat the weak moss performs upon the rock the loathed toadstool brings\nabout in timber: is an oak dead where man's eye will not find it? this\nfungus roots itself upon the bark, and rots the wood beneath it; hither\nthe beetle creeps for shelter, and for sustenance; him the woodpecker\nfollows as his prey; and while he tears the tree in search of him, he\nscatters it about the ground; which it manures.\n\nNor is it the beetle alone that thus insinuates itself into the\nsubstance of the vegetable tribe: the tender aphide, whom a touch\ndestroys, burrows between the two skins of a leaf, for shelter from his\nwinged enemies; tracing, with more than Dedal\u00e6an art, his various\nmeanders; and veining the green surface with these white lines more\nbeautifully than the best \u00c6gyptian marble.\n\n'Twere endless to proceed; nor is it needful: one object will not fail\nto lead on to another, and every where the goodness of his God will\nshine before him even in what are thought the vilest things; his\ngreatness in the lead of them.\n\nLet him pursue these thoughts, and seek abroad the objects and the\ninstigations to them: but let him in these and all other excursions\navoid equally the dews of early morning, and of evening.\n\nThe more than usual exercise of this prescription will dispose him to\nmore than customary sleep, let him indulge it freely; so far from\nhurting, it will help his cure.\n\nLet him avoid all excesses: drink need scarce be named, for we are\nwriting to men of better and of nobler minds, than can be tempted to\nthat humiliating vice. Those who in this disorder have too great an\nappetite, must not indulge it; much eaten was never well digested: but\nof all excesses the most fatal in this case is that of venery. It is the\nexcess we speak of.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VII. - The proper DIET.\n\n\nIn the first place acids must be avoided carefully; and all things that\nare in a state of fermentation, for they will breed acidity. Provisions\nhardened by salting never should be tasted; much less those cured by\nsmoaking, and by salting. Bacon is indigestible in an Hypochondriac\nstomach; and hams, impregnated as is now the custom, with acid fumes\nfrom the wood fires over which they are hung, have that additional\nmischief.\n\nMilk ought to be a great article in the diet: and even in this there\nshould be choice. The milk of grass-fed cows has its true quality: no\nother. There are a multitude of ways in which this may be made a part\nboth of our foods and drinks, and they should all be used.\n\nThe great and general caution is that the diet be at all times of a kind\nloosening and gently stimulating; light but not acrid. Veal, lamb,\nfowls, lobsters, crabs, craw-fish, fresh water fish and mutton broth,\nwith plenty of boiled vegetables, are always right; and give enough\nvariety.\n\nRaw vegetables are all bad: sour wines, old cheese, and bottled beer are\nthings never to be once tasted. Indeed much wine is wrong, be it of what\nkind soever. It is the first of cordials; and as such I would have it\ntaken in this disease when it is wanted: plainly as a medicine, rather\nthan a part of diet. Malt liquor carefully chosen is certainly the best\ndrink. This must be neither new, nor tending to sourness; perfectly\nclear, and of a moderate strength: it is the native liquor of our\ncountry, and the most healthful.\n\nToo much tea weakens; and even sugar is in this disorder hurtful: but\nhoney may supply its place in most things; and this is not only harmless\nbut medicinal; a very powerful dissolvent of impacted humours, and a\ngreat deobstruent.\n\nWhat wine is drank should be of some of the sweet kinds. Old Hock has\nbeen found on enquiry to yield more than ten times the acid of the sweet\nwines; and in red Port, at least in what we are content to call so,\nthere is an astringent quality, that is most mischievous in these cases:\nit is said there is often alum in it: how pregnant with mischief that\nmust be to persons whose bowels require to be kept open, is most\nevident. Summer fruits perfectly ripe are not only harmless but\nmedicinal; but if eaten unripe they will be very prejudicial. A light\nsupper, which will leave an appetite for a milk breakfast, is always\nright; this will not let the stomach be ravenous for dinner, as it is\napt to be in those who make that their only meal.\n\nOne caution more must be given, and it may seem a strange one: it is\nthat the patient attend regularly to his hours of eating. We have to do\nwith men for the most part whose soul is the great object of their\nregard; but let them not forget they have a body.\n\nThe late Dr. STUKELY has told me, that one day by appointment visiting\nSir ISAAC NEWTON, the servant told him, he was in his study. No one was\npermitted to disturb him there; but as it was near dinner time, the\nvisitor sat down to wait for him. After a time dinner was brought in; a\nboil'd chicken under a cover. An hour pass'd, and Sir ISAAC did not\nappear. The doctor eat the fowl, and covering up the empty dish, bad\nthem dress their master another. Before that was ready, the great man\ncame down; he apologiz'd for his delay, and added, \"give me but leave to\ntake my short dinner, and I shall be at your service; I am fatigued and\nfaint.\" Saying this, he lifted up the cover; and without any emotion,\nturned about to STUKELY with a smile; \"See says he, what we studious\npeople are, I forgot I had din'd.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VIII. - The MEDICINE.\n\n\n'Tis the ill fate of this disease, more than of all others to be\nmisunderstood at first, and thence neglected; till the physician shakes\nhis head at a few first questions. None steals so fatally upon the\nsufferer: its advances are by very slow degrees; but every day it grows\nmore difficult of cure.\n\nThat this obstruction in the spleen is the true malady, the cases\nrelated by the antients, present observation, and the unerring\ntestimonies of dissections leave no room to doubt. Being understood, the\npath is open where to seek a remedy: and our best guides in this, as in\nthe former instance, will be those venerable Greeks; who saw a thousand\nof these cases, where we see one; and with less than half our theory,\ncured twice as many patients.\n\nOne established doctrine holds place in all these writers; that whatever\nby a hasty fermentation dissolves the impacted matter of the\nobstruction, and sends it in that state into the blood, does incredible\nmischief: but that whatever medicine softens it by slow degrees, and, as\nit melts, delivers it to the bowels without disturbance; will cure with\nequal certainty and safety.\n\nFor this good purpose, they knew and tried a multitude of herbs; but in\nthe end they fixed on one: and on their repeated trials of this, they\nbanished all the rest. This stood alone for the cure of the disease; and\nfrom its virtue received the name of SPLEEN-WORT. O wise and happy\nGreeks! authors of knowledge and perpetuators of it! With them the very\nname they gave a plant declared its virtues: with us, a writer calls a\nplant from some friend; that the good gardener who receives the honour,\nmay call another by his name who gave it. We now add the term smooth\nto this herb, to distinguish it from another, called by the same general\nterm, though not much resembling it.\n\nThe virtues of this smooth Spleen-wort have flood the test of ages; and\nthe plant every where retained its name and credit: and one of our good\nherbalists, who had seen a wonderful case of a swoln spleen, so big, and\nhard as to be felt with terror, brought back to a state of nature by it;\nand all the miserable symptoms vanish; thought Spleen-wort not enough\nexpressive of its excellence; but stamp'd on it the name of MILT-WASTE.\n\nIn the Greek Islands now, the use of it is known to every one; and even\nthe lazy monks who take it, are no longer splenetic. In the west of\nEngland, the rocks are stripped of it with diligence; and every old woman\ntells you how charming that leaf is for bookish men: in Russia they use\na plant of this kind in their malt liquor: it came into fashion there\nfor the cure of this disease; which from its constant use is scarce\nknown any longer; and they suppose 'tis added to their liquor for a\nflavour.\n\nThe ancients held it in a kind of veneration; and used what has been\ncalled a superstition in the gathering it. It was to be taken up with a\nsharp knife, without violence, and laid upon the clean linen: no time\nbut the still darkness of the night was proper, and even the moon was\nnot to shine upon it. I know they have been ridiculed for this; for\nnothing is so vain as learned ignorance: but let me be permitted once to\nvindicate them.\n\nThe plant has leaves that can close in their sides; and their under part\nis covered thick with a yellow powder, consisting of the seeds, and seed\nvessels: in these they knew the virtue most resided: this was the golden\ndust they held so valuable; and this they knew they could not be too\ncautious to preserve. They were not ignorant of the sleep of plants; a\nmatter lately spoken of by some, as if a new discovery; and being\nsensible that light, a dry air, an expanded leaf, and a tempestuous\nseason, were the means of losing this fine dust; and knowing also that\ndarkness alone brought on that closing of the leaf which thence has\nbeen called sleep; and which helped to defend and to secure it, they\ntherefore took such time, and used such means as could best preserve the\nplant entire; and even save what might be scattered from it.--And now\nwhere is their superstition?\n\nFrom this plant thus collected they prepared a medicine, which in a\ncourse of forty days scarce ever failed to make a perfect cure.\n\nWe have the plant wild with us; and till the fashion of rough chemical\npreparations took off our attention from these gentler remedies, it was\nin frequent use and great repute. I trust it will be so again: and many\nthank me for restoring it to notice.\n\nSpleen-wort gives out its virtues freely in a tincture; and a small dose\nof this, mixing readily with the blood and juices, gradually dissolves\nthe obstruction; and by a little at a time delivers its contents to be\nthrown off without pain, from the bowels. Let this be done while the\nviscera are yet sound and the cure is perfect. More than the forty days\nof the Greek method is scarce ever required; much oftener two thirds of\nthat time suffice; and every day, from the first dose of it, the patient\nfeels the happy change that is growing in his constitution. His food no\nmore turns putrid on his stomach, but yields its healthful nourishment.\n\nThe swelling after meals therefore vanishes; and with that goes the\nlowness, and anxiety, the difficult breath, and the distracting cholick:\nhe can bear the approach of rainy weather without pain; he finds himself\nmore apt for motion, and ready to take that exercise which is to be\nassistant in his cure; life seems no longer burthensome. His bowels get\ninto the natural condition of health, and perform their office once at\nleast a day; better if a little more: the dull and dead colour of his\nskin goes off, his lips grow red again, and every sign of health\nreturns.\n\nLet him who takes the medicine, say whether any thing here be\nexaggerated. Let him, if he pleases to give himself the trouble, talk\nover with me, or write to me, this gradual decrease of his complaints,\nas he proceeds in his cure. My uncertain state of health does not\npermit me to practise physic in the usual way, but I am very desirous to\ndo what good I can, and shall never refuse my advice, such as it may be,\nto any person rich or poor, in whatever manner he may apply for it. I\nshall refer him to no apothecary, whose bills require he should be\ndrenched with potions; but tell him, in this as in all other cases,\nwhere to find some simple herb; which he may if he please prepare\nhimself; or if he had rather spare that trouble, may have it so prepared\nfrom me.\n\nWith regard to Spleen-wort, no method of using it is more effectual than\nsimply taking it in powder; the only advantage of a tincture, is that a\nproper dose may be given, and yet the stomach not be loaded with so\nlarge a quantity: it is an easier and pleasanter method, and nothing\nmore.\n\nIf any person choose to take it in the other way, I should still wish\nhim once at least to apply to me; that he may be assured what he is\nabout to take is the right plant. Abuses in medicines are at this time\nvery great, and in no instance worse than what relates to herbs. The\nbest of our physicians have complained upon this head with warmth, but\nwithout redress: they know the virtues and the value of many of our\nnative plants, but dread to prescribe them; lest some wrong thing should\nbe administered in their place; perhaps inefficacious, perhaps\nmischievous, nay it may be fatal. The few simple things I direct are\nalways before me; and it will at all times be a pleasure to me, in this\nand any other instance, to see whether what any person is about to take\nbe right. I have great obligations to the public, and this is the best\nreturn that I know how to make.\n\nTo see the need of such a caution, hear a transaction but of yesterday!\n\nAn intelligent person was directed to go to the medicinal herb shops in\nthe several markets, and buy some of this Spleen-wort; the name was\nwritten, and shewn to every one; every shop received his money, and\nalmost every one sold a different plant, under the name of this: but\nwhat is very striking, not one of them the right. Such is the chance of\nhealth in those hands through which the best means of it usually pass;\neven in the most regular course of application.\n\nI would not be understood to limit the little services I may this way be\nable to render the afflicted, to this single instance; much less to\npropose to myself any advantages from it. Whoever pleases will be\nwelcome to me, upon any such occasion; and whatever be the herb on which\nhe places a dependance, he shall be shewn it growing. I once recommended\na garden to be established for this use, at the public expence: one\ngreat person has put it in my power to answer all its purposes.\n\n                        F  I  N  I  S.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris, he was\n\"nominated\" to the Academy. He had but to present an Historical\nPainting in order to take his seat as an Academician.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VENUS AND MARRIAGE\n\n\nBack in his beloved Paris again; thrilled by the atmosphere and gaiety\nof its merry life; in the full vigour of manhood on the eve of his\nthirties; amongst congenial friends; done with the drudgery of winning\nto Academic honour, Boucher saw that the public were not falling over\neach other to purchase religious or historic pictures; he straightway\nturned his back upon these things, and on the edge of his thirtieth\nyear he gave to the world his \"Marriage of the Children of God with\nthe Children of Men,\" in which Venus is the avowed mistress of his\nadoration. It caused a fine stir, and greatly increased his repute.\n\nIn this picture he ends his Italian period and strikes his own\npersonal note. Both this and the \"Venus asking arms for Aeneas from\nVulcan,\" together with the \"Birth of Adonis\" and the \"Death of\nAdonis,\" of about the same period, still show Boucher strongly under\nthe influence of his master, Lemoyne. Indeed, the \"Birth\" and \"Death\nof Adonis,\" their record lost during the scuffle and confusion of the\nRevolution, for long hung side by side as pictures by Lemoyne, until,\nbeing cleaned about 1860, Boucher's initials were discovered upon\nthem, and, contemporary engravings being hunted up, still further\nproved their origin. But in the Venus that now figures in all his\nworks there is that flesh-painting of the nude, and that rosy touch\nupon the flesh of the female figure, that are a far more certain\nsignature of Boucher's handiwork than any written name.\n\nUnfortunately the Salons were closed during Boucher's earlier years\nuntil he was thirty-four, and the record of his work during these\nyears is difficult to follow; but with his service to Venus his\npersonal career begins, and the stream of his Venus-pieces steadily\nflows from his hands.\n\nHe came to her service rid of all prentice essays in craftsmanship, a\nfinished and consummate artist. He found in his subject a goddess to\nwhom he could devote his great and splendid gifts. He painted her\ndainty body with a radiant delight and a rare colour-sense such as\nFrance had never before seen or uttered. He remains to this day the\nfirst painter of the subtle, delicate, and elusive thing that is\nfemininity; he caught her allure, her charm, as he was to catch the\nfragrance and charm of children and flowers; and he set the statement\nof these things upon canvas as they have never been uttered.\n\nThe whole of his life long, Boucher gave himself up with equal and\npassionate devotion to work and to pleasure--working at his easel\noften twelve hours of his day without losing, to the end when the\nbrush fell from his dead fingers, his blitheness of heart or his\ngenerosity of act, and without weakening the pleasure-loving desires\nof his gadding spirit. Out of his splendid toil he made the means to\nindulge his tastes for pleasure; and the gratifying of his tastes in\nturn renewed and created the ideas that made the subjects of his\nartistry. He brought to all he did a joy in the doing that made of his\nvast labour one long pleasure--of his pleasures a riot of industry. He\nplayed as he toiled, scarce knowing which was play and which toil.\n\nThe gossip of his love-affairs makes no romantic story--they were but\ncommonplace ecstasies with unknown frail women. But hard as he worked\nand lived and played, he found time to get himself married in his\nthirtieth year to pretty seventeen-year-old Marie Jeanne Buseau, a\nlittle Parisian--and for love of her, so far as he understood the\nbusiness; for she brought him no dowry.\n\nThe young couple settled down for the next ten years in the Rue\nSaint-Thomas-du-Louvre. Here Boucher lived through his thirties.\n\nMadame was a pretty creature, if we had but Latour's pastel portrait\nalone to prove it. But the pretty features were the crown to as pretty\na body, for she sat often to her lord; and it is clear from his\ncorrespondence with a friend, Bachaumont, that she is the Psyche of\nhis illustrated fable--and Psyche runs much to the Altogether.\n\nMarriage, however, was not likely to imprison Boucher's gadding eyes;\nand it did not. Madame Boucher seems to have had as frail a heart, and\navoided strife by amusing herself, amongst others, with the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who, to gain access to the lady,\ncommissioned Boucher to do the Watteau-like illustrations to\nAcajou--a dull affair. Boucher's pretty wife, herself no mean\nartist, worked in his studio, and painted several smaller canvases\nafter his pictures, gaining some fame as a miniaturist and engraver.\n\nNor did Marriage turn Boucher from his art. Two years were gone by\nsince his nomination to the Academy; he had now to paint the formal\nHistorical Picture and present it in order to take his seat as\nAcademician; and it was in this his thirtieth year that he painted and\nwon his academic rank with the \"Renauld et Armide\" now at the Louvre.\n\nHere he sufficiently subordinated his own style to the academic to\nensure success; and the work was hailed by Academicians and critics,\nincluding Diderot, with enthusiasm. But even here we have his cupids\npeeping round the mythologic event; and Armide herself has pretty\nFrench lips that knew no Greek.\n\nOnce secure of his position, he straightway flung the last remnants of\nthe academic style out of his studio door; and it is a grim comment on\ncriticism that it was just exactly in proportion as he developed his\nown personal genius and uttered the France of his day, that he was\nattacked; whilst the stilted things that he knew were third-rate, and\nwhich he wholly rejected from henceforth, were exactly the things that\nwere praised!\n\nHis election to the Academy, and the enthusiasm over the picture that\nwon him his seat thereat, brought his name before the young king; the\nfollowing year he received his first order from the Court whose\npainter he was destined to become. The decorations in the queen's\napartments were gloomy and had grown black; and he painted in their\nstead the \"Charity,\" \"Abundance,\" \"Fidelity,\" and \"Prudence\" still\nthere to be seen. Indeed, with his gay vision, his pretty habit of\nculling only the flowers from the garden of life, and his quickness to\nset down the pleasing thing in every prospect, Boucher was the\ndestined painter of a Court weary of pomposity and the pose of the\nmock-heroic, and which was wholly giving itself up to pleasure and the\nelegances.\n\nBut neither his new dignity of Academician nor the royal favour, kept\nhim from the bookshops; and he illustrated, with rare beauty and a\ncharm worthy of Watteau, the great edition of the Works of Moli\u00e8re\nin his thirty-first year. It is true that he made as free with\nMoli\u00e8re's world as with the Gods of Olympus; he peoples the plays with\ncharacters of his own day, arrayed in the dress and habit of that day,\nand moving in surroundings that he saw about him.\n\n\nLE MONDE QUI S'AMUSE\n\n\nThe Homely had come upon the town out of Holland, painted with most\nconsummate artistry by Chardin, and was soon in the vogue. Boucher had\na quick eye for the mode. And he straightway set himself to the\npainting of \"La Belle Cuisini\u00e8re.\" Still-life and homely subjects need\nan accuracy of realism and a Dutch sense of these things, a sense of\nsincerity and an appreciation of the dignity of the work-a-day life of\nthe people, in which Boucher was wholly lacking. Above all, it calls\nfor a sense of \"character,\" which, in Boucher, was always weak. It was\na sneer against him that his very broomsticks called for pompons and\nribbons--and there was more than a little truth in the spite. He is\nmore concerned with the accident of the kissing of a kitchen-maid than\nwith the kitchen's habit. He cannot even peep into a scullery without\ndragging in Venus by the skirts, and tricking her out in a\nproperty-wardrobe of a scullery-wench, in which the girl is clearly\nbut acting the part.\n\nHowever, these passing vogues and experiments in different methods\nwere only gay asides--he was working the while upon his own subjects;\nand, to the display by its several members ordered by the Academy, he\nsent four little paintings of fauns and cupids which won him the\nhonour of election as deputy-professor. His brain and hand were very\nbusy, and he turns from one thing to another with amazing facility,\nbringing distinction to all that he does.\n\nBut he painted about this time two pictures of infants, \"L'Amour\nOiseleur\" and \"L'Amour Moissonneur,\" which were the beginning of that\nhost of cupids that he let fly from his studio; they frolic across his\ncanvases and join the retinue of Venus, peeping out from clouds, over\nwaves, round curtains, painted with a perfection that has never been\nsurpassed in the portrayal of infants. He painted their round limbs,\ntheir lusty life, their delightful awkwardnesses, their jolly fat\ngrace, their na\u00efve surprise at life and glory in it, as they had never\nbeen painted before, and have never been painted since.\n\nHe also gave forth in this his thirty-third year a \"Pastoral\" and a\n\"Shepherd and Shepherdess in Conversation,\" with sheep about them and\nin a pleasant landscape, which were his first essays in the style that\nhe created and which made him famous.\n\nHis friend Meissonnier, the inventor of the rococo, stood godfather to\nBoucher's first-born son in the May of 1736.\n\nFrom the very beginning Boucher seems to have been engraved. And these\nengravings, done by the best gravers of his day, greatly extended his\nreputation and popularised him; he fully realised the value of the\nadvertisement as well as his profits from it. Before his thirty-third\nyear was run out he published his well-known \"Cries of Paris.\"\n\nBoucher's description of them, \"studies from the low classes,\" holds\nthe key to that something of failure to realise the dramatic verities\nthat is over all; it gives also the attitude of the France that he\nknew towards the France that he did not, and could not understand. He\ncreated that dainty, pleasant atmosphere that comes floating up to the\nwindows on a fresh morning in Paris from the musical cries of\nthe street vendors; but of the deeper significance of the\nstreet-sellers--of the miserable accent in their life, of their weary\ntoil, of the dignity of their labour--he knew nothing; his brush could\nnot refrain from making elegance and fine manners peep from behind the\nstreet-porter's fustian or the milkmaid's skirt.\n\nBut his thirty-third year was to contain a more far-reaching\nsignificance even than the creation of his cupid-pieces and pastorals.\n\nThe \"Cries of Paris\" were scarce printed when Boucher's illustration\nto \"Don Quixote\" appeared--\"Sancho pursued by the servants of the\nDuke.\" This design was to have far-reaching results that Boucher\nlittle suspected.\n\nThe painter Oudry had been called to the conduct of the great tapestry\nlooms at Beauvais a couple of years before; and in his efforts to\nfurnish the looms with good designs, he now called Boucher to his aid,\nwhose original and fresh style, colour, and arrangement, together with\nhis personal vision, and the enthusiasm and zeal with which he threw\nhimself into the work, at once increased the reputation and the\nproducts of the famous looms. This large designing for the tapestries\nwas, in return, of immense value to the development of the genius of\nthe man, enlarging his breadth of style and giving scope to that great\ndecorative sense that was his superb gift. Thenceforth he was destined\nto play a supreme part in the history of the world-famed factories. He\nnow produced painting after painting for the Beauvais looms.\n\nLife is now one long triumph for Boucher, only disturbed in this year\nby the sad news of the suicide of his old master, Lemoyne. It was in\nthis, Boucher's thirty-fourth year, that the Salon was opened for the\nfirst time since Boucher's infancy, and he contributed several\ncanvases to it.\n\nRigaud, the old Academician, now close upon eighty, straggling through\nthe great galleries, might well blink and gasp at the change that had\ncome over French art since he last exhibited there, thirty-three years\ngone by; but his scoffs and regrets held no terrors for the younger\nAcademicians gathered about. He stood in a new world. A new generation\nwas in possession. The grand manner, the severe etiquette, formal\nmock-heroics, and solemn pomposity of Louis the Fourteenth were\nvanished, and the Agreeable and the Pleasant Make-Believe of Louis the\nFifteenth reigned in their stead. Old Rigaud might blink indeed! Just\nas the imposing and stilted etiquette of the reception-room had given\nplace to the easy manners and airy etiquette of the dainty boudoir, so\nhad light chatter and gay wit and the quick repartee usurped the heavy\nsplendours of a consequential age. France, weary of an eternal pose of\nthe grand manner, was seeking change in joyousness and amusement.\n\nGallantry and gaiety were become the object of the ambition of a\ndandified and elegant day. France became a coquette; dressed herself\nas a porcelain shepherdess; and with beribboned crook and sheep,\nseeking pleasant prospects to stroll through, gave herself to\ndalliance--her powder-puff and patch-box and fan a serious part of her\nunseriousness.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE CH\u00c2TEAUROUX\n\n\nAt thirty-five Boucher has arrived. He is in the vogue; in favour at\nCourt--as well as in the fashion. In his three years from taking his\nseat at the Academy to the opening of the first Salon he has created a\nnew and original style--his cupid pieces, his pastorals, his\nVenus-pieces, his tapestry. Boucher's kingdom lay in the realm of the\ndecorative painter--and he has found it. Torn from the surroundings\nfor which he designed them, as part and parcel of the general scheme,\nhis pictures are as out of place as an Italian altarpiece in an\nEnglish dining-room, yet they suffer less. Several may still be seen,\nas he set them up in frames of his own planning, as overdoors in the\npalace of the Soubise, now given up to the national archives.\n\nThe ghost of the Prince of Soubise, who commissioned them, may haunt\nhis palace, but his kin know the place no longer. The overdoors\nwrought by Boucher's skill look down now on the nation's collection of\nhistoric documents. The \"Three Graces enchaining Love,\" the fine\npastoral of \"The Cage,\" and the pastoral of the \"Shepherd placing a\nRose in his Shepherdess's Hair,\" were to see a mightier change than\nthe usurpation of Louis the Fourteenth's pompous age by the elegant\nyears of Louis the Fifteenth. But this was not as yet. Here at least\nwe see Boucher's art rid of all outside influences, and at the full\ntide of creation; here we have the inimitable lightness of touch, the\nfigures and landscape bathed in the airy volume of atmosphere.\n\nHe seems at this time to have played with pastel, due probably to his\nfriendship with Latour, who sent a portrait of Boucher's wife to this\nSalon. Boucher showed in the use of chalks the artistry and skill that\nwere always at his command.\n\nHe also was putting to its full use his innate sense of landscape,\nraising to high achievement that astonishing balance of landscape and\nfigures in his design--a balance that has never been surpassed; his\nfigures never override his landscape; his landscape never overpowers\nhis figures. His earnest counsels to his pupils and his constant\ndeploring of the lack of the landscape art in France prove the great\nstress he laid upon it.\n\nThe designing of a frontispiece for the catalogue of a personal\nfriend, one Gersaint, a merchant of oriental wares, started Boucher in\nhis thirty-third year upon that series of Chinese pictures and\ntapestries known as the \"Chinoiseries,\" in which he frittered away\nonly too many precious hours, for they were received with great favour\nby the public. The paintings of Chinese subjects designed for the\nlooms of Beauvais are still to be seen at Besan\u00e7on.\n\nBut busy as were his brain and hand in the exercise of his wide and\nversatile gifts, pouring out \"Chinoiseries,\" illustrations for books,\ntapestries on a large scale, landscapes, models for the gilt bronze\ndecorations of porcelain vases, scheming handsome frames for his\npictures, designing furniture and fans--Boucher was true, above all,\n\"to his goddess,\" and painted the famed \"Birth of Venus,\" which,\nthanks to the Swedish Ambassador's fondness for Madame Boucher, now\nhangs at Stockholm; our amorous Count de Tessin, to be just, seems to\nhave had a rare flair for the artistic--besides artist's wives. It was\non the 15th of April in 1742, the last year of his thirties, that the\nRoyal favour was marked by the grant of a pension of 400 livres\n(double florins) to Boucher with promise of early benefits to follow.\n\nTwo years afterwards it was raised to 600 livres.\n\nThis was the year that he painted the beautiful canvas of \"Diana\nleaving the Bath with one of her Companions,\" now at the Louvre. It\nwas also the year that saw his landscape, the \"Hamlet of Iss\u00e9\" at the\nSalon. This \"Hameau d'Iss\u00e9\" was to be enlarged for the Opera, proving\nhim to be decorator there, where he was arranging waterfalls,\ncascades, and the rest of the pretty business, without staying his\nhand from his art.\n\nAt forty Boucher has come into his kingdom. The ten years of these\nforties were to be a vast triumph for him. He was to produce\nmasterpiece after masterpiece. His art had caught the taste of the\nday. He was at the height of his powers. He had done great things--he\nwas to do greater. During these ten years of his forties he poured\nforth vivid and glowing works of sustained power and originality.\n\nWe have a picture of him as he was in the flesh at this time--the\npastel portrait by Lundberg, now at the Louvre--a gay, somewhat\ndissipated, handsomely dressed dandy of the time, smiling out of his\ncareless day, the debonnair man of fashion, the laughing eyes showing\nsigns of the night carousals, which were the rest from the prodigious\ntoil of this vital and forthright spirit.\n\nIt was in this our artist's fortieth year that the gifted old Cardinal\nFleury, who had guided the fortunes of France with rare skill, died,\nbroken by his ninety years and the blunders of the disastrous war that\nhe had so strenuously opposed; and Louis, essaying the strut of\nkingship, became king by act. His indolent character, unequal to the\nmighty business, his indeterminate will fretted by the set of\nquarrelling and intriguing rogues that he gathered about him as his\nministers, he fell into the habit that became his thenceforth, the\nonly thing to which he paid the tribute of constancy--he ruled France\nfrom behind pretty petticoats. He had early shown the adulterous blood\nof his great-grandfather; two, if not three, of five sisters of the\nnoble and historic house of De Nesle had yielded to his gadding fancy;\nthe youngest now ousted her sister De Mailly from the king's favour,\nwas publicly acknowledged as the king's mistress, and became Duchess\nof Ch\u00e2teauroux. Boucher painted her handsome being as a shepherdess in\none of his pastorals. She was no ordinary toy of a king. A woman of\ntalent, with hot ambitions for the king's majesty, fired with the\npride of race of the old French noblesse, it was during her short\nyears of ascendancy over the king that he roused from his body's\ntorpor and made an effort to reach the dignity and eminence befitting\nto the lord of a great and gallant people. He stepped forth awhile\nfrom his drunken bouts and manifold mean adulteries, and set himself\nat the head of the army in Flanders, and strutted it as conqueror.\n\nPoor Ch\u00e2teauroux only got the hate of the people for reward, Louis the\nhonours; for the people resented the public dishonour of her state.\n\nPower she found to be a dead-sea apple in her pretty mouth. The glory\nof it all, the splendours, were not the easily won delights for which\nshe had looked. She had to fight a duel, that never ended, with the\nking's witty, crafty, and scurrilous Prime Minister, the notorious\nMaurepas--and Maurepas willed that no woman should ever come between\nhim and the king--Maurepas who knew no mercy, no decency, no chivalry,\nno scruple. At Ch\u00e2teauroux's urging, Louis placed himself at the\nhead of the army; and France went near mad with joy that she had\nagain found a king. Crafty Maurepas urged on the business; the\nCh\u00e2teauroux suddenly realised his cunning glee--it separated her from\nthe king.\n\nOut of the whirl of things Boucher's fortune was ripening, little as\nhe might suspect it.\n\nHe was painting masterpieces that make his name live. To his fortieth\nyear belong the famed \"Birth of Venus,\" the \"Venus leaving the Bath,\"\nthe \"Muse Clio,\" the \"Muse Melpomene,\" and the three well-known\npastorals now at the Louvre--\"The Sleeping Shepherdess,\" the \"Nest,\"\n\n\nand the \"Shepherd and Shepherdesses.\" Of the many famous Venus-pieces\nthat his hand painted during these years it is not easy to write the\nlist. But having signed the \"Marriage of Love and Psyche\" at\nforty-one, he turned his experimental hand to the homely, realistic\nDutch style that was having a wide vogue, and painted the\n\"Dejeuner\"--a family of the prosperous class of the day at\nbreakfast--showing with rare charm the surroundings and home life of\nthe well-to-do of his time.\n\nAll goes well with Boucher. He changes into better quarters in the Rue\nde Grenelle-Saint-Honor\u00e9, where he lived for the next five years,\nuntil 1749; but his eyes are fixed upon a studio and apartments at\nthe old palace of the Louvre, though the hard intriguing of his\npowerful friends at Court on his behalf failed for some time. He had,\nindeed, to make another move before he arrived at his longed-for goal.\n\nPensions Boucher, like others, had found to be somewhat empty affairs;\nbut rooms at the Louvre were a solid possession eagerly sought after\nby the artists.\n\nIn this year of 1744 Boucher created a new fashion at the annual Salon\nby sending studies and sketches instead of finished pictures; and it\nset a value upon such things not before realised by artists, for\nsuccess was instant and loud.\n\nTowards the end of the next, Boucher's forty-second year, the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who was to take his leave of Paris,\ncommissioned four pictures to represent the day of a woman of fashion,\nand to be entitled \"Morning,\" \"Midday,\" \"Evening,\" and \"Night.\"\n\nBoucher painted one of these for him, now known as the \"Marchande de\nModes.\" The others were painted later, and all had a wide vogue as\nengravings. The correspondence has interest since it reveals Boucher's\nbusiness habits; he was paid for a picture on its delivery, and for\neach of these he was to receive 600 livres (double florins or\ndollars)--about a hundred and twenty pounds.\n\nIn an official document of the Director of Buildings to the king (or\nMinister of Fine Art, as we should say), written in this year of 1745,\nBoucher being forty-two, is a \"list of the best painters,\" in which\nBoucher is singled out for distinction as \"an historic painter, living\nin the Rue de Grenelle-Saint-Honor\u00e9, opposite the Rue des Deux-Ecus,\npupil of Lemoyne, excelling also in landscape, grotesques, and\nornaments in the manner of Watteau; and equally skilled in painting\nflowers, fruit, architecture, and subjects of gallantry and of\nfashion.\"\n\nNot so bad for dry officialdom; the critics could learn a lesson. For\nhe was nothing less. What indeed does he not do? and wondrous well!\nthis painter of the age.\n\nAnd the mighty rush of events is about to sweep him into further\nprominence; the very things which he probably passed by with a gay\nshrug are to enrich him, to help him to his highest fulfilment.\n\nPoor Ch\u00e2teauroux saw that she must lose the king's gadding favour in\nthe conflict with Maurepas unless she joined her lord, now with the\narmy. She realised full well that she had created the new Louis of\nAmbition--that her going must bring the people's hate to her. But she\ndared not lose the king. And she went. Maurepas had overdone his\njibings. The indiscretion at once rang through the land; became the\njest of the army--and Maurepas was not far from the bottom of the\nbusiness. The discreet indiscretion of covered ways between the king's\nlodgings and hers only added to the mockeries, and increased the\npeople's hate against, of course, the Ch\u00e2teauroux. Then upon a day in\nAugust the small-pox seized Louis at Metz; poor Ch\u00e2teauroux fought for\npossession of the king in the sick room, until his fear of\ndeath--Louis' sole piety--sent her packing--shrinking back in the\nhired carriage at each halting-place for change of horses, lest she\nshould be seen and torn from her place and destroyed by the populace.\n\nBut Louis recovered; Paris rang with bells at joy on his recovery, and\nhe entered the city amidst mad enthusiasm, hailed as The Well-Beloved.\n\nHe sent for the Ch\u00e2teauroux to find her dying, Maurepas having to\ndeliver the message of recall. She died suddenly and in great agony,\nswearing that Maurepas had poisoned her--died in the arms of her poor\ndiscarded sister, the De Mailly.\n\nBut this year of 1745 Boucher hears a mightier scandal that is to mean\nvast things to all France--and not least of all to Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE POMPADOUR\n\n\nA young bride had become the gossip of the rich merchant society of\nParis--that class that was ousting the old noblesse from power. She\nwas a beautiful, a remarkable woman; her wit was repeated in the\ndrawing-rooms, she had all the accomplishments; her charming\nname--Madame Lenormant d'Etioles.\n\nDraw aside the curtains of the past and we discover our little Jeanne\nPoisson--grown into this exquisite creature. It has come about in\nstrange fashion enough. The father--a scandalous fellow--having\nfingered the commissariat moneys in ugly ways to his own use, had been\nbanished for the ugly business. Nor is Jeanne's mother any better than\nshe should be; and the wags wink knowingly at the handsome and rich\nman of fashion, Monsieur Lenormant de Tournehem, who has been the\nfavoured gallant during the absence of the light-fingered Poisson.\n\nAnd, of a truth, Lenormant de Tournehem takes astonishing interest in\nthe little Jeanne--watching over her up-growing and giving her the\nbest of education at the convent, where she wins all hearts, and is\nknown as \"the little queen.\" The truth spoken with wondrous prophecy,\nif unthinkingly, as we shall see. Complacent Poisson came home, and\ntook the rich and fashionable, bland and smiling Lenormant de\nTournehem to his arms. Has he not wealth and estates? therefore as\nexcellent a friend for Poisson as for Madame Poisson. The girl Jeanne\nleaves the convent to be taught the accomplishments by the supreme\nmasters of France, the wits foregather at Madame Poisson's, and the\nbrilliant Jeanne is soon mistress of the arts--coquetry not least of\nall; has also the most exquisite taste in dress. Under all is a heart\ncold as steel; calculating as the higher mathematics. She has but one\nhindrance to ambition--her mean birth. Lenormant de Tournehem rids her\neven of this slur by making his nephew, Lenormant d'Etioles, marry\nher, giving the young couple half his fortune for dowry, and the\npromise of the rest when he dies--also he grants him a splendid\ntown-house, as splendid a country seat. And consequential\nself-respecting little Lenormant d'Etioles is lord of Etioles, amongst\nother seignories. So Jane Fish appears as Madame Lenormant d'Etioles,\nseductive, beautiful, accomplished, to whose house repair the new\nphilosophy, the wits, and artists. She has a certain sense of virtue;\nindeed openly vows that no one but the king shall ever come between\nher and her lord. But, deep in her heart, she has harboured a fierce\nambition--that the king shall help her to keep her bond. She puts\nforth all her gifts, all her powers, to win to the strange goal;\nconfides it to her worldly mother and \"uncle,\" Lenormant de Tournehem;\nfinds keen allies therein to the reaching of that strange goal. The\ndeath of the Ch\u00e2teauroux clears the way. At a masked ball the king is\nintrigued as to the personality of a beautiful woman who plagues him\nwith her art; he orders the unmasking. Madame Lenormant d'Etioles\nstands revealed, drops her handkerchief as by accident; the whisper\nruns through the Court that \"the handkerchief has been thrown!\" The\nking stoops and picks it up. A few evenings later she is smuggled into\nthe \"private apartments.\" She goes again a month later; in the morning\nis seized with sudden terror--she daren't go back to her angry lord\nlest he do her grievous harm; he will have missed her. The king is\ntouched; allows her to hide from henceforth in the secret apartments;\npromises the beautiful creature a lodging, her husband's banishment,\nand early acknowledgment as titular mistress--before the whole Court\nat Easter, says the pious Great One. But he has to join the army to\nplay the Conqueror at Fontenoy; and it is later in the year\n(September) before Madame d'Etioles is presented to the Court in a\nvast company and proceeds to the queen's apartments to kiss hands on\nappointment. Thus was Jeanne Poisson raised to the great aristocracy\nof France in her twenty-third year as Marquise de Pompadour.\n\nBoucher had been one of the brilliant group of artists of the\nd'Etioles' circle. That the Pompadour's influence had much effect upon\nhis position at Court for a year or two is unlikely; for she had to\nfight for possession of the king day and night, as the Ch\u00e2teauroux\nhad done, against the queen's party and the unscrupulous enmity of\nMaurepas. To set down Boucher's favour at Court to her is ridiculous.\n\nHe was painting for the queen's apartments at thirty-one when the\nPompadour was a school-girl of twelve. But in the year following her\nrise to power, Boucher painted four pictures for the large room of the\nDauphin, which were \"placed elsewhere\"; and, the year after that, he\nwas at work upon two pictures for the bedroom of the king at the\ncastle of Marly. It is likely enough that the Pompadour directed this\norder. She had almost immediately secured the office of the\nDirector-General of Buildings, which covered the direction of the\nroyal art treasures, for \"uncle\" Lenormant de Tournehem, who was also\na friend of the artist. And from this year it is significant that\nBoucher paints no more for the opposing camp of the Queen and Dauphin.\n\nHe was now giving all his strength to the \"Rape of Europa\" that he\npainted for the competition ordered by the Academy at the command of\nLenormant de Tournehem in the king's name, in which ten chosen\nAcademicians were to paint subjects in their own style for six prizes\nand a gold medal, to be awarded in secret vote by the competing\nartists themselves. Boucher won, by his amiable nature, the good-will\nof them all by proposing that they should so arrange as to share the\nprizes equally, and thus prevent any sense of soreness inevitable in\nthe losers.\n\nBut greatly as he won the good-fellowship of his fellow-artists by it,\nthis picture caused a murmur to rise amongst the critics who,\naforetime loud in his praise, now began to complain of his \"abuse of\nrose tints\" in the painting of the female nude. The fact was that\nDiderot and the men of the New Philosophy were turning their eyes to\nthe whole foundations upon which France was built, art as well as\nsociety, and were beginning to demand of art \"grandeur and morality in\nits subjects.\" They were soon to be clamouring for \"the statement of a\ngreat maxim, a lesson for the spectator.\" Diderot, with bull-like\ncourage, picked out the greatest, and turned upon Boucher, blaming him\nfor triviality.\n\nThe nations, weary of war, concluded the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in\nthe October of 1748. No sooner was peace concluded than Louis\nrelapsed into his old habit of dandified indolence and profligate\nease; and, putting from him his duties as the lord of a great people,\nhe gave himself up to shameless intrigues. He allowed the Pompadour to\nusurp his magnificence and to rule over the land. He yielded himself\nutterly, if sometimes sulkily, to her domination; and for sixteen\nyears she was the most powerful person at Court, the greatest force in\nthe state--making and unmaking ministers, disposing of office,\nhonours, titles, pensions. All political affairs were discussed and\narranged under her guidance; ministers, ambassadors, generals\ntransacted their business in her stately boudoirs; the whole patronage\nof the sovereign was dispensed by her pretty hands; the prizes of the\nChurch, of the army, of the magistracy could be obtained solely\nthrough her favour and good-will. Her energy must have been\nprodigious. Possessed of extraordinary talents and exquisite tastes,\nshe gave full rein to them, and it was in the indulgence of her better\nqualities that Destiny brought Boucher into the friendship of this\nwonderful woman. She became not only his patron but his pupil,\nengraving several of his designs.\n\nBut this, her sovereignty over the king, easy and light in its outward\nseeming, was a haggard nightmare to the calculating woman who had so\nlonged for it. She knew no single hour's rest from the night she won\nto the king's bed. She had to fight her enemies, secret and open, for\npossession of the king's will, day and night; and she fought--with\nrare courage. She won by consummate skill and unending pluck. She made\nherself an essential part of the king's freedom from care. The Court\nparty fought her for power with constant vigilance. Maurepas brought\nall his unscrupulous art, all his ironic mimicry, all his vile jibes\nand unchivalrous hatred to bear against her. He had made himself a\nnecessity to the king; and he never slept away a chance of injuring\nher. He knew no mercy, no nobility, no pity. He made her the detested\nobject of the people. With his own hands he penned the witty verses\nand epigrams that were sung and flung about the streets of Paris.\n\nBut she had an enemy more subtle than any at the Court--hour by hour\nshe had to dispute the king with the king's boredom. And it was in the\neffort to do so that she created her celebrated theatre in the\nprivate apartments, calling Boucher and others to her aid in the doing\nof it. Here the noblest of France vied with each other to obtain the\nsmallest part to play, an instrument in its orchestra, an invitation\nto its performances.\n\nBoucher left the Opera to become its decorator in 1748, and did not\nreturn until her death. For her, he also decorated her beautiful rooms\nat Bellevue. She bought at high prices many of his greatest\nmasterpieces.\n\nThe Pompadour's power so greatly increased that she openly took\ncommand of the king's will; dared and succeeded in getting his\nfavourite Maurepas banished; and herself took to the use of the kingly\n\"we.\" Her rascally father was created Lord of Marigny; her brother,\nwhom the king liked well and called \"little brother,\" was created\nMarquis de Vandi\u00e8res; her only child, Alexandrine, signed her name as\na princess of the blood royal, and would have been married to the\nblood royal had she not caught the small-pox and died. She amassed a\nprivate fortune, castles, and estates such as no mistress had dreamed\nof; and into them she poured art treasures that cost the nation\nthirty-six millions of money. She created the porcelain factory of\nS\u00e8vres, kept keen watch over the Gobelins looms, and founded the great\nMilitary School of St. Cyr amidst work that would have kept several\nstatesmen busy, and of deadly intrigues at Court that would have\nbroken the spirit of many a brilliant man.\n\nIt was in her hectic desire to keep the king from being bored that she\nstooped, and made Boucher stoop, to the employment of his high\nartistry in the painting of a series of indecent pictures wherewith to\ntickle the jaded desires of Boredom, and thereby gave rise to the\nwidespread impression that Boucher's art was ever infected by base\ndesign. But Boucher was, at his very worst, but a healthy animal; and\neven in these secret works for the king he did not reach so low as did\nmany an artist of more pious memory who painted with no excuse but his\nown pleasure.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the Pompadour has been blamed too much for this\nevil act, and too much forgotten for her splendid patronage of the man\nwho, under it and during these great years of his forties, produced a\nseries of masterpieces that place him in the foremost rank of the\npainters of his century. It is impossible to reckon the number of the\npastorals and Venus-pieces that his master-hand painted and loved to\npaint, during these the supreme years of his genius. It is significant\nthat they were painted during the years that saw the Pompadour in\nsupreme power.\n\nBoucher was so firmly established in 1750, his forty-seventh year,\nthat he moved into a new house in the Rue Richelieu, near the Palais\nRoyal. Disappointed in not receiving a studio and apartments at the\nLouvre, he was allowed to use a studio in the king's library. He was\nnow making money so easily that he was able to collect pictures and\nprecious stones and the gaily coloured curiosities that appealed to\nhis tastes.\n\nThe critics were becoming more and more censorious; and one of them\nhits true with the comment that in his pastorals his shepherdesses\nlook as if they had stepped over from the Opera and would soon be off\nagain thereto.\n\nIn his forty-eighth year Boucher's art was at its most luminous\nstage--his atmosphere clear and subtle and exquisitely rendered; his\nyellows golden; his whites satin-like and silvery; his flesh-tones\nupon the nude bodies of his goddesses unsurpassed by previous art. The\nbeauty of it all was not to last much longer.\n\nLenormant de Tournehem died suddenly in the November of 1751; the\nPompadour's brother, Abel Poisson de Vandi\u00e8res, was appointed\nDirector-General in his stead at the age of twenty-five--and soon\nafterwards, on the death of his father, created Marquis de Marigny--a\nshy, handsome youth, a gentleman and an honourable fellow, whom the\nking liked well, and against whom his sister's sole complaint was that\nhe lacked the brazen effrontery of the courtiers of the day. No man\ndid more for the advancement of the art of his time. A pension of a\nthousand livres falling vacant, the young fellow secured it for\nBoucher; and almost immediately afterwards, a studio becoming vacant\nat the Louvre owing to the death of Coypel, first painter to the king,\nBoucher came to his coveted home, eagerly moving in with his family as\nsoon as its wretched state could be put into repair.\n\nThe decoration of the new wing to the palace at Fontainebleau brought\nthe commission for the painting of the ceiling and the principal\npicture in the Council Chamber to Boucher, who had already decorated\nthe Dining-Room. This was the period of his painting the \"Rising\" and\nthe \"Setting of the Sun\" for the Pompadour, now in the Watteau\ncollection, two canvases that were always favourites with the painter,\nbitterly as they were assailed by the critic Grimm.\n\nHe was turning out so much work that it was impossible to give as much\ncare to his pictures as he ought. For he refused sternly, his life\nlong, to raise his prices; by consequence he had to create a larger\namount of work in order to meet his expenditure. It was about this\ntime that Reynolds, passing through Paris, went to visit him and found\nhim painting on a huge canvas without models or sketches. \"On\nexpressing my surprise,\" writes Reynolds, \"he replied that he had\nconsidered the model as necessary during his youth until he had\ncompleted his study of art, but that he had not used one for a long\ntime past.\"\n\nHe soon had not the time, not only to paint from nature but even to\ngive his pictures the work necessary to complete them. The feverish\nhaste which took possession of him in his frantic endeavour to meet\nthe vast demand for his pictures, and the eager efforts of his\nengravers to satisfy the public call for engravings after his works,\ngave him less and less leisure to joy in their doing. And his eyesight\nbegan to fail. His flesh-tints deepened to a reddish hue; and he\nstands baffled before his work, suspecting his sight, since what every\none cries out upon as being bright vermilion, he only sees as a dull\nearthy colour. Boucher has topped the height of his achievement; he\nhas to \"descend the other side of the hill.\" Boucher begins to grow\nold.\n\nIn Boucher's fifty-first year an ugly intrigue of the queen's party at\nCourt to sap the Pompadour's influence over the king by drawing away\nthe king's affections towards Madame de Choiseul-Romanet, a reckless\nyoung beauty of the Court, brought about a strange alliance. The Count\nde Stainville, one of the Pompadour's bitterest enemies, was shown the\nking's letter of invitation to his young kinswoman; and he, deeply\nwounded in his pride that his kinswoman should have been offered to\nthe king, went to the Pompadour and exposed the plot. A close\nalliance followed; and De Stainville thenceforth became her chief\nguide in affairs of state. It was at her instance that the king called\nhim to be his Prime Minister, raising him to the Duchy of Choiseul--a\nname he made illustrious as one of the greatest Ministers of France.\n\nIn his fifty-second year Boucher was appointed to the directorship of\nthe Gobelins looms, to the huge delight of the weavers and all\nconcerned with the tapestry factory. This was the year of his painting\nthe famous portrait of the Pompadour, to whom he several times paid\nthis \"tribute of immorality.\" For the Gobelins looms he produced many\nhandsome designs; and he was painting with astounding industry. But\nhis hand's skill began to falter. His art shows weariness in his\nsixtieth year, and sickness fell upon him, and held him in servitude\nnow with rare moments of respite. The critics, notoriously Diderot,\nwere now attacking him with shameless virulence. Boucher passed it all\nby; but he felt the change that was taking place in the public taste.\n\nThe ideas of the New Philosophy were infecting public opinion; the Man\nof Feeling had arisen in the land; and France, humiliated in war, and\nresenting the follies and the greed of her shameless privileged class,\nwas openly resenting it and all its works. Choiseul had planted his\nstrength deep in the people's party, and was come near to being its\ngod. His masterly mind had checked Frederick of Prussia to the North;\nand the nations, exhausted by the struggle, signed the Peace of Paris\nin 1763. Choiseul, with France at peace abroad, turned to the blotting\nout of the turbulent order of the Jesuits at home. Their attempt to\nend the Pompadour's relations with the king made this powerful woman\neager to complete his design; the chance was soon to come, and the\nOrder was abolished from France and its vast property seized by the\nstate.\n\nThe Pompadour lived but a short while to enjoy her triumph. Worn out\nby her superhuman activities, assailed by debt, she fell ill of a\nracking cough, dying on the 15th of April, 1764, in her forty-second\nyear, keeping her ascendancy over the king and the supreme power in\nFrance to her last hour. Death found her transacting affairs of state.\n\nLouis, weary of his servitude, had only a heartless epigram to cast\nat the body of the dead woman as she passed to her last resting-place.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE END\n\n\nThe death of the Pompadour robbed Boucher of a friend; but her\nbrother, Marigny, remained faithfully attached to the old artist, and\nseized every chance to honour him. On the death of Carle van Loo,\nBoucher, at sixty-two, was made first painter to the king, with all\nhis pensions and privileges that were consistent with this the supreme\nappointment in the art world.\n\nThere had been serious intention of making Boucher the head of the\nEcole des El\u00e8ves Proteg\u00e9s; he had the art of making himself liked and\nof inspiring the love of the arts. He was very popular with the\nstudents and artists, owing to his kindliness, his eagerness to render\nservice, his readiness to encourage the youngsters or to console them.\n\nWhen the riot took place, provoked by the Academicians by their award\nof the Prix de Rome in 1767, the students insulted the Academicians,\nbut hailed Boucher with enthusiastic applause. The reason was not far\nto seek. When a student came to the old master for advice he did not\n\"play the pontiff,\" and, scorning the false dignity of big phrases, he\ntook the brush in his hand and showed the way out of all difficulties\nby simplehearted example, despising rules, and putting himself out in\norder to make things clear to a young artist.\n\nHowever, the Academicians feared he would be an unorthodox master for\nyouth, and appointed another in his place.\n\nA long and serious illness thwarted his keen energies. Diderot was\ngiving himself up to outrageous violence against him. If the old\npainter exhibited at the Salon, Diderot fiercely assailed his art; if\nhe did not exhibit, Diderot as bitterly assailed him for his\nnegligences. Above all, he attacked Boucher in that he did not paint\nwhat Diderot would have painted--but could not. \"When he paints\ninfants,\" cries Diderot, \"you will not find one employed in a real act\nof life--studying his lesson, reading, writing, stripping hemp.\"\n\nPoor unfortunate infants! for whom Philosophy could find no happier\njoy in life than stripping hemp! Boucher was but an artist. He\npainted his generation as far as he could see it, and, with all his\nfaults and weaknesses, he never debauched his art with foreign and\nalien things that had no part in the nation's life; he painted fair\nFrance into his landscapes, not a make-believe land he did not know\nwith preposterous Greek ruins; and best of all, to his eternal honour,\nhe painted infants glad in their gladness to be alive, with no desire\nto send their happy little bodies to school, with no sickly ambition\nto make them into budding philosophers, with no thought of making them\npose and lie as Men of Feeling. He had no joy in setting their little\nbodies to toil--in making them \"teach a lesson to the spectator,\" in\nmaking them stoop their little shoulders to the \"picking of hemp.\"\n\nHe continued to paint as he had always painted--except that he painted\nless well. The wreath of roses was wilting on a grey head. The blood\njigged less warmly in the frail body. The features showed pallid--the\neyes haggard. The sight failed. The hand alone kept something of its\ncunning.\n\nHe went to Holland with his friend Randon du Boisset, but health\nshrank farther from him. Diderot had near spent his last jibe.\n\nIn 1768, Boucher's sixty-fifth year, the neglected queen went to her\ngrave. The king's grief and contrition and vows to amend his life came\ntoo late, and lasted little longer than the drying of the floods of\ntears over the body of his dead consort. A year later he was become\nthe creature of a pretty woman of the gutters, whom he caused to be\nmarried to the Count du Barry--the infamously famous Madame du Barry.\n\nBut neither the remonstrances of Choiseul with the king against this\nfurther degradation of the throne of France, nor his unconcealed scorn\nof the upstart countess, nor the dangerous enemy he made for himself\nthereby, signified now to Boucher, first painter to the king.\n\nBoucher was failing. His son was a prig and a disappointment. His two\nfavourite pupils, Baudoin and Deshayes, who had married his two girls,\ndied.\n\nTo the Salon of 1769 he sent his \"Caravan of Bohemians.\" It was his\nlast display. He had been going about for some time like a gaunt ghost\nof his former self, afflicted with all the ills inevitable to a life\nfeverishly consumed in work and the pursuit of pleasure.\n\nThey went to his studio at five of the clock one May morning, and\nfound him seated at his easel, before a canvas of Venus, dead, with\nthe paint-filled brush fallen out of his fingers.\n\nSo passed he away on the 30th of May 1770, in his sixty-seventh year.\n\nWhen Boucher died, the generation of which he was the limner was near\ncome to its violent end. The rosy carnivals and gay gallantries of his\nage gave way to the blood-stained romance and fierce tempest of the\nRevolution. The garrets of the old curiosity-shops received the\ndiscarded canvases of the master. His shepherds and shepherdesses were\nput to rout by the Romans of his pupil, citizen David. The old order\nwas brought into contempt and overthrown. And with it, Boucher's art,\nlike much that was gracious and charming and good in the evil thing,\nwent down also, and was overwhelmed for a while.\n\nFor a while only. For just as, out of the blood and terror of the\nRevolution, a real France arose, phnix-wise, from the ruin, and in\nbeing born, whilst putting off the vilenesses of the thing from which\nshe sprang, took on also to herself the gracious and winsome qualities\nthat place her amongst the most fascinating peoples of the ages; so\nBoucher has come into his kingdom again--the most gracious of painters\nthat the years have yielded."

                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n        a. One bed, or folding cot,\n        b. One oil stove,\n        c. One lamp,\n        d. Enough supplies of all kinds sufficient for six months,\n        e. Pots, pans, kettles, etc.\nIt is needless to say that positions in Manila and Iloilo were now at\na premium.\n\nWas it possible that teachers were to be sent to places where even the\nnecessaries of life could not be obtained! Was it possible that many\nwould be sent to places so remote that for six months no fresh\nsupplies could be gotten! A mass meeting was held at once, and a\ncommittee was appointed to send a cablegram to the Associated Press\npetitioning aid from the American people at large. Realizing what\nconsternation would be created throughout the United States by such a\nmessage, two of the teachers leaped into a carriage at the close of\nthe meeting and a few moments later were closeted with the chief\nexecutive of the department. As a result the committee was persuaded\nnot to send the cablegram to the Associated Press until by courtesy it\nhad been sent to the President. Of course, this diplomatic move tided\naffairs over and the teachers who had flatly refused to budge from\nManila now agreed to go on to their stations, being assured that\nwhatever action was best would be taken.\n\nThe day had come when we must separate. We were to enter an untried\nand an unknown field. It was fitting that we have a final joyous\nmeeting, so the best orchestra in the archipelago was engaged and we\n\"chased the hours with flying feet\" until dawn so that whatever might\ncome to us in that unknown future upon which we were entering each\nwould hold in pleasant memory our last evening together.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER III. - A DRAMA IN ACTUAL LIFE.\n\n\nAlmost every one heeded the warning to go to his station forearmed\nwith at least necessaries of life, but, as it had never fallen to the\nlot of the writer to cook, he refused to learn at that late day, so he\ntook no pot, no pan, no kettle, putting his future into the hands of\nan uncertain fate and relying upon the unknown hospitality of the\nFilipino.\n\nBacalod, the capital of the province of Occidental Negros, was our\ndestination. The second morning after leaving Manila, we awoke with\nthe \"Kilpatrick\" lying at anchor in a shallow bay. We were several\nmiles from the shore and nothing in sight indicated that we had\nreached a place of any importance. Late the night before we had been\nawakened by the loud, sharp ringing of the ship's bells, accompanied\nby the reversal of the engines and a general disturbance awaking the\ncrew. So our first impressions on coming on deck were that we had run\naground. But the captain assured us that everything was ship-shape and\nthat this was the nearest point of approach to Capiz, a town of\nconsiderable importance on the island of Panay, where a body of troops\nwas to embark for home. Not even the grass hut of a native was in\nsight. Search as we would, not a sign was seen of a stream flowing\ninto the sea, indicating the probable presence of a town. There was\nnot a sign of life of any kind save one lone column of thin, blue\nsmoke that arose from the side of a mountain miles away. One would\nhave thought that we were explorers of three hundred years ago lying\noff the shore of some unknown land.\n\nAfter breakfast the steam launch, together with all the boats, was\nlowered, and several of us who had determined to miss no opportunity\nto gather information about the islands took our places in the launch\nby the side of the ship's mate, and steamed away across the water with\na long line of boats strung out in the rear. We headed away toward a\ngroup of cocoanut trees, and about an hour later stepped ashore on a\npile of decayed coral rocks that extended some twenty or thirty feet\nout into the water, thus forming the only landing place of a town of\nseveral thousands of people and of considerable commercial importance.\n\nA few moments after we had landed, an army wagon drawn by a\nmagnificent pair of mules came up out of a tropical jungle along a\nnarrow road. We clambered into the wagon and were soon lost in the\ndepths of foliage from which we had just seen the vehicle emerge.\n\nLong waving bamboos with their plumy leafage hung over the road from\neach side, meeting and overlapping in the center until they formed an\narchway so dense that the tropical sun now high in the heavens\npenetrated it only at intervals. At times the wagon sank up to the\nhubs in the soft earth, and the muscles of the mules stood out like\nwhip-cords under the skin as they drew us forward.\n\nAt a sharp turn in the road we came upon the first division of troops\nthat was to embark for home. The look of joy upon their sun-browned\nfaces was inexpressible. Their work was done, and with elastic step\nand smiling faces they saluted us as they passed by. The reign of\nforce was at an end; it was going out with them; the reign of peace\nhad begun; it was coming in with us.\n\nIn the afternoon when we returned from the town the last of the troops\nhad arrived and, as we drove up, the bugle was sounding the call to\nsupper. We noticed native women mingling with the troops and, indeed,\na native woman was in constant attention waiting upon one of the\nsoldiers with whom we ate. Her clothes were clean, her hair was nicely\ncombed, and her general appearance was neat. She seemed to anticipate\nthe slightest wish of the soldier with whom she was. She brought him\nwater to drink, cleaned his plate after the meal and saw that his\nknife, fork, and spoon were put into his haversack.\n\nWe had now finished supper and the launch had returned for the last\nload of troops. The lieutenant in command of the company gave the\norder to \"fall in\"; the men shouldered their rifles and fell into\nline. \"Forward, march!\" called the lieutenant, and the column swept\nforward towards the boats. The women had until now restrained\nthemselves, but, as their husbands marched away never to return, their\nfeelings could no longer be restrained. One young woman of about\neighteen, who was leaning against a rock by the roadside sobbing, when\nher husband passed, leaped up in frenzy of passionate love and caught\nthe rifle from his shoulder. Her first impulse seemed to be to throw\nthe gun away, but suddenly realizing the futility of such an act she\nburst into tears, shouldered the rifle herself and marched on by his\nside. Another woman of more mature age threw her arms around the legs\nof a tall stalwart man, and drew him bodily from the line.\n\nBut the troops marched on and entered the boats. One woman who had\nbeen unnoticed before came down into the shallow water and caught hold\nof our last boat as if to prevent its leaving, while others stood\nmingling their sobs with the sounds of the wavelets as they broke on\nthe sands. As we passed away, an expectant mother, standing in bold\noutline against the twilight sky, threw up her hands in an agony of\ndespair and then sank upon the stones. The curtain had fallen upon a\ndrama in actual life deeper in pathos than any other we had ever seen\nor ever expected to see. Depth of passion, depth of love! Who can\nfathom the human heart?\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. - WHAT THE TEACHERS DID.\n\n\nThere is a remarkable sameness about the towns in the Philippines.\n\nThey all have a large open square about the middle of the town, around\nthree sides of which are Chinese stores, unless one side lies open to\nthe sea, and on the fourth is the great stone ecclesia. The streets\nrun at right angles to one another and divide up the town into\ncreditable squares.\n\nEverybody in the Philippines lives up-stairs, for the ground is so\nsoaked with water during the rainy season that it is a menace to\nhealth to live upon the ground floor. So even the poorest nippa hut\nis built upon stakes four or five feet above the ground.\n\nBacalod is a typical Philippine town. As we landed, a broad open\nsquare was spread out before us. Two sides of the square were lined\nwith two-story houses in which were Chinese stores below and Filipino\nhomes above. On the third side stood the great stone church in whose\nmassive tower the clock was striking the hour of four, while the\nfourth lay open to the sea that had borne us thither.\n\nWe landed, but it was in a method new to us and one not usually\nemployed by the traveling public.\n\nWhen our sail boat ran aground on the sandy bottom a hundred yards or\nmore from the shore, a crowd of Filipino men who were on the beach\nslowly rolled up their pantaloons and waded out to the rescue,--for\nthe money that was in it. The boat's crew elevated their trousers'\nlegs also and slided down into the water. Each of us then straddled\nthe neck of a Filipino standing in the water and was held by ankles to\nbe steadied while our biped mounts proceeded to the shore.\n\nWe were now on the ground and face to face with the situation. To give\nthe reader an idea of the actual conditions met by the first teachers\nwho went to the Islands, the following is copied from the instructions\ngiven us in Manila:\n    1. There shall be two sessions daily of all schools, and the\n    last hour of the morning session shall be devoted solely to\n    instructing the Filipino teachers.\n\n    2. In cases where teachers are sent to a town in which there\n    is no school-house, they are expected to secure the aid of the\n    people and have one built.\n\n    3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is\n    stopped.\n\n    4. All supplies must be kept under lock and key. In towns\n    where there is no case or box to lock the supplies in, and it\n    is also impossible to get the town council to furnish a case,\n    a requisition may be sent to Manila, and, if an appropriation\n    can be secured, one will be made and sent out.\n\nThus it can be easily seen that we were indeed pioneers. In many\nplaces no school-house was to be found, and in some cases it was even\ndifficult to get the town council to provide a case in which to keep\nthe supplies.\n\nThe work of the teachers was, in short; to \"make the English language\nthe basis of instruction in the public schools.\" On our arrival at\nBacalod two schools were found in progress, for some soldiers had been\ndetailed for the work here previous to our coming. One of these was\nfor boys and the other, for girls. Thus the work here had been in a\nmeasure simplified, but complications that had arisen at Talisay, one\nof the largest and richest towns on the island, demanded a change of\nteachers and the writer was assigned to the place as superintendent.\n\nHere an attempt had been made to start a school but it had failed\nignominiously and a system of education was to be put into operation\nfrom the very start.\n\nThe Filipinos are not strong advocates of co-education, so separate\nschools were to be started for the boys and the girls. The one for the\nboys was gotten well in hand before the one for the girls was\nattempted at all.\n\nA few days after reaching the town and securing a home the\npresidente of the town had it publicly announced that the following\nMonday morning at eight o'clock a public school for boys would be\nopened in a building that had been rented for the purpose by the\nmunicipal council. About the middle of the afternoon of the same day a\nman beat a little drum throughout all the streets of the town to call\nthe people out and the town clerk announced both in Spanish and in the\nnative language that this public school would begin at the time and\nplace mentioned above; that instruction would be free to all who came;\nthat the government would furnish all supplies; and that instruction\nwould be given in the English language. A native principal and\nassistants were employed and everything was ready to begin.\n\nThe official report of the result is as follows:\n    Boys' public school of Talisay, Negros, P. I., began November\n    4, 1901. Forty-three boys present at eight o'clock. Forty-one\n    of them knew \"good morning\" and \"good afternoon\" but do not\n    know the distinction between them. Two of them speak simple\n    Spanish. At eight forty-five, eight more, who had been\n    attending an early morning private school, came in together.\n\n    The books they brought were so varied and so different from\n    one another that it seemed impossible to bring any reasonable\n    degree of order out of such a chaos, and so, after struggling\n    vainly for about a week with the problem, the superintendent\n    by one fell stroke removed everything in use and put in a\n    uniform system, and from that day on the English language has\n    been the basis of instruction in the public schools of\n    Talisay. The work was of necessity very slow at first, but by\n    the end of a year two schools were going nicely and a number\n    of the brightest boys and girls had made really excellent\n    progress.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER V. - A \"BAILE.\"\n\n\nNot long after the arrival of our party at Bacalod we received an\ninvitation to a \"baile\" given in our honor by the inhabitants of\nSilay, a town some ten or twelve miles up the northern coast and one\nnoted for its social life. The invitation was accepted with pleasure,\nand about the middle of the afternoon on the day appointed we were\nclad in the immaculate white of the tropics and steaming away up the\ncoast on board a launch sent for our conveyance. Twilight was still\nlingering on the path of day when we anchored just off shore at the\ntown. A row-boat containing the officials of the city came out to meet\nus and, in due season, we were ushered into a spacious drawing-room\nfilled almost to overflowing with the \u00e9lite of the town. The \u00e9lite of\ntowns in the Philippines speak Spanish, and, as only one or two of our\nparty could at that time boast of more than a formal acquaintance with\nthe Castilian tongue, the exchange of ideas that evening between us\nand the Filipinos was of necessity not very rapid.\n\nThe necessity of easy communication between us was rendered somewhat\nless indispensable by the announcement of supper as soon as we were\nrested from our trip. When we had taken our places at the table a\nyoung Filipino about twenty-five years of age arose and gave a lengthy\ntoast to the recent union of the Philippines with the United States.\n\nBut as we Americans were unable to scale the dizzy heights of his\nclimaxes or sink to the depths of his pathos, we forewent the\npleasures of his oratory and turned our attention to the savory odor\nof lamb, chicken, and roast pig that came slyly stealing up our\nnostrils to send us nerve dispatches about the gastronomic delights of\nour not far distant future.\n\nAt last the toast was ended and the world-wide soup ushered in a long\ntrain of things good to eat, served in a style better fitted to the\ndelights of the appetite than to the formalities of dinners, for, as\nsoon as the pleasant task of one dish was completed by any one, the\nnext was served him at once regardless of the progress made by the\nothers at the table.\n\nThe last course was dulce. The new-comers to the Philippines will\nnot be long in making the acquaintance of this dish, and at all\nmeetings, both public and private, where eatables are served, it\nperforms an important part. It is anything sweet, and it may vary all\nthe way from an india-rubber-like black mixture of cocoanut milk and\ndirty sugar to a really toothsome and respectable confection. No\nmatter of what materials a dish is composed, just so long as it is\nsweet, it is dulce.\n\nAfter paying our respects to this last course, we arose from the table\nand entered a great rectangular room from the center of whose ceiling\nhung a large glass chandelier, a mass of shimmering crystals. In the\nchairs around the room were the wealth, the youth, and the beauty of\nthe town.\n\nThe first and also the last number of every Filipino dance of any\nformality is the \"rigodon.\" The dancers are arranged in a square, or\nquadrangle according to the number participating, and are then led\nthrough a tangled maze of figures that so utterly bewilders the novice\nthat he sinks into his chair at the end of the dance wondering how it\nall came to pass.\n\nWe Americans breathed a sigh of relief when the \"rigodon\" ended, and\nmustered fresh courage for social conquests in the waltz that was now\nbreathing forth from the trembling strings. My companion in the first\ndance had been the young lady by whose side I had sat at dinner. But\nit now became necessary to search for another, so I prudently waited\nto see how partners were chosen, and made no mistake when a few\nmoments later I faced one of the most luscious looking se\u00f1oritas on\nthe opposite side of the room and offered her my arm. My eyes must\nhave told the story that my lips could not utter in Spanish, for she\nsmiled upon me sweetly, arose, and put her hand upon my shoulder. My\narm encircled her waist and I began to waltz. Unfortunately my\ncompanion did not follow, but began to hop up and down in a manner\nmost distressing. Supposing the attack to be only temporary, I paused\nand, much to my relief, she soon showed signs of recovery; and in the\ncourse of time she came to a standstill looking up into my face in an\ninquiring sort of way, apparently wondering why St. Vitus had not paid\nhis respects to me also. A second attempt to follow the music met with\nresults similar to the first, and during the third attempt, which\nseemed to be trembling on the verge of a failure, St. Vitus let go my\ncompanion and seized me with such vigor that she, who was small even\nfor a Filipino, was gathered up bodily and taken around the room at\nsuch a pace that her toes touched the floor only at far distant\nintervals.\n\nAt this point my devotion to the shrine of Terpsichore ceased from\nforce of circumstances and I seated myself in one of the most\ncomfortable chairs in sight that I might carry out a previously formed\nplan to study the Filipino somewhat critically as he appears in\nsociety.\n\nThe first thing that impressed me as the dancers passed up and down\nthe room was the flash of diamonds. Nearly every woman in the room had\non a brooch that flashed the colors of the rainbow at every turn.\n\nAlmost all of them wore one or more rings that showed up brilliantly\nunder the chandelier. Many of the men too, especially the young men,\nwore gems that appeared to be exquisite. A closer inspection showed\nthat some of the gems had flaws and others were of a poor color, but\nno one would have denied that, taken as a whole, it was a really\nbeautiful display.\n\nThe dress of the ladies was richly colored. Many of their skirts were\nof silk covered with hand embroidered flowers, and their filmy pina\nwaists and broad collar pieces were rich with needle-work. They all\nwore a kind of heelless velvet slipper, very common as a dress shoe in\nthe Philippines, or high-heeled patent leather shoes with neatly\nfitting black stockings.\n\nThe men were dressed in white coats and white pantaloons or black\ncoats and white pantaloons. White shirts and collars, together with\nall sorts and styles of cravats and low-cut patent leather shoes with\nhighly colored socks completed their dress.\n\nIt was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money;\nthat they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a\ntable loaded with good things was a fact to which all of us were\nenthusiastic witnesses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VI. - A SKETCH OF LIFE IN THE PHILIPPINES.\n\n\nHouse-keeping in the Philippines presents some interesting phases. Our\nclub of American officials decided to run a mess, so we employed a\ncook and a house boy, then each of us provided himself with a personal\nservant, making a total of six servants for four men--it takes about\nthis proportion of servants to live in any sort of comfort in the\nPhilippines--and launched ourselves boldly upon the sea of domestic\neconomy. But there were shoals ahead of us, for the question of\nregulating servants is one of no small importance in the Philippines,\nand one of its most disadvantageous features is the long chain of\ndependents that usually attends it.\n\nWe gave the cooks so much a day with which to buy supplies in the\nlocal market, for our own table, making him render a daily list of\nexpenditures, and a fixed amount besides to purchase rice and fish for\nhimself and the other servants. Of course, if they wished to vary\ntheir diet and get chicken and fresh pork, which could be had at far\ndistant intervals, it was wholly a matter of their option, but the\nallowance was made on the basis of so much rice and fish a day for\neach. This allowance was about fifteen cents a day in Spanish coin per\nservant.\n\nThus far all was well. We had agreed to give the cook eight dollars a\nmonth in Spanish money, thinking that good wages would procure good\nservice, but the visions of affluence that floated before him on such\nfloods of wealth were so alluring that they drew him from the kitchen\nto the cooler veranda. In less than a week he had employed an\nassistant at four dollars a month; in less than another week that\nassistant had employed him an assistant at two dollars a month; in\nless than another week that assistant to the assistant had employed\nhim an assistant at the princely salary of fifty cents a month; and\nfrom fear that the chain of dependents would end only by our having\nthe whole Filipino race attached to our culinary force, we broke up\nhouse-keeping and went boarding again, choosing that as the less of\nthe two evils.\n\nOur house furnishings were almost wholly Philippine. The table ware\nand the food on the table came from the ends of the earth. The knives\nand forks were made in Germany, the plates were manufactured in\nEngland, the glass ware and table cloth, in the United States. The\noatmeal and flour came from the United States also. The butter came\nfrom Australia, the rice from China, the salt from Russia, and the\nother eatables from sources about as various as their separate names.\n\nSwitzerland furnished the condensed milk and Illinois the canned\ncream. Nearly all of the canned fruit bore labels from Spain.\n\nThus it can easily be seen that life in the Philippines, if lived\naccording to American ideals, is dependent upon a highly developed and\nhighly complex commerce. However, the difficulties of transportation\nand the restriction of large stocks of merchandise to Manila and some\nhalf a dozen other towns, make so great a difference between country\nlife and city life that a short comparison of the two will not be out\nof place, and life in Manila may well be taken as being fairly typical\nof the latter.\n\nLife in Manila is pleasant, but expensive. It is pleasant from the\nfact that it is not only the capital but also metropolis of the\narchipelago. Thus the combination of wealth and high official position\nhas given to Manila a society of the highest and most refined type.\n\nThe process of beautifying and improving the city which is constantly\ngoing on bids fair to give us at no distant day a city of which we may\nwell be proud.\n\nBut let him who intends living well in Manila on a small income bid\nfarewell at once to so idylic a dream, for it costs much to live well\nthere. In the city of Manila one can get almost anything he wishes,\nbut it must be paid for at the price it commands. Especially in the\ncase of eatables, this price is by no means small, because to the\nfirst cost of articles must in most cases be added the expense of\ndistant shipment from American, European, or Australian ports, and not\ninfrequently the cost of long refrigeration must also be taken into\nconsideration. But, expensive though it is, it is very pleasant to\nlive there and those who have once enjoyed it often wish again to\nquaff the cup of its delights.\n\nIn strong contrast to this pleasant life is the life of the quiet\nlittle hamlet away in the distant islands. Indeed, the Filipino from\nthe distant town, who by some good fortune has been to Manila, or, by\na coup de main, has studied in one of the Manila colleges, is looked\nup to in a true hero-worshiping attitude by all who either know him or\nhear of his fame. Life in such a place is one long state of harmless\ninactivity. Not a wave of trouble from the great outer world ever\ndisturbs its peaceful repose. One lounges forever in an air of\nindolent ease and extreme aversion to anything approaching what might\nbe called a respectable effort.\n\nOne arises in the morning about the time the sun's first rays silver\nthe top leaves of the cocoanut trees and then stirs around until nine\nor ten o'clock, when it is found expedient to avoid a further exposure\nto the sun. From then until about five o'clock in the afternoon it is\nbest to take things as they come, even though one of those things be a\nFilipino dinner. But then you may have your vehiclo attached to a\nyoung bull with a ring in his nose and go for a drive. If it is the\ndry season you will probably enjoy the drive unless you object to the\nfrequent clouds of dust swept along by the evening wind. If it is in\nthe rainy season your pleasure will depend to a considerable extent\nupon how wet you get; but, whether the season be wet or dry, your\npleasure will be regulated largely by the state of harmony existing\nbetween the driver and the bull.\n\nIn these quiet secluded nooks successive generations of Filipinos are\nborn, reared, grow old and die in an even chain of events broken only\nby the occasional erection of a new grass house on the identical spot\nwhere its predecessors have stood for ages. The son lives in the house\nof his father, cultivates the same few square feet of soil planted in\nedible roots, climbs the same cocoanut trees, follows the same winding\npath down to the stream, pounds rice in the same mortar and with the\nsame stick that his ancestors have used from time unremembered, and,\nin case of illness, curls up on a grass mat in a corner of the room\nuntil he dies or by some good fortune recovers. Beyond this narrow\nhorizon he never looks. So narrow and contracted is the life that the\nlanguages of two towns a few miles apart are so different that one\nwould scarcely recognize them as belonging to the same race of people.\n\nSuch are the two extremes of life in our new far Eastern provinces:\nthe one is active, progressive, and cosmopolitan; the other, inactive,\ndecadent, and narrow; but, whether one enjoys the first or endures the\nsecond, there comes to him after leaving a longing to lounge again in\ntropic airs and listen to the lullaby of the winds among the palms.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VII. - THE FILIPINO AT HOME.\n\n\nAs one enters a Filipino sitting-room for the first time, there is one\nfeature in the arrangement of the furniture that impresses itself upon\nhim at once, and it may be stated without fear of serious\ncontradiction that this same peculiar feature in its arrangement will\ncontinue to face him, as he enters different homes, about as certainly\nas he crosses the threshold.\n\nThe arrangement referred to is that of one large mirror, one settee,\nand some ten or a dozen chairs that appear to have had a certain\norderly affection for one another. The mirror is hung upon one of the\nlarge interior parts of the house about four feet above the floor. The\nwooden houses in the Philippines are built by setting large posts\nupright into the ground, extending into the air from twenty to thirty\nfeet. Cross timbers are fastened to these upright posts about eight or\nten feet above the ground and then not sawed off even with the posts,\nbut allowed to extend beyond them each way. The framework of the house\nis built upon these extending cross timbers, a style of building by\nwhich these large upright posts are left standing out on the inside of\nthe room from one to three feet from the walls. It is on that one of\nthese posts most nearly opposite the door that the mirror always finds\nits place. Immediately beneath the mirror is the settee; and the\nchairs are arranged in two parallel lines facing one another and at\nright angles with the ends of the settee. However odd this arrangement\nmay appear to one when he first enters a Filipino drawing-room, there\nare two things to be said in its favor. In the first place, it places\nyou face to face with the person with whom you are conversing so that\nyou can watch him,--a matter of no small moment in the Philippines. In\nthe next place, it enables you to give one of the young ladies a\nsheep's-eye in the mirror while the others present are left where\nMoses was in our much abused conundrum.\n\nThe size of the residence and the quality of its furnishings depends\nupon the wealth of the owner. But there is so vast a difference\nbetween the mode of life of the highest class and the tao, or lowest\nclass, that it is well to speak of them separately, and the great\nmiddle class of Filipinos can easily be imagined to occupy the\nintervening ground.\n\nThe rich Filipino's house is usually of wood built upon a wall of\nstone or brick from ten to fifteen feet high. The floors are kept\nhighly polished in his hallway, dressing-room, and bed-rooms. There\nare, of course, no fire-places in any of the rooms, but on some\noccasions something is needed to dry the rain-soaked atmosphere, for\neven in the dry season it has been seen to rain for five successive\ndays and nights without the cessation of a moment.\n\nA long chain of dependents is attached to the household of the rich\nFilipino. The master has his special body servant to be present at all\ntimes to do his master's bidding, in short, to be the visible\nmechanism of his master's volition. So, too, the lady of the house has\nher servant woman to do the slightest bidding of her ladyship. Then\nthere is the cook who is almost invariably a man, a house boy or two,\nand the coachman. These functionaries, with their assistants and\nassistants to the assistants, together with a servant or two for the\nexclusive service of the children, complete the economic household.\n\nSuch a family has an abundance of rice and wheat bread, also of\nchicken and fish with occasional fresh beef. They have also a good\ndeal of dulce. They regularly serve wine and frequently serve beer\non their tables.\n\nIn strong contrast with this mode of life is that of the tao. His\ndiet consists almost wholly of rice and small uncleaned fish boiled\ntogether. As a rule knife, fork, plate, and spoon find no place in his\nhousehold. The rice and fish are boiled in a pot and then allowed to\ncool in the same vessel or poured out to cool in a large earthen or\nwooden bowl. Then Mr. Tao together with Mrs. Tao and all the young\nTaos squat on their heels around the mixture and satisfy that\nintangible thing called the appetite. They do not use chop sticks as\nthe Chinese do, but the rice and fish are caught in a hollow formed by\nthe first three fingers of the right hand. The thumb is then placed\nbehind the mass. It is raised up and poised before the mouth, with a\nskill coming from the evolution of ages, when a contraction of the\nmuscles of the thumb throws the mass into the mouth with a skill that\nis marvelous to any but a Filipino. To judge from the most reliable\ninformation, the poorest class do not have an abundance of food,\nalthough it would seem that such a condition of things would be\nwell-nigh impossible. However, in a census of one hundred school\nchildren there were found six boys and four girls who declared that\nthey had never had enough to eat, and the native teacher stated that\nthis was probably true.\n\nThe wide gulf between the tao and the rich man is filled by the\ngreat middle class of Filipinos.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VIII. - VISIT TO A LEPER COLONY.\n\n\nNot far from our town was a leper colony and the first Saturday that\ncould be spared was set aside for a trip to the place. It happened\nthat none of the other Americans were at leisure on this particular\nmorning, but, rather then delay the trip or miss it altogether, the\nwriter, armed with a revolver, started out alone.\n\nThe road had been described so accurately by one who was supposed to\nknow it that it was deemed well-nigh impossible to miss the way. The\nmain highway was followed to the point where the by-path supposed to\nlead to the settlement turned off through some bamboo thickets and a\nlow tropical wood. This path led straight away towards the sea-coast\nwhere the houses of the colony were said to stand in a cocoanut grove\nby the beach.\n\nUpon arriving at the settlement, a very inhospitable reception was\nreceived from a mangy cur that growled and showed a very uninviting\nset of sharp, white teeth behind his snarling lips. The growling of\nthe dog had attracted the attention of an old man who, with age-bent\nback, was pounding rice in a mortar about fifty yards away. He turned\nslowly around and, upon seeing an intruder into the primitive quiet of\nthe place, gave a sharp, far-reaching call. The sound had scarcely\nrung through the grove when from about a dozen of the little grass\nhouses dotted here and there fifteen or twenty men armed with bolos\ncame out and gathered around the old man. A sense of my danger flashed\nupon me. Three miles from town and alone in a tropical jungle, I could\nbe almost instantly overcome by this band of bolo-men, and the only\nreport that would ever reach my people would be that I had\n\"disappeared.\" Of course, attack was by no means certain, but the\npotentiality of the situation was thrilling. A drawn revolver and the\ngleaming of its shining barrel had the effect of stopping the men, who\nseemed to be hesitating as to a course of action, until a somewhat\ndignified retreat was made to an open space in the rear from where a\nless dignified and a more hasty retreat began which did not stop short\nof Bacalod.\n\nEnough had been seen, however, even in this short visit, to give\nconvincing proof that the settlement visited was no colony of lepers;\nso, that afternoon two servant boys being taken as guides and\ninterpreters, another attempt was made to reach the goal desired.\n\nThis attempt was successful, and, after about two hours of walking, a\nlittle cluster of grass huts snugly hidden by the sea-coast came into\nview. As we approached, one would have thought it a gala-day. Some few\nchildren, apparently from six to thirteen years of age, almost wholly\nnude, were romping and playing in the open space around which the huts\nstood, and no one would ever have thought that any cloud so horrible\nas leprosy could hover over a place apparently so happy.\n\nBy the side of the path as we passed was a man and his wife setting\nout potato plants. His hands were so puffed and his fingers so short\nthat he could scarcely use them, but he was working along as best he\ncould. His wife's feet were so swollen and twisted that she walked\nonly with the greatest difficulty. We passed them by and entered the\nopen space above referred to.\n\nThe children now saw us, and those of them who could darted away like\nfrightened rabbits, each to his own burrow. An old man who was sitting\nin the warm afternoon sun on the little bamboo platform before his hut\nwas aroused from his lethargic repose by the scampering away of the\nchildren. He arose, trembling upon his tottering limbs, all drawn and\ntwisted, and hobbled away into his hut.\n\nThe children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at\nthe doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of\nthe settlement. In a few moments we were surrounded by a circle of\nhuman beings at once so repulsive and so pitiable that its graphic\nvividness can never be accurately portrayed.\n\nThe old man referred to above, having put on a pair of snow-white\npantaloons, appeared now at the doorway of his hut, followed a few\nmoments later by his wife who had evidently clothed herself in the\nbest raiment she had. At a call from the old man, all the men, women,\nand children in the settlement came out of their huts and stood in a\nline before us. The old man was spokesman and in his native visayan\ntongue made a heart-rending appeal for aid which we were powerless to\ngive. Attention was called to a leper woman, apparently about\ntwenty-five years of age, whose face had been attacked by the disease\nand whose appearance was truly pathetic. Upon her hip was a child\nabout a year and a half old and, strange to say, the child showed as\nyet no signs whatever of the disease.\n\nWhat an indissoluble enigma is life! Here in a little cluster of grass\nhuts in a secluded nook of a secluded island of an all but secluded\narchipelago was gathered together a little community of wretched\nnatives, driven by their loathsomeness from association with others\neven of the same half-savage race. Yet here, men and women loved and\nwere married, by mutual trust if not by law, and children were born of\nthe union to live forever under the unspeakable horror that\novershadowed the unfortunate parents. Love, hatred, sorrow, and\njoy--every passion that enters into the complex structure of the human\nheart even here, in this scene of sadness and despair, was playing\napparently as freely as where misfortune and disease had never crossed\nthe portals of life.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER IX. - A \"HIKE.\"\n\n\nWe were lounging lazily in our hammocks at Jimamaylan one evening in\nApril. Supper was just ended, and the soldiers in the post were\ncollected in groups here and there spinning yarns to pass away the\ntime, when a Filipino clad only in a loin cloth came down the street\nat a steadily swinging run and stopped in front of the sentry. He\nbrought the announcement that a band of ladrones had just burned a\nsugar mill and were advancing to sack a barrio about fifteen miles\naway.\n\nThe invitation of the commanding officer to go on a \"hike\" was eagerly\naccepted, and, in ten minutes after the message was given, the troops\nwere on the march followed by two adventurous pedagogues.\n\nDarkness was just closing in as we left the town, but a resplendent\ntropic moon soon made the night almost as brilliant as the day. The\ntrail we followed led over rough and rocky country. Sometimes for a\ndistance of a mile or more we passed over barren wastes of volcanic\nslag poured out in anger by some peak whose convulsions have long\nsince ceased. Again we would descend into a tropical jungle from the\ndense foliage of which the ladrones could have leaped at any moment,\nhad they known of our coming, and annihilated our little band. We\nforded rapid streams with the water at our breasts, and halted only\nonce in that rapid march of fifteen miles.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the town we met a man who was standing\nguard against a surprise by the ladrones. Nothing could well have been\nmuch more grotesque and nothing could much better illustrate the\nabsolutely primitive condition of the Filipinos in the interior of the\nislands than the appearance of this guard. A pair of knee pants, a\nconical grass hat, and a hemp shirt formed his entire apparel. A long\nflat wooden shield, a bolo, and a long bamboo spear with a sharp,\nflat, iron point, completed his equipment for battle.\n\nHere stood the first and the twentieth centuries side by side. The\nFilipino who had advanced only a stage beyond the condition of\nprimitive man with his knife, spear, and wooden shield, stood side by\nside with the American soldier, a representative of modern life with\nhis magazine rifle, his canteen, his knapsack,--with every article of\nhis clothing made to give him the highest possible efficiency as the\nunit of a military organization.\n\nA few yards farther on we met another guard equipped similarly to the\nfirst. Upon reaching the town, news had just been received that a\ndetachment of troops from another post had intercepted the ladrones\nand fought a skirmish with them. The ladrones had escaped and we set\nout in pursuit of them on a chase wilder than a Quixotic dream. We\nwound our way into the mountains behind the town, inquiring at every\ngrass hut we passed whether the band of ladrones had passed that way,\nbut only once was even a trace of them found. Then it was learned that\nat a certain place they had separated into groups of three or four and\ngone glimmering through the dream of things that were. This place was\nin a secluded nook of the mountains where in years gone by some\nadventurous Spaniard had erected a primitive water mill to grind his\nsugar-cane. We had now marched about twenty miles and the feet of the\npedagogues were a mass of blisters. They had reached the point where\nthat form of military maneuvering called \"hiking\" ceased to possess\nany alluring charms. So a native was persuaded to come out of his lone\nmountain hut and hitch up his carabao and cart. He was then made to\nget on the carabao's back, while the aforesaid pedagogues lay down on\nthe sugar-cane pulp that had been put into the body of the cart, and\nthe driver was instructed to start for the post we had left hours\nbefore, and not to stop until he got there. Being uncertain but that\nsome of the ladrones would learn of our having left the body of troops\nand would try the metal of our steel, we at first agreed that neither\nof us should go to sleep, but it was later decided that probably the\ndriver had no greater desire to cross the Styx than his passengers had\nand that in case of danger he would awaken us, so both took a revolver\nin each hand, stretched out supinely and went to sleep.\n\nSuch a sleep! The rough jolting of the cart over an almost impassable\nroad was never enough to break the spell of slumber. When we awoke the\nblazing tropic sun was past the midday mark of morning, shining full\ninto our unprotected and well-nigh blistered faces.\n\nA pack of dogs were heralding our approach to a little village at the\nfoot of the mountains where ponies were procured to take us back to\nthe post.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he insists, \"have stood the test of ages; and the plant\nevery where retained its name and credit: and one of our good\nherbarists, who had seen a wonderful case of a swoln spleen, so big, and\nhard as to be felt with terror, brought back to a state of nature by it\"\n\n(p. 37). The greatest portion of Hill's concluding section combines\nadvertisement for the powder medicine he was himself manufacturing at a\nhandsome profit together with a protest against competing apothecaries:\n\"An intelligent person was directed to go to the medicinal herb shops in\nthe several markets, and buy some of this Spleen-wort; the name was\nwritten, and shewn to every one; every shop received his money, and\nalmost every one sold a different plant, under the name of this: but\nwhat is very striking, not one of them the right\" (p. 42).\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis did not cease to be printed after Hill's in\n1766, but continued to issue from the presses into the nineteenth\ncentury. A good example of this is the tome by John Reid, physician to\nthe Finsbury Dispensary in London, Essays on Insanity, Hypochondriasis\nand Other Nervous Affections (1816), which summarizes theories of the\nmalady. A bibliographical study of such works would probably reveal\na larger number of titles in the nineteenth century than in the previous\none, but by this time the nature and definition of hypochondria had\nchanged significantly.\n\nIf John Hill's volume is not an important contribution in the history of\nmedicine, it is a lucid and brief exposition of many of the best ideas\nthat had been thought and written on the hyp, with the exception of his\nuninhibited prescribing of herbal medicines as cure-alls. An\nunderstanding of this disease is essential for readers of neoclassical\nEnglish literature, especially when we reflect upon the fact that some\nof the best literature of the period was composed by writers whom it\nafflicted. It is perhaps not without significance that the greatest poet\nof the Augustan age, Alexander Pope, thought it necessary as he lay on\nhis deathbed in May 1744 to exclaim with his last breath, \"I never was\nhippish in my whole life.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. I. - The NATURE of the DISORDER.\n\n\nTo call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and cruel. It\nis a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by thickened\nand distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver, and other\nparts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick scarce knows\none more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\n\nThe blood is a mixture of many fluids, which, in a state of health, are\nso combined, that the whole passes freely through its appointed vessels;\nbut if by the loss of the thinner parts, the rest becomes too gross to\nbe thus carried through, it will stop where the circulation has least\npower; and having thus stopped it will accumulate; heaping by degrees\nobstruction on obstruction.\n\nHealth and chearfulness, and the quiet exercise of mind, depend upon a\nperfect circulation: is it a wonder then, when this becomes impeded the\nbody looses of its health, and the temper of its sprightliness? to be\notherwise would be the miracle; and he inhumanly insults the afflicted,\nwho calls all this a voluntary frowardness. Its slightest state brings\nwith it sickness, anguish and oppression; and innumerable ills follow\nits advancing steps, unless prevented by timely care; till life itself\ngrows burthensome.\n\nThe disease was common in antient Greece; and her physicians understood\nit, better than those perhaps of later times, in any other country; who\nthough happy in many advantages these fathers of the science could not\nhave, yet want the great assistance of frequent watching it in all its\nstages.\n\nThose venerable writers have delivered its nature, and its cure: in the\nfirst every thing now shews they were right; and what they have said as\nto the latter will be found equally true and certain. This, so far as\npresent experience has confirmed it, and no farther, will be here laid\nbefore the afflicted in a few plain words.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. II. - Persons Subject to it.\n\n\nFatigue of mind, and great exertion of its powers often give birth to\nthis disease; and always tend to encrease it. The finer spirits are\nwasted by the labour of the brain: the Philosopher rises from his study\nmore exhausted than the Peasant leaves his drudgery; without the benefit\nthat he has from exercise. Greatness of mind, and steady virtue;\ndetermined resolution, and manly firmness, when put in action, and\nintent upon their object, all also lead to it: perhaps whatever tends to\nthe ennobling of the soul has equal share in bringing on this weakness\nof the body.\n\nFrom this we may learn easily who are the men most subject to it; the\ngrave and studious, those of a sedate temper and enlarged understanding,\nthe learned and wise, the virtuous and the valiant: those whom it were\nthe interest of the world to wish were free from this and every other\nillness; and who perhaps, except for this alloy, would have too large a\nportion of human happiness.\n\nThough these are most, it is not these alone, who are subject to it.\n\nThere are countries where it is endemial, and in other places some have\nthe seeds of it in their constitution; and in some it takes rise from\naccidents. In these last it is the easiest of cure; and in the first\nmost difficult.\n\nBeside the Greeks already named, the Jews of old time were heavily\nafflicted with this disease; and in their descendants to this day it is\noften constitutional: the Spaniards have it almost to a man; and so have\nthe American Indians. Perhaps the character of these several nations may\nbe connected with it. The steady honour, and firm valour of the\nSpaniard, very like that of the ancient Doric nation, who followed the\nflute not the trumpet to the field; and met the enemy, not with shouts\nand fury, but with a determined virtue: it is the temper of the\nHypochondriac to be slow, but unmoveably resolved: the Jew has shewn\nthis mistakenly, but almost miraculously; and the poor Indian, untaught\nas he is, faces all peril with composure, and sings his death-song with\nan unalter'd countenance.\n\nAmong particular persons the most inquiring and contemplative are those\nwho suffer oftenest by this disease; and of all degrees of men I think\nthe clergy. I do not mean the hunting, shooting, drinking clergy, who\nbear the tables of the great; but the retir'd and conscientious; such as\nattend in midnight silence to their duty; and seek in their own cool\nbreasts, or wheresoever else they may be found, new admonitions for an\nage plunged in new vices. To this disease we owe the irreparable loss of\nDr. YOUNG; and the present danger of many other the best and most\nimproved amongst us. May what is here to be proposed assist in their\npreservation!\n\nThe Geometrician or the learned Philosopher of whatever denomination,\nwhose course of study fixes his eye for ever on one object, his mind\nintensely and continually employed upon one thought, should be warned\nalso that he is in danger; or if he find himself already afflicted, he\nshould be told that the same course of life, which brought it on, will,\nwithout due care, encrease it to the most dreaded violence.\n\nThe middle period of life is that in which there is the greatest danger\nof an attack from this disease; and the latter end of autumn, when the\nsummer heats have a little time been over, is the season when in our\nclimate its first assaults are most to be expected. The same time of the\nyear always increases the disorder in those who have been before\nafflicted with it; and it is a truth must be confessed, that from its\nfirst attack the patient grows continually, though slowly, worse; unless\na careful regimen prevent it.\n\nThe constitutions most liable to this obstruction are the lean, and dark\ncomplexioned; the grave and sedentary. Let such watch the first\nsymptoms; and obviate, (as they may with ease) that which it will be\nmuch more difficult to remove.\n\nIt is happy a disease, wherein the patient must do a great deal for\nhimself, falls, for the most part, upon those who have the powers of\nreason strongest. Let them only be aware of this, that the distemper\nnaturally disposes them to inactivity; and reason will have no use\nunless accompanied with resolution to enforce it.\n\nThough the physician can do something toward the cure, much more depends\nupon the patient; and here his constancy of mind will be employed most\nhappily. No one is better qualified to judge on a fair hearing what\ncourse is the most fit; and having made that choice, he must with\npatience wait its good effects. Diseases that come on slowly must have\ntime for curing; an attention to the first appearances of the disorder\nwill be always happiest; because when least established it is easiest\noverthrown: but when that happy period has been neglected, he must wait\nthe effects of such a course as will dilute and melt the obstructing\nmatter gradually; for till that be done it is not only vain, but\nsometimes dangerous, to attempt its expulsion from the body.\n\nThe blood easily separates itself into the grosser and the thinner\nparts: we see this in bleeding; and from the toughness of the red cake\nmay guess how very difficult it will be to dissolve a substance of like\nfirmness in the vessels of the body. That it can thus become thickened\nwithin the body, a Pleurisy shews us too evidently: in that case it is\nbrought on suddenly, and with inflammation; in this other, slowly and\nwithout; and here, even before it forms the obstruction, can bring on\nmany mischiefs. Various causes can produce the same effect, but that in\nall cases operates most durably, which operates most slowly. The watery\npart of the blood is its mild part; in the remaining gross matter of it,\nare acrid salts and burning oils, and these, when destitute of that\nhappy dilution nature gives them in a healthy body, are capable of doing\ngreat mischief to the tender vessels in which they are kept stagnant.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. III. - The SYMPTOMS of the DISORDER.\n\n\nThe first and lightest of the signs that shew this illness are a lowness\nof spirits, and inaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love\nof solitude and a habit of thinking, even on trifling subjects, with too\nmuch steadiness. A very little help may combat these: but if that\nindolence which is indeed a part of the disorder, will neglect them;\nworse must be expected soon to follow.\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness, weight, and oppression in the body,\na want of appetite, or, what is worse, an appetite without digestion;\nfor these are the conditions of different states of the disease, a\nfullness and a difficulty of breathing after meals, a straitness of the\nbreast, pains and flatulencies in the bowels, and an unaptness to\ndischarge their contents.\n\nThe pulse becomes low, weak, and unequal; and there are frequent\npalpitations of the heart, a little dark-coloured urine is voided at\nsome times; and a flood of colourless and insipid at others; relieving\nfor a moment, but increasing the distemper: there is in some cases also\na continual teazing cough, with a choaking stoppage in the throat at\ntimes; then heartburn, sickness, hardness of the belly, and a costive\nhabit, or a tormenting and vain irritation.\n\nThe lips turn pale, the eyes loose their brightness and by degrees the\nwhite grows as it were greenish, the gums want their due firmness, with\ntheir proper colour; and an unpleasing foulness grows upon the teeth:\nthe inside of the mouth is pale and furred, and the throat dry and\nhusky: the colour of the skin is pale (though there are periods when the\nface is florid) and as the obstruction gathers ground, and more affects\nthe liver, the whole body becomes yellow, tawny, greenish, and at length\nof that deep and dusky hue, to which men of swift imagination have given\nthe name of blackness.\n\nThese symptoms do not all appear in any one period of the disease, or in\none case, but at one time or other all of them, as well as those which\nfollow: the flesh becomes cold to the touch, though the patient does not\nhimself perceive it; the limbs grow numbed and torpid, the breathing\ndull and slow, and the voice hollow; and usually the appetite in this\nperiod declines, and comes almost to nothing: night sweats come on,\nblack swellings appear on the veins, the flesh wastes and the breast\nbecomes flat and hollow: the mouth is full of a thin spittle, the head\nis dizzy and confus'd, and sometimes there is an unconquerable numbness\nin the organs of speech.\n\nI have known the temporary silence that follows upon this last symptom\nbecome a jest to the common herd; and the unhappy patient, instead of\ncompassion and assistance, receive the reproof of sullenness, from those\nwho should have known and acted better.\n\nAbout twenty years ago I met on a visit at Catthorpe in Leicestershire a\nyoung gentleman of distinguished learning and abilities, who at certain\ntimes was speechless. The vulgar thought it a pretence: and a jocose\nlady, where he was at tea with company, putting him as she said to a\ntrial, poured out a dish very strong and without sugar. He drank it and\nreturned the cup with a bow of great reserve, and his eye bent on the\nground: she then filled the cup with sugar, and pouring weak tea on it,\nsent it him: he drank that too, looked at her steadily, and blushed for\nher. The lady declared the man was dumb; the rest thought him perverse,\nand obstinate; but a constant and steady perseverance in an easy method\ncured him.\n\nAll these are miseries which the disease, while it retains its natural\nform, can bring upon the patient; and thus he will in time be worn out,\nand led miserably, though slowly, to the grave. Let him not indulge his\ninactivity so far as to give way to this, because it is represented as\nfar off; the disease may suddenly and frightfully change its nature; and\nswifter evils follow.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. IV. - The DANGER.\n\n\nWe have done with the obstruction considered in itself; but this, though\noften unsurmountable by art, at least by the methods now in use, will be\nsometimes broken through at once by nature, or by accidents; and bring\non fatal evils. These are strictly different diseases, and are no\notherway concerned here, than as the consequences of that of which we\nare treating.\n\nThe thick and glutinous blood which has so long stagnated in the spleen,\nwill have in that time altered its nature, and acquired a very great\ndegree of acrimony: while it lies dormant, this does no more mischiefs,\nthan those named already; but when violent exercise, a fit of outrageous\nanger, or any thing else that suddenly shocks and disturbs the frame,\nputs it in motion, it melts at once into a kind of liquid putrefaction.\n\nBeing now thin, it mixes itself readily with the blood again, and brings\non putrid fevers; destroys the substance of the spleen itself, or being\nthrown upon some other of the viscera, corrodes them, and leads on this\nway a swift and miserable death. If it fall upon the liver, its tender\npulpy substance is soon destroyed, jaundices beyond the help of art\nfirst follow, then dropsies and all their train of misery; if on lungs,\nconsumptions; if on the brain, convulsions, epilepsy, palsy, apoplexy;\nif on the surface, leprosy.\n\nThe intention of cure is to melt this coagulation softly, not to break\nit violently; and then to give it a very gentle passage through the\nbowels. There is no safe way for it to take but that; and even that when\nurged too far may bring on fatal dysenteries.\n\nLet none wonder at the sudden devastation which sometimes arises from\nthis long stagnant matter, when liquified too hastily: how long, how\nmany years the impacted matter will continue quiet in a schirrous tumour\nof the breast; but being once put in motion, whether from accident, or\nin the course of nature, what can describe; or what can stop its\nhavock!\n\nInstances of the other are too frequent. A nobleman the other day died\nparalytick: dissection shewed a spleen consumed by an abscess, formed\nfrom the dissolved matter of such an obstruction: and 'tis scarce longer\nsince, a learned gentleman, who had been several years lost to his\nfriends, by the extreams of a Hypochondriacal disorder, seem'd gradually\nwithout assistance to recover: but the lungs suffered while the spleen\nwas freed; and he died very soon of what is called a galloping\nconsumption.\n\nWhen the obstruction is great and of long continuance, if it be thus\nhastily moved, the consequence is, equally, a sudden and a miserable\ndeath, whether, like the matter of a cancer, it remains in its place; or\nlike that of a bad small pox, be thrown upon some other vital part.\n\nLet not the patient be too much alarmed; this is laid down to caution,\nnot to terrify him: it is fit he should know his danger, and attend to\nit; for the prevention is easy; and the cure, even of the most advanced\nstages, when undertaken by gentle means, is not at all impracticable: to\nassist the physician, let him look into himself, and recollect the\nsource of his complaint. This he may judge of from the following\nnotices.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. V. - The Causes of the HYPOCHONDRIASIS.\n\n\nThe obstruction which forms this disease, may take its origin from\ndifferent accidents: a fever ill cured has often caused it; or the\npiles, which had been used to discharge largely, ceasing; a marshy soil,\npoisoned with stagnant water, has given it to some persons; and altho'\nindolence and inactivity are oftenest at the root, yet it has arisen\nfrom too great exercise.\n\nReal grief has often brought it on; and even love, for sometimes that is\nreal. Study and fixed attention of the mind have been accused before;\nand add to these the stooping posture of the body, which most men use,\nthough none should use it, in writing and in reading. This has\ncontributed too much to it; but of all other things night studies are\nthe most destructive. The steady stillness, and dusky habit of all\nnature in those hours, enforce, encourage, and support that settled\ngloom, which rises from fixt thought; and sinks the body to the grave;\neven while it carries up the mind to heaven. He who would have his lamp\n        At midnight hour\n  Be seen in some high lonely tower,\nwill waste the flame of this unheeded life: and while he labours to\nunsphere the spirit of Plato will let loose his own.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VI. - The Cure of the HYPOCHONDRIASIS.\n\n\nLet him who would escape the mischiefs of an obstructed spleen, avoid\nthe things here named: and let him who suffers from the malady,\nendeavour to remember to which of them it has been owing; for half the\nhope depends upon that knowledge.\n\nNature has sometimes made a cure herself, and we should watch her ways;\nfor art never is so right as when it imitates her: sometimes the\npatient's own resolution has set him free. This is always in his power,\nand at all times will do wonders.\n\nThe bleeding of the piles, from nature's single efforts, has at once\ncured a miserable man; where their cessation was the cause of the\ndisorder. A leprosy has appeared upon the skin, and all the symptoms of\nthe former sickness vanished. This among the Jews happened often: both\ndiseases we know were common among them: and I have here seen something\nvery like it: Water-Dock has thrown out scorbutic eruptions, and all the\nformer symptoms of an Hypochondriacal disorder have disappeared:\nreturning indeed when these were unadvisedly struck in; but keeping off\nentirely when they were better treated. A natural purging unsuppressed\nhas sometimes done the same good office: but this is hazardous.\n\nIt is easy to be directed from such instances; only let us take the\nwhole along with us. Bleeding would have answered nature's purpose, if\nshe could not have opened of herself the h\u00e6morrhoidal vessels; but he\nwho should give medicines for that purpose, might destroy his patient by\ntoo great disturbance. If a natural looseness may perform the cure, so\nmay an artificial; when the original source of the disorder points that\nway. But these are helps that take place only in particular cases.\n\nThe general and universal method of cure must be by some mild and gently\nresolving medicine, under the influence of which the obstructing matter\nmay be voided that, or some other way with safety. The best season to\nundertake this is the autumn, but even here there must be caution.\n\nIn the first place, no strong evacuating remedy must be given; for that,\nby carrying off the thinner parts of the juices, will tend to thicken\nthe remainder; and certainly encrease the distemper. No acrid medicine\nmust be directed, for that may act too hastily, dissolve the impacted\nmatter at once, and let it loose, to the destruction of the sufferer; no\nantimonial, no mercurial, no martial preparation must be taken; in\nshort, no chymistry: nature is the shop that heaven has set before us,\nand we must seek our medicine there. The venerable ancients, who knew\nnot this new art, will lead us in the search; and (faithful relators as\nthey are of truth) will tell us whence we may deduce our hope; and what\nwe are to fear.\n\nBut prior to the course of any medicine, and as an essential to any good\nhope from it, the patient must prescribe himself a proper course of\nlife, and a well chosen diet: let us assist him in his choice; and speak\nof this first, as it comes first in order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VI. - Rules of Life for Hypochondriac Persons.\n\n\nAir and exercise, as they are the best preservers of health, and\ngreatest assistants in the cure of all long continued diseases, will\nhave their full effect in this; but there requires some caution in the\nchoice, and management of them. It is common to think the air of high\ngrounds best; but experience near home shews otherwise: the\nHypochondriac patient is always worse at Highgate even than in London.\n\nThe air he breathes should be temperate; not exposed to the utmost\nviolences of heat and cold, and the swift changes from one to the\nother; which are most felt on those high grounds. The side of a hill is\nthe best place for him: and though wet grounds are hurtful; yet let\nthere be the shade of trees, to tempt him often to a walk; and soften by\ntheir exhalation the over dryness of the air.\n\nThe exercise he takes should be frequent; but not violent. Motion\npreserves the firmness of the parts, and elasticity of the vessels; it\nprevents that aggregation of thick humours which he is most to fear. A\nsedentary life always produces weakness, and that mischief always\nfollows: weak eyes are gummy, weak lungs are clogged with phlegm, and\nweak bowels waste themselves in vapid diarrhoeas.\n\nLet him invite himself abroad, and let his friends invite him by every\ninnocent inducement. For me, I should advise above all other things the\nstudy of nature. Let him begin with plants: he will here find a\ncontinual pleasure, and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful\nthings; even of the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to\nwalk; and every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket,\nwill afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually\nin the air, and continually to change the nature and quality of the air,\nby visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the lawn, the\nheath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be abroad; and the\nunceasing variety of the subjects of his observation, will prevent his\nwalking hastily: he will pursue his studies in the air; and that\ncontemplative turn of mind, which in his closet threatened his\ndestruction, will thus become the great means of his recovery.\n\nIf the mind tire upon this, from the repeated use, another of nature's\nkingdoms opens itself at once upon him; the plant he is weary of\nobserving, feeds some insect he may examine; nor is there a stone that\nlies before his foot, but may afford instruction and amusement.\n\nEven what the vulgar call the most abject things will shew a wonderful\nutility; and lead the mind, in pious contemplation higher than the\nstars. The poorest moss that is trampled under foot, has its important\nuses: is it at the bottom of a wood we find it? why there it shelters\nthe fallen seeds; hides them from birds, and covers them from frost;\nand thus becomes the foster father of another forest! creeps it along\nthe surface of a rock? even there its good is infinite! its small roots\nrun into the stone, and the rains make their way after them; the moss\nhaving lived its time dies; it rots and with the mouldered fragments of\nthe stone forms earth; wherein, after a few successions, useful plants\nmay grow, and feed more useful cattle!\n\nIs there a weed more humble in its aspect, more trampled on, or more\ndespised than knot grass! no art can get the better of its growth, no\nlabour can destroy it; 'twere pity if they could, for the thing lives\nwhere nothing would of use to us; and its large and most wonderfully\nabundant seeds, feed in hard winters, half the birds of Heaven.\n\nWhat the weak moss performs upon the rock the loathed toadstool brings\nabout in timber: is an oak dead where man's eye will not find it? this\nfungus roots itself upon the bark, and rots the wood beneath it; hither\nthe beetle creeps for shelter, and for sustenance; him the woodpecker\nfollows as his prey; and while he tears the tree in search of him, he\nscatters it about the ground; which it manures.\n\nNor is it the beetle alone that thus insinuates itself into the\nsubstance of the vegetable tribe: the tender aphide, whom a touch\ndestroys, burrows between the two skins of a leaf, for shelter from his\nwinged enemies; tracing, with more than Dedal\u00e6an art, his various\nmeanders; and veining the green surface with these white lines more\nbeautifully than the best \u00c6gyptian marble.\n\n'Twere endless to proceed; nor is it needful: one object will not fail\nto lead on to another, and every where the goodness of his God will\nshine before him even in what are thought the vilest things; his\ngreatness in the lead of them.\n\nLet him pursue these thoughts, and seek abroad the objects and the\ninstigations to them: but let him in these and all other excursions\navoid equally the dews of early morning, and of evening.\n\nThe more than usual exercise of this prescription will dispose him to\nmore than customary sleep, let him indulge it freely; so far from\nhurting, it will help his cure.\n\nLet him avoid all excesses: drink need scarce be named, for we are\nwriting to men of better and of nobler minds, than can be tempted to\nthat humiliating vice. Those who in this disorder have too great an\nappetite, must not indulge it; much eaten was never well digested: but\nof all excesses the most fatal in this case is that of venery. It is the\nexcess we speak of.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VII. - The proper DIET.\n\n\nIn the first place acids must be avoided carefully; and all things that\nare in a state of fermentation, for they will breed acidity. Provisions\nhardened by salting never should be tasted; much less those cured by\nsmoaking, and by salting. Bacon is indigestible in an Hypochondriac\nstomach; and hams, impregnated as is now the custom, with acid fumes\nfrom the wood fires over which they are hung, have that additional\nmischief.\n\nMilk ought to be a great article in the diet: and even in this there\nshould be choice. The milk of grass-fed cows has its true quality: no\nother. There are a multitude of ways in which this may be made a part\nboth of our foods and drinks, and they should all be used.\n\nThe great and general caution is that the diet be at all times of a kind\nloosening and gently stimulating; light but not acrid. Veal, lamb,\nfowls, lobsters, crabs, craw-fish, fresh water fish and mutton broth,\nwith plenty of boiled vegetables, are always right; and give enough\nvariety.\n\nRaw vegetables are all bad: sour wines, old cheese, and bottled beer are\nthings never to be once tasted. Indeed much wine is wrong, be it of what\nkind soever. It is the first of cordials; and as such I would have it\ntaken in this disease when it is wanted: plainly as a medicine, rather\nthan a part of diet. Malt liquor carefully chosen is certainly the best\ndrink. This must be neither new, nor tending to sourness; perfectly\nclear, and of a moderate strength: it is the native liquor of our\ncountry, and the most healthful.\n\nToo much tea weakens; and even sugar is in this disorder hurtful: but\nhoney may supply its place in most things; and this is not only harmless\nbut medicinal; a very powerful dissolvent of impacted humours, and a\ngreat deobstruent.\n\nWhat wine is drank should be of some of the sweet kinds. Old Hock has\nbeen found on enquiry to yield more than ten times the acid of the sweet\nwines; and in red Port, at least in what we are content to call so,\nthere is an astringent quality, that is most mischievous in these cases:\nit is said there is often alum in it: how pregnant with mischief that\nmust be to persons whose bowels require to be kept open, is most\nevident. Summer fruits perfectly ripe are not only harmless but\nmedicinal; but if eaten unripe they will be very prejudicial. A light\nsupper, which will leave an appetite for a milk breakfast, is always\nright; this will not let the stomach be ravenous for dinner, as it is\napt to be in those who make that their only meal.\n\nOne caution more must be given, and it may seem a strange one: it is\nthat the patient attend regularly to his hours of eating. We have to do\nwith men for the most part whose soul is the great object of their\nregard; but let them not forget they have a body.\n\nThe late Dr. STUKELY has told me, that one day by appointment visiting\nSir ISAAC NEWTON, the servant told him, he was in his study. No one was\npermitted to disturb him there; but as it was near dinner time, the\nvisitor sat down to wait for him. After a time dinner was brought in; a\nboil'd chicken under a cover. An hour pass'd, and Sir ISAAC did not\nappear. The doctor eat the fowl, and covering up the empty dish, bad\nthem dress their master another. Before that was ready, the great man\ncame down; he apologiz'd for his delay, and added, \"give me but leave to\ntake my short dinner, and I shall be at your service; I am fatigued and\nfaint.\" Saying this, he lifted up the cover; and without any emotion,\nturned about to STUKELY with a smile; \"See says he, what we studious\npeople are, I forgot I had din'd.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VIII. - The MEDICINE.\n\n\n'Tis the ill fate of this disease, more than of all others to be\nmisunderstood at first, and thence neglected; till the physician shakes\nhis head at a few first questions. None steals so fatally upon the\nsufferer: its advances are by very slow degrees; but every day it grows\nmore difficult of cure.\n\nThat this obstruction in the spleen is the true malady, the cases\nrelated by the antients, present observation, and the unerring\ntestimonies of dissections leave no room to doubt. Being understood, the\npath is open where to seek a remedy: and our best guides in this, as in\nthe former instance, will be those venerable Greeks; who saw a thousand\nof these cases, where we see one; and with less than half our theory,\ncured twice as many patients.\n\nOne established doctrine holds place in all these writers; that whatever\nby a hasty fermentation dissolves the impacted matter of the\nobstruction, and sends it in that state into the blood, does incredible\nmischief: but that whatever medicine softens it by slow degrees, and, as\nit melts, delivers it to the bowels without disturbance; will cure with\nequal certainty and safety.\n\nFor this good purpose, they knew and tried a multitude of herbs; but in\nthe end they fixed on one: and on their repeated trials of this, they\nbanished all the rest. This stood alone for the cure of the disease; and\nfrom its virtue received the name of SPLEEN-WORT. O wise and happy\nGreeks! authors of knowledge and perpetuators of it! With them the very\nname they gave a plant declared its virtues: with us, a writer calls a\nplant from some friend; that the good gardener who receives the honour,\nmay call another by his name who gave it. We now add the term smooth\nto this herb, to distinguish it from another, called by the same general\nterm, though not much resembling it.\n\nThe virtues of this smooth Spleen-wort have flood the test of ages; and\nthe plant every where retained its name and credit: and one of our good\nherbalists, who had seen a wonderful case of a swoln spleen, so big, and\nhard as to be felt with terror, brought back to a state of nature by it;\nand all the miserable symptoms vanish; thought Spleen-wort not enough\nexpressive of its excellence; but stamp'd on it the name of MILT-WASTE.\n\nIn the Greek Islands now, the use of it is known to every one; and even\nthe lazy monks who take it, are no longer splenetic. In the west of\nEngland, the rocks are stripped of it with diligence; and every old woman\ntells you how charming that leaf is for bookish men: in Russia they use\na plant of this kind in their malt liquor: it came into fashion there\nfor the cure of this disease; which from its constant use is scarce\nknown any longer; and they suppose 'tis added to their liquor for a\nflavour.\n\nThe ancients held it in a kind of veneration; and used what has been\ncalled a superstition in the gathering it. It was to be taken up with a\nsharp knife, without violence, and laid upon the clean linen: no time\nbut the still darkness of the night was proper, and even the moon was\nnot to shine upon it. I know they have been ridiculed for this; for\nnothing is so vain as learned ignorance: but let me be permitted once to\nvindicate them.\n\nThe plant has leaves that can close in their sides; and their under part\nis covered thick with a yellow powder, consisting of the seeds, and seed\nvessels: in these they knew the virtue most resided: this was the golden\ndust they held so valuable; and this they knew they could not be too\ncautious to preserve. They were not ignorant of the sleep of plants; a\nmatter lately spoken of by some, as if a new discovery; and being\nsensible that light, a dry air, an expanded leaf, and a tempestuous\nseason, were the means of losing this fine dust; and knowing also that\ndarkness alone brought on that closing of the leaf which thence has\nbeen called sleep; and which helped to defend and to secure it, they\ntherefore took such time, and used such means as could best preserve the\nplant entire; and even save what might be scattered from it.--And now\nwhere is their superstition?\n\nFrom this plant thus collected they prepared a medicine, which in a\ncourse of forty days scarce ever failed to make a perfect cure.\n\nWe have the plant wild with us; and till the fashion of rough chemical\npreparations took off our attention from these gentler remedies, it was\nin frequent use and great repute. I trust it will be so again: and many\nthank me for restoring it to notice.\n\nSpleen-wort gives out its virtues freely in a tincture; and a small dose\nof this, mixing readily with the blood and juices, gradually dissolves\nthe obstruction; and by a little at a time delivers its contents to be\nthrown off without pain, from the bowels. Let this be done while the\nviscera are yet sound and the cure is perfect. More than the forty days\nof the Greek method is scarce ever required; much oftener two thirds of\nthat time suffice; and every day, from the first dose of it, the patient\nfeels the happy change that is growing in his constitution. His food no\nmore turns putrid on his stomach, but yields its healthful nourishment.\n\nThe swelling after meals therefore vanishes; and with that goes the\nlowness, and anxiety, the difficult breath, and the distracting cholick:\nhe can bear the approach of rainy weather without pain; he finds himself\nmore apt for motion, and ready to take that exercise which is to be\nassistant in his cure; life seems no longer burthensome. His bowels get\ninto the natural condition of health, and perform their office once at\nleast a day; better if a little more: the dull and dead colour of his\nskin goes off, his lips grow red again, and every sign of health\nreturns.\n\nLet him who takes the medicine, say whether any thing here be\nexaggerated. Let him, if he pleases to give himself the trouble, talk\nover with me, or write to me, this gradual decrease of his complaints,\nas he proceeds in his cure. My uncertain state of health does not\npermit me to practise physic in the usual way, but I am very desirous to\ndo what good I can, and shall never refuse my advice, such as it may be,\nto any person rich or poor, in whatever manner he may apply for it. I\nshall refer him to no apothecary, whose bills require he should be\ndrenched with potions; but tell him, in this as in all other cases,\nwhere to find some simple herb; which he may if he please prepare\nhimself; or if he had rather spare that trouble, may have it so prepared\nfrom me.\n\nWith regard to Spleen-wort, no method of using it is more effectual than\nsimply taking it in powder; the only advantage of a tincture, is that a\nproper dose may be given, and yet the stomach not be loaded with so\nlarge a quantity: it is an easier and pleasanter method, and nothing\nmore.\n\nIf any person choose to take it in the other way, I should still wish\nhim once at least to apply to me; that he may be assured what he is\nabout to take is the right plant. Abuses in medicines are at this time\nvery great, and in no instance worse than what relates to herbs. The\nbest of our physicians have complained upon this head with warmth, but\nwithout redress: they know the virtues and the value of many of our\nnative plants, but dread to prescribe them; lest some wrong thing should\nbe administered in their place; perhaps inefficacious, perhaps\nmischievous, nay it may be fatal. The few simple things I direct are\nalways before me; and it will at all times be a pleasure to me, in this\nand any other instance, to see whether what any person is about to take\nbe right. I have great obligations to the public, and this is the best\nreturn that I know how to make.\n\nTo see the need of such a caution, hear a transaction but of yesterday!\n\nAn intelligent person was directed to go to the medicinal herb shops in\nthe several markets, and buy some of this Spleen-wort; the name was\nwritten, and shewn to every one; every shop received his money, and\nalmost every one sold a different plant, under the name of this: but\nwhat is very striking, not one of them the right. Such is the chance of\nhealth in those hands through which the best means of it usually pass;\neven in the most regular course of application.\n\nI would not be understood to limit the little services I may this way be\nable to render the afflicted, to this single instance; much less to\npropose to myself any advantages from it. Whoever pleases will be\nwelcome to me, upon any such occasion; and whatever be the herb on which\nhe places a dependance, he shall be shewn it growing. I once recommended\na garden to be established for this use, at the public expence: one\ngreat person has put it in my power to answer all its purposes.\n\n                        F  I  N  I  S.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris, he was\n\"nominated\" to the Academy. He had but to present an Historical\nPainting in order to take his seat as an Academician.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VENUS AND MARRIAGE\n\n\nBack in his beloved Paris again; thrilled by the atmosphere and gaiety\nof its merry life; in the full vigour of manhood on the eve of his\nthirties; amongst congenial friends; done with the drudgery of winning\nto Academic honour, Boucher saw that the public were not falling over\neach other to purchase religious or historic pictures; he straightway\nturned his back upon these things, and on the edge of his thirtieth\nyear he gave to the world his \"Marriage of the Children of God with\nthe Children of Men,\" in which Venus is the avowed mistress of his\nadoration. It caused a fine stir, and greatly increased his repute.\n\nIn this picture he ends his Italian period and strikes his own\npersonal note. Both this and the \"Venus asking arms for Aeneas from\nVulcan,\" together with the \"Birth of Adonis\" and the \"Death of\nAdonis,\" of about the same period, still show Boucher strongly under\nthe influence of his master, Lemoyne. Indeed, the \"Birth\" and \"Death\nof Adonis,\" their record lost during the scuffle and confusion of the\nRevolution, for long hung side by side as pictures by Lemoyne, until,\nbeing cleaned about 1860, Boucher's initials were discovered upon\nthem, and, contemporary engravings being hunted up, still further\nproved their origin. But in the Venus that now figures in all his\nworks there is that flesh-painting of the nude, and that rosy touch\nupon the flesh of the female figure, that are a far more certain\nsignature of Boucher's handiwork than any written name.\n\nUnfortunately the Salons were closed during Boucher's earlier years\nuntil he was thirty-four, and the record of his work during these\nyears is difficult to follow; but with his service to Venus his\npersonal career begins, and the stream of his Venus-pieces steadily\nflows from his hands.\n\nHe came to her service rid of all prentice essays in craftsmanship, a\nfinished and consummate artist. He found in his subject a goddess to\nwhom he could devote his great and splendid gifts. He painted her\ndainty body with a radiant delight and a rare colour-sense such as\nFrance had never before seen or uttered. He remains to this day the\nfirst painter of the subtle, delicate, and elusive thing that is\nfemininity; he caught her allure, her charm, as he was to catch the\nfragrance and charm of children and flowers; and he set the statement\nof these things upon canvas as they have never been uttered.\n\nThe whole of his life long, Boucher gave himself up with equal and\npassionate devotion to work and to pleasure--working at his easel\noften twelve hours of his day without losing, to the end when the\nbrush fell from his dead fingers, his blitheness of heart or his\ngenerosity of act, and without weakening the pleasure-loving desires\nof his gadding spirit. Out of his splendid toil he made the means to\nindulge his tastes for pleasure; and the gratifying of his tastes in\nturn renewed and created the ideas that made the subjects of his\nartistry. He brought to all he did a joy in the doing that made of his\nvast labour one long pleasure--of his pleasures a riot of industry. He\nplayed as he toiled, scarce knowing which was play and which toil.\n\nThe gossip of his love-affairs makes no romantic story--they were but\ncommonplace ecstasies with unknown frail women. But hard as he worked\nand lived and played, he found time to get himself married in his\nthirtieth year to pretty seventeen-year-old Marie Jeanne Buseau, a\nlittle Parisian--and for love of her, so far as he understood the\nbusiness; for she brought him no dowry.\n\nThe young couple settled down for the next ten years in the Rue\nSaint-Thomas-du-Louvre. Here Boucher lived through his thirties.\n\nMadame was a pretty creature, if we had but Latour's pastel portrait\nalone to prove it. But the pretty features were the crown to as pretty\na body, for she sat often to her lord; and it is clear from his\ncorrespondence with a friend, Bachaumont, that she is the Psyche of\nhis illustrated fable--and Psyche runs much to the Altogether.\n\nMarriage, however, was not likely to imprison Boucher's gadding eyes;\nand it did not. Madame Boucher seems to have had as frail a heart, and\navoided strife by amusing herself, amongst others, with the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who, to gain access to the lady,\ncommissioned Boucher to do the Watteau-like illustrations to\nAcajou--a dull affair. Boucher's pretty wife, herself no mean\nartist, worked in his studio, and painted several smaller canvases\nafter his pictures, gaining some fame as a miniaturist and engraver.\n\nNor did Marriage turn Boucher from his art. Two years were gone by\nsince his nomination to the Academy; he had now to paint the formal\nHistorical Picture and present it in order to take his seat as\nAcademician; and it was in this his thirtieth year that he painted and\nwon his academic rank with the \"Renauld et Armide\" now at the Louvre.\n\nHere he sufficiently subordinated his own style to the academic to\nensure success; and the work was hailed by Academicians and critics,\nincluding Diderot, with enthusiasm. But even here we have his cupids\npeeping round the mythologic event; and Armide herself has pretty\nFrench lips that knew no Greek.\n\nOnce secure of his position, he straightway flung the last remnants of\nthe academic style out of his studio door; and it is a grim comment on\ncriticism that it was just exactly in proportion as he developed his\nown personal genius and uttered the France of his day, that he was\nattacked; whilst the stilted things that he knew were third-rate, and\nwhich he wholly rejected from henceforth, were exactly the things that\nwere praised!\n\nHis election to the Academy, and the enthusiasm over the picture that\nwon him his seat thereat, brought his name before the young king; the\nfollowing year he received his first order from the Court whose\npainter he was destined to become. The decorations in the queen's\napartments were gloomy and had grown black; and he painted in their\nstead the \"Charity,\" \"Abundance,\" \"Fidelity,\" and \"Prudence\" still\nthere to be seen. Indeed, with his gay vision, his pretty habit of\nculling only the flowers from the garden of life, and his quickness to\nset down the pleasing thing in every prospect, Boucher was the\ndestined painter of a Court weary of pomposity and the pose of the\nmock-heroic, and which was wholly giving itself up to pleasure and the\nelegances.\n\nBut neither his new dignity of Academician nor the royal favour, kept\nhim from the bookshops; and he illustrated, with rare beauty and a\ncharm worthy of Watteau, the great edition of the Works of Moli\u00e8re\nin his thirty-first year. It is true that he made as free with\nMoli\u00e8re's world as with the Gods of Olympus; he peoples the plays with\ncharacters of his own day, arrayed in the dress and habit of that day,\nand moving in surroundings that he saw about him.\n\n\nLE MONDE QUI S'AMUSE\n\n\nThe Homely had come upon the town out of Holland, painted with most\nconsummate artistry by Chardin, and was soon in the vogue. Boucher had\na quick eye for the mode. And he straightway set himself to the\npainting of \"La Belle Cuisini\u00e8re.\" Still-life and homely subjects need\nan accuracy of realism and a Dutch sense of these things, a sense of\nsincerity and an appreciation of the dignity of the work-a-day life of\nthe people, in which Boucher was wholly lacking. Above all, it calls\nfor a sense of \"character,\" which, in Boucher, was always weak. It was\na sneer against him that his very broomsticks called for pompons and\nribbons--and there was more than a little truth in the spite. He is\nmore concerned with the accident of the kissing of a kitchen-maid than\nwith the kitchen's habit. He cannot even peep into a scullery without\ndragging in Venus by the skirts, and tricking her out in a\nproperty-wardrobe of a scullery-wench, in which the girl is clearly\nbut acting the part.\n\nHowever, these passing vogues and experiments in different methods\nwere only gay asides--he was working the while upon his own subjects;\nand, to the display by its several members ordered by the Academy, he\nsent four little paintings of fauns and cupids which won him the\nhonour of election as deputy-professor. His brain and hand were very\nbusy, and he turns from one thing to another with amazing facility,\nbringing distinction to all that he does.\n\nBut he painted about this time two pictures of infants, \"L'Amour\nOiseleur\" and \"L'Amour Moissonneur,\" which were the beginning of that\nhost of cupids that he let fly from his studio; they frolic across his\ncanvases and join the retinue of Venus, peeping out from clouds, over\nwaves, round curtains, painted with a perfection that has never been\nsurpassed in the portrayal of infants. He painted their round limbs,\ntheir lusty life, their delightful awkwardnesses, their jolly fat\ngrace, their na\u00efve surprise at life and glory in it, as they had never\nbeen painted before, and have never been painted since.\n\nHe also gave forth in this his thirty-third year a \"Pastoral\" and a\n\"Shepherd and Shepherdess in Conversation,\" with sheep about them and\nin a pleasant landscape, which were his first essays in the style that\nhe created and which made him famous.\n\nHis friend Meissonnier, the inventor of the rococo, stood godfather to\nBoucher's first-born son in the May of 1736.\n\nFrom the very beginning Boucher seems to have been engraved. And these\nengravings, done by the best gravers of his day, greatly extended his\nreputation and popularised him; he fully realised the value of the\nadvertisement as well as his profits from it. Before his thirty-third\nyear was run out he published his well-known \"Cries of Paris.\"\n\nBoucher's description of them, \"studies from the low classes,\" holds\nthe key to that something of failure to realise the dramatic verities\nthat is over all; it gives also the attitude of the France that he\nknew towards the France that he did not, and could not understand. He\ncreated that dainty, pleasant atmosphere that comes floating up to the\nwindows on a fresh morning in Paris from the musical cries of\nthe street vendors; but of the deeper significance of the\nstreet-sellers--of the miserable accent in their life, of their weary\ntoil, of the dignity of their labour--he knew nothing; his brush could\nnot refrain from making elegance and fine manners peep from behind the\nstreet-porter's fustian or the milkmaid's skirt.\n\nBut his thirty-third year was to contain a more far-reaching\nsignificance even than the creation of his cupid-pieces and pastorals.\n\nThe \"Cries of Paris\" were scarce printed when Boucher's illustration\nto \"Don Quixote\" appeared--\"Sancho pursued by the servants of the\nDuke.\" This design was to have far-reaching results that Boucher\nlittle suspected.\n\nThe painter Oudry had been called to the conduct of the great tapestry\nlooms at Beauvais a couple of years before; and in his efforts to\nfurnish the looms with good designs, he now called Boucher to his aid,\nwhose original and fresh style, colour, and arrangement, together with\nhis personal vision, and the enthusiasm and zeal with which he threw\nhimself into the work, at once increased the reputation and the\nproducts of the famous looms. This large designing for the tapestries\nwas, in return, of immense value to the development of the genius of\nthe man, enlarging his breadth of style and giving scope to that great\ndecorative sense that was his superb gift. Thenceforth he was destined\nto play a supreme part in the history of the world-famed factories. He\nnow produced painting after painting for the Beauvais looms.\n\nLife is now one long triumph for Boucher, only disturbed in this year\nby the sad news of the suicide of his old master, Lemoyne. It was in\nthis, Boucher's thirty-fourth year, that the Salon was opened for the\nfirst time since Boucher's infancy, and he contributed several\ncanvases to it.\n\nRigaud, the old Academician, now close upon eighty, straggling through\nthe great galleries, might well blink and gasp at the change that had\ncome over French art since he last exhibited there, thirty-three years\ngone by; but his scoffs and regrets held no terrors for the younger\nAcademicians gathered about. He stood in a new world. A new generation\nwas in possession. The grand manner, the severe etiquette, formal\nmock-heroics, and solemn pomposity of Louis the Fourteenth were\nvanished, and the Agreeable and the Pleasant Make-Believe of Louis the\nFifteenth reigned in their stead. Old Rigaud might blink indeed! Just\nas the imposing and stilted etiquette of the reception-room had given\nplace to the easy manners and airy etiquette of the dainty boudoir, so\nhad light chatter and gay wit and the quick repartee usurped the heavy\nsplendours of a consequential age. France, weary of an eternal pose of\nthe grand manner, was seeking change in joyousness and amusement.\n\nGallantry and gaiety were become the object of the ambition of a\ndandified and elegant day. France became a coquette; dressed herself\nas a porcelain shepherdess; and with beribboned crook and sheep,\nseeking pleasant prospects to stroll through, gave herself to\ndalliance--her powder-puff and patch-box and fan a serious part of her\nunseriousness.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE CH\u00c2TEAUROUX\n\n\nAt thirty-five Boucher has arrived. He is in the vogue; in favour at\nCourt--as well as in the fashion. In his three years from taking his\nseat at the Academy to the opening of the first Salon he has created a\nnew and original style--his cupid pieces, his pastorals, his\nVenus-pieces, his tapestry. Boucher's kingdom lay in the realm of the\ndecorative painter--and he has found it. Torn from the surroundings\nfor which he designed them, as part and parcel of the general scheme,\nhis pictures are as out of place as an Italian altarpiece in an\nEnglish dining-room, yet they suffer less. Several may still be seen,\nas he set them up in frames of his own planning, as overdoors in the\npalace of the Soubise, now given up to the national archives.\n\nThe ghost of the Prince of Soubise, who commissioned them, may haunt\nhis palace, but his kin know the place no longer. The overdoors\nwrought by Boucher's skill look down now on the nation's collection of\nhistoric documents. The \"Three Graces enchaining Love,\" the fine\npastoral of \"The Cage,\" and the pastoral of the \"Shepherd placing a\nRose in his Shepherdess's Hair,\" were to see a mightier change than\nthe usurpation of Louis the Fourteenth's pompous age by the elegant\nyears of Louis the Fifteenth. But this was not as yet. Here at least\nwe see Boucher's art rid of all outside influences, and at the full\ntide of creation; here we have the inimitable lightness of touch, the\nfigures and landscape bathed in the airy volume of atmosphere.\n\nHe seems at this time to have played with pastel, due probably to his\nfriendship with Latour, who sent a portrait of Boucher's wife to this\nSalon. Boucher showed in the use of chalks the artistry and skill that\nwere always at his command.\n\nHe also was putting to its full use his innate sense of landscape,\nraising to high achievement that astonishing balance of landscape and\nfigures in his design--a balance that has never been surpassed; his\nfigures never override his landscape; his landscape never overpowers\nhis figures. His earnest counsels to his pupils and his constant\ndeploring of the lack of the landscape art in France prove the great\nstress he laid upon it.\n\nThe designing of a frontispiece for the catalogue of a personal\nfriend, one Gersaint, a merchant of oriental wares, started Boucher in\nhis thirty-third year upon that series of Chinese pictures and\ntapestries known as the \"Chinoiseries,\" in which he frittered away\nonly too many precious hours, for they were received with great favour\nby the public. The paintings of Chinese subjects designed for the\nlooms of Beauvais are still to be seen at Besan\u00e7on.\n\nBut busy as were his brain and hand in the exercise of his wide and\nversatile gifts, pouring out \"Chinoiseries,\" illustrations for books,\ntapestries on a large scale, landscapes, models for the gilt bronze\ndecorations of porcelain vases, scheming handsome frames for his\npictures, designing furniture and fans--Boucher was true, above all,\n\"to his goddess,\" and painted the famed \"Birth of Venus,\" which,\nthanks to the Swedish Ambassador's fondness for Madame Boucher, now\nhangs at Stockholm; our amorous Count de Tessin, to be just, seems to\nhave had a rare flair for the artistic--besides artist's wives. It was\non the 15th of April in 1742, the last year of his thirties, that the\nRoyal favour was marked by the grant of a pension of 400 livres\n(double florins) to Boucher with promise of early benefits to follow.\n\nTwo years afterwards it was raised to 600 livres.\n\nThis was the year that he painted the beautiful canvas of \"Diana\nleaving the Bath with one of her Companions,\" now at the Louvre. It\nwas also the year that saw his landscape, the \"Hamlet of Iss\u00e9\" at the\nSalon. This \"Hameau d'Iss\u00e9\" was to be enlarged for the Opera, proving\nhim to be decorator there, where he was arranging waterfalls,\ncascades, and the rest of the pretty business, without staying his\nhand from his art.\n\nAt forty Boucher has come into his kingdom. The ten years of these\nforties were to be a vast triumph for him. He was to produce\nmasterpiece after masterpiece. His art had caught the taste of the\nday. He was at the height of his powers. He had done great things--he\nwas to do greater. During these ten years of his forties he poured\nforth vivid and glowing works of sustained power and originality.\n\nWe have a picture of him as he was in the flesh at this time--the\npastel portrait by Lundberg, now at the Louvre--a gay, somewhat\ndissipated, handsomely dressed dandy of the time, smiling out of his\ncareless day, the debonnair man of fashion, the laughing eyes showing\nsigns of the night carousals, which were the rest from the prodigious\ntoil of this vital and forthright spirit.\n\nIt was in this our artist's fortieth year that the gifted old Cardinal\nFleury, who had guided the fortunes of France with rare skill, died,\nbroken by his ninety years and the blunders of the disastrous war that\nhe had so strenuously opposed; and Louis, essaying the strut of\nkingship, became king by act. His indolent character, unequal to the\nmighty business, his indeterminate will fretted by the set of\nquarrelling and intriguing rogues that he gathered about him as his\nministers, he fell into the habit that became his thenceforth, the\nonly thing to which he paid the tribute of constancy--he ruled France\nfrom behind pretty petticoats. He had early shown the adulterous blood\nof his great-grandfather; two, if not three, of five sisters of the\nnoble and historic house of De Nesle had yielded to his gadding fancy;\nthe youngest now ousted her sister De Mailly from the king's favour,\nwas publicly acknowledged as the king's mistress, and became Duchess\nof Ch\u00e2teauroux. Boucher painted her handsome being as a shepherdess in\none of his pastorals. She was no ordinary toy of a king. A woman of\ntalent, with hot ambitions for the king's majesty, fired with the\npride of race of the old French noblesse, it was during her short\nyears of ascendancy over the king that he roused from his body's\ntorpor and made an effort to reach the dignity and eminence befitting\nto the lord of a great and gallant people. He stepped forth awhile\nfrom his drunken bouts and manifold mean adulteries, and set himself\nat the head of the army in Flanders, and strutted it as conqueror.\n\nPoor Ch\u00e2teauroux only got the hate of the people for reward, Louis the\nhonours; for the people resented the public dishonour of her state.\n\nPower she found to be a dead-sea apple in her pretty mouth. The glory\nof it all, the splendours, were not the easily won delights for which\nshe had looked. She had to fight a duel, that never ended, with the\nking's witty, crafty, and scurrilous Prime Minister, the notorious\nMaurepas--and Maurepas willed that no woman should ever come between\nhim and the king--Maurepas who knew no mercy, no decency, no chivalry,\nno scruple. At Ch\u00e2teauroux's urging, Louis placed himself at the\nhead of the army; and France went near mad with joy that she had\nagain found a king. Crafty Maurepas urged on the business; the\nCh\u00e2teauroux suddenly realised his cunning glee--it separated her from\nthe king.\n\nOut of the whirl of things Boucher's fortune was ripening, little as\nhe might suspect it.\n\nHe was painting masterpieces that make his name live. To his fortieth\nyear belong the famed \"Birth of Venus,\" the \"Venus leaving the Bath,\"\nthe \"Muse Clio,\" the \"Muse Melpomene,\" and the three well-known\npastorals now at the Louvre--\"The Sleeping Shepherdess,\" the \"Nest,\"\n\n\nand the \"Shepherd and Shepherdesses.\" Of the many famous Venus-pieces\nthat his hand painted during these years it is not easy to write the\nlist. But having signed the \"Marriage of Love and Psyche\" at\nforty-one, he turned his experimental hand to the homely, realistic\nDutch style that was having a wide vogue, and painted the\n\"Dejeuner\"--a family of the prosperous class of the day at\nbreakfast--showing with rare charm the surroundings and home life of\nthe well-to-do of his time.\n\nAll goes well with Boucher. He changes into better quarters in the Rue\nde Grenelle-Saint-Honor\u00e9, where he lived for the next five years,\nuntil 1749; but his eyes are fixed upon a studio and apartments at\nthe old palace of the Louvre, though the hard intriguing of his\npowerful friends at Court on his behalf failed for some time. He had,\nindeed, to make another move before he arrived at his longed-for goal.\n\nPensions Boucher, like others, had found to be somewhat empty affairs;\nbut rooms at the Louvre were a solid possession eagerly sought after\nby the artists.\n\nIn this year of 1744 Boucher created a new fashion at the annual Salon\nby sending studies and sketches instead of finished pictures; and it\nset a value upon such things not before realised by artists, for\nsuccess was instant and loud.\n\nTowards the end of the next, Boucher's forty-second year, the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who was to take his leave of Paris,\ncommissioned four pictures to represent the day of a woman of fashion,\nand to be entitled \"Morning,\" \"Midday,\" \"Evening,\" and \"Night.\"\n\nBoucher painted one of these for him, now known as the \"Marchande de\nModes.\" The others were painted later, and all had a wide vogue as\nengravings. The correspondence has interest since it reveals Boucher's\nbusiness habits; he was paid for a picture on its delivery, and for\neach of these he was to receive 600 livres (double florins or\ndollars)--about a hundred and twenty pounds.\n\nIn an official document of the Director of Buildings to the king (or\nMinister of Fine Art, as we should say), written in this year of 1745,\nBoucher being forty-two, is a \"list of the best painters,\" in which\nBoucher is singled out for distinction as \"an historic painter, living\nin the Rue de Grenelle-Saint-Honor\u00e9, opposite the Rue des Deux-Ecus,\npupil of Lemoyne, excelling also in landscape, grotesques, and\nornaments in the manner of Watteau; and equally skilled in painting\nflowers, fruit, architecture, and subjects of gallantry and of\nfashion.\"\n\nNot so bad for dry officialdom; the critics could learn a lesson. For\nhe was nothing less. What indeed does he not do? and wondrous well!\nthis painter of the age.\n\nAnd the mighty rush of events is about to sweep him into further\nprominence; the very things which he probably passed by with a gay\nshrug are to enrich him, to help him to his highest fulfilment.\n\nPoor Ch\u00e2teauroux saw that she must lose the king's gadding favour in\nthe conflict with Maurepas unless she joined her lord, now with the\narmy. She realised full well that she had created the new Louis of\nAmbition--that her going must bring the people's hate to her. But she\ndared not lose the king. And she went. Maurepas had overdone his\njibings. The indiscretion at once rang through the land; became the\njest of the army--and Maurepas was not far from the bottom of the\nbusiness. The discreet indiscretion of covered ways between the king's\nlodgings and hers only added to the mockeries, and increased the\npeople's hate against, of course, the Ch\u00e2teauroux. Then upon a day in\nAugust the small-pox seized Louis at Metz; poor Ch\u00e2teauroux fought for\npossession of the king in the sick room, until his fear of\ndeath--Louis' sole piety--sent her packing--shrinking back in the\nhired carriage at each halting-place for change of horses, lest she\nshould be seen and torn from her place and destroyed by the populace.\n\nBut Louis recovered; Paris rang with bells at joy on his recovery, and\nhe entered the city amidst mad enthusiasm, hailed as The Well-Beloved.\n\nHe sent for the Ch\u00e2teauroux to find her dying, Maurepas having to\ndeliver the message of recall. She died suddenly and in great agony,\nswearing that Maurepas had poisoned her--died in the arms of her poor\ndiscarded sister, the De Mailly.\n\nBut this year of 1745 Boucher hears a mightier scandal that is to mean\nvast things to all France--and not least of all to Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE POMPADOUR\n\n\nA young bride had become the gossip of the rich merchant society of\nParis--that class that was ousting the old noblesse from power. She\nwas a beautiful, a remarkable woman; her wit was repeated in the\ndrawing-rooms, she had all the accomplishments; her charming\nname--Madame Lenormant d'Etioles.\n\nDraw aside the curtains of the past and we discover our little Jeanne\nPoisson--grown into this exquisite creature. It has come about in\nstrange fashion enough. The father--a scandalous fellow--having\nfingered the commissariat moneys in ugly ways to his own use, had been\nbanished for the ugly business. Nor is Jeanne's mother any better than\nshe should be; and the wags wink knowingly at the handsome and rich\nman of fashion, Monsieur Lenormant de Tournehem, who has been the\nfavoured gallant during the absence of the light-fingered Poisson.\n\nAnd, of a truth, Lenormant de Tournehem takes astonishing interest in\nthe little Jeanne--watching over her up-growing and giving her the\nbest of education at the convent, where she wins all hearts, and is\nknown as \"the little queen.\" The truth spoken with wondrous prophecy,\nif unthinkingly, as we shall see. Complacent Poisson came home, and\ntook the rich and fashionable, bland and smiling Lenormant de\nTournehem to his arms. Has he not wealth and estates? therefore as\nexcellent a friend for Poisson as for Madame Poisson. The girl Jeanne\nleaves the convent to be taught the accomplishments by the supreme\nmasters of France, the wits foregather at Madame Poisson's, and the\nbrilliant Jeanne is soon mistress of the arts--coquetry not least of\nall; has also the most exquisite taste in dress. Under all is a heart\ncold as steel; calculating as the higher mathematics. She has but one\nhindrance to ambition--her mean birth. Lenormant de Tournehem rids her\neven of this slur by making his nephew, Lenormant d'Etioles, marry\nher, giving the young couple half his fortune for dowry, and the\npromise of the rest when he dies--also he grants him a splendid\ntown-house, as splendid a country seat. And consequential\nself-respecting little Lenormant d'Etioles is lord of Etioles, amongst\nother seignories. So Jane Fish appears as Madame Lenormant d'Etioles,\nseductive, beautiful, accomplished, to whose house repair the new\nphilosophy, the wits, and artists. She has a certain sense of virtue;\nindeed openly vows that no one but the king shall ever come between\nher and her lord. But, deep in her heart, she has harboured a fierce\nambition--that the king shall help her to keep her bond. She puts\nforth all her gifts, all her powers, to win to the strange goal;\nconfides it to her worldly mother and \"uncle,\" Lenormant de Tournehem;\nfinds keen allies therein to the reaching of that strange goal. The\ndeath of the Ch\u00e2teauroux clears the way. At a masked ball the king is\nintrigued as to the personality of a beautiful woman who plagues him\nwith her art; he orders the unmasking. Madame Lenormant d'Etioles\nstands revealed, drops her handkerchief as by accident; the whisper\nruns through the Court that \"the handkerchief has been thrown!\" The\nking stoops and picks it up. A few evenings later she is smuggled into\nthe \"private apartments.\" She goes again a month later; in the morning\nis seized with sudden terror--she daren't go back to her angry lord\nlest he do her grievous harm; he will have missed her. The king is\ntouched; allows her to hide from henceforth in the secret apartments;\npromises the beautiful creature a lodging, her husband's banishment,\nand early acknowledgment as titular mistress--before the whole Court\nat Easter, says the pious Great One. But he has to join the army to\nplay the Conqueror at Fontenoy; and it is later in the year\n(September) before Madame d'Etioles is presented to the Court in a\nvast company and proceeds to the queen's apartments to kiss hands on\nappointment. Thus was Jeanne Poisson raised to the great aristocracy\nof France in her twenty-third year as Marquise de Pompadour.\n\nBoucher had been one of the brilliant group of artists of the\nd'Etioles' circle. That the Pompadour's influence had much effect upon\nhis position at Court for a year or two is unlikely; for she had to\nfight for possession of the king day and night, as the Ch\u00e2teauroux\nhad done, against the queen's party and the unscrupulous enmity of\nMaurepas. To set down Boucher's favour at Court to her is ridiculous.\n\nHe was painting for the queen's apartments at thirty-one when the\nPompadour was a school-girl of twelve. But in the year following her\nrise to power, Boucher painted four pictures for the large room of the\nDauphin, which were \"placed elsewhere\"; and, the year after that, he\nwas at work upon two pictures for the bedroom of the king at the\ncastle of Marly. It is likely enough that the Pompadour directed this\norder. She had almost immediately secured the office of the\nDirector-General of Buildings, which covered the direction of the\nroyal art treasures, for \"uncle\" Lenormant de Tournehem, who was also\na friend of the artist. And from this year it is significant that\nBoucher paints no more for the opposing camp of the Queen and Dauphin.\n\nHe was now giving all his strength to the \"Rape of Europa\" that he\npainted for the competition ordered by the Academy at the command of\nLenormant de Tournehem in the king's name, in which ten chosen\nAcademicians were to paint subjects in their own style for six prizes\nand a gold medal, to be awarded in secret vote by the competing\nartists themselves. Boucher won, by his amiable nature, the good-will\nof them all by proposing that they should so arrange as to share the\nprizes equally, and thus prevent any sense of soreness inevitable in\nthe losers.\n\nBut greatly as he won the good-fellowship of his fellow-artists by it,\nthis picture caused a murmur to rise amongst the critics who,\naforetime loud in his praise, now began to complain of his \"abuse of\nrose tints\" in the painting of the female nude. The fact was that\nDiderot and the men of the New Philosophy were turning their eyes to\nthe whole foundations upon which France was built, art as well as\nsociety, and were beginning to demand of art \"grandeur and morality in\nits subjects.\" They were soon to be clamouring for \"the statement of a\ngreat maxim, a lesson for the spectator.\" Diderot, with bull-like\ncourage, picked out the greatest, and turned upon Boucher, blaming him\nfor triviality.\n\nThe nations, weary of war, concluded the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in\nthe October of 1748. No sooner was peace concluded than Louis\nrelapsed into his old habit of dandified indolence and profligate\nease; and, putting from him his duties as the lord of a great people,\nhe gave himself up to shameless intrigues. He allowed the Pompadour to\nusurp his magnificence and to rule over the land. He yielded himself\nutterly, if sometimes sulkily, to her domination; and for sixteen\nyears she was the most powerful person at Court, the greatest force in\nthe state--making and unmaking ministers, disposing of office,\nhonours, titles, pensions. All political affairs were discussed and\narranged under her guidance; ministers, ambassadors, generals\ntransacted their business in her stately boudoirs; the whole patronage\nof the sovereign was dispensed by her pretty hands; the prizes of the\nChurch, of the army, of the magistracy could be obtained solely\nthrough her favour and good-will. Her energy must have been\nprodigious. Possessed of extraordinary talents and exquisite tastes,\nshe gave full rein to them, and it was in the indulgence of her better\nqualities that Destiny brought Boucher into the friendship of this\nwonderful woman. She became not only his patron but his pupil,\nengraving several of his designs.\n\nBut this, her sovereignty over the king, easy and light in its outward\nseeming, was a haggard nightmare to the calculating woman who had so\nlonged for it. She knew no single hour's rest from the night she won\nto the king's bed. She had to fight her enemies, secret and open, for\npossession of the king's will, day and night; and she fought--with\nrare courage. She won by consummate skill and unending pluck. She made\nherself an essential part of the king's freedom from care. The Court\nparty fought her for power with constant vigilance. Maurepas brought\nall his unscrupulous art, all his ironic mimicry, all his vile jibes\nand unchivalrous hatred to bear against her. He had made himself a\nnecessity to the king; and he never slept away a chance of injuring\nher. He knew no mercy, no nobility, no pity. He made her the detested\nobject of the people. With his own hands he penned the witty verses\nand epigrams that were sung and flung about the streets of Paris.\n\nBut she had an enemy more subtle than any at the Court--hour by hour\nshe had to dispute the king with the king's boredom. And it was in the\neffort to do so that she created her celebrated theatre in the\nprivate apartments, calling Boucher and others to her aid in the doing\nof it. Here the noblest of France vied with each other to obtain the\nsmallest part to play, an instrument in its orchestra, an invitation\nto its performances.\n\nBoucher left the Opera to become its decorator in 1748, and did not\nreturn until her death. For her, he also decorated her beautiful rooms\nat Bellevue. She bought at high prices many of his greatest\nmasterpieces.\n\nThe Pompadour's power so greatly increased that she openly took\ncommand of the king's will; dared and succeeded in getting his\nfavourite Maurepas banished; and herself took to the use of the kingly\n\"we.\" Her rascally father was created Lord of Marigny; her brother,\nwhom the king liked well and called \"little brother,\" was created\nMarquis de Vandi\u00e8res; her only child, Alexandrine, signed her name as\na princess of the blood royal, and would have been married to the\nblood royal had she not caught the small-pox and died. She amassed a\nprivate fortune, castles, and estates such as no mistress had dreamed\nof; and into them she poured art treasures that cost the nation\nthirty-six millions of money. She created the porcelain factory of\nS\u00e8vres, kept keen watch over the Gobelins looms, and founded the great\nMilitary School of St. Cyr amidst work that would have kept several\nstatesmen busy, and of deadly intrigues at Court that would have\nbroken the spirit of many a brilliant man.\n\nIt was in her hectic desire to keep the king from being bored that she\nstooped, and made Boucher stoop, to the employment of his high\nartistry in the painting of a series of indecent pictures wherewith to\ntickle the jaded desires of Boredom, and thereby gave rise to the\nwidespread impression that Boucher's art was ever infected by base\ndesign. But Boucher was, at his very worst, but a healthy animal; and\neven in these secret works for the king he did not reach so low as did\nmany an artist of more pious memory who painted with no excuse but his\nown pleasure.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the Pompadour has been blamed too much for this\nevil act, and too much forgotten for her splendid patronage of the man\nwho, under it and during these great years of his forties, produced a\nseries of masterpieces that place him in the foremost rank of the\npainters of his century. It is impossible to reckon the number of the\npastorals and Venus-pieces that his master-hand painted and loved to\npaint, during these the supreme years of his genius. It is significant\nthat they were painted during the years that saw the Pompadour in\nsupreme power.\n\nBoucher was so firmly established in 1750, his forty-seventh year,\nthat he moved into a new house in the Rue Richelieu, near the Palais\nRoyal. Disappointed in not receiving a studio and apartments at the\nLouvre, he was allowed to use a studio in the king's library. He was\nnow making money so easily that he was able to collect pictures and\nprecious stones and the gaily coloured curiosities that appealed to\nhis tastes.\n\nThe critics were becoming more and more censorious; and one of them\nhits true with the comment that in his pastorals his shepherdesses\nlook as if they had stepped over from the Opera and would soon be off\nagain thereto.\n\nIn his forty-eighth year Boucher's art was at its most luminous\nstage--his atmosphere clear and subtle and exquisitely rendered; his\nyellows golden; his whites satin-like and silvery; his flesh-tones\nupon the nude bodies of his goddesses unsurpassed by previous art. The\nbeauty of it all was not to last much longer.\n\nLenormant de Tournehem died suddenly in the November of 1751; the\nPompadour's brother, Abel Poisson de Vandi\u00e8res, was appointed\nDirector-General in his stead at the age of twenty-five--and soon\nafterwards, on the death of his father, created Marquis de Marigny--a\nshy, handsome youth, a gentleman and an honourable fellow, whom the\nking liked well, and against whom his sister's sole complaint was that\nhe lacked the brazen effrontery of the courtiers of the day. No man\ndid more for the advancement of the art of his time. A pension of a\nthousand livres falling vacant, the young fellow secured it for\nBoucher; and almost immediately afterwards, a studio becoming vacant\nat the Louvre owing to the death of Coypel, first painter to the king,\nBoucher came to his coveted home, eagerly moving in with his family as\nsoon as its wretched state could be put into repair.\n\nThe decoration of the new wing to the palace at Fontainebleau brought\nthe commission for the painting of the ceiling and the principal\npicture in the Council Chamber to Boucher, who had already decorated\nthe Dining-Room. This was the period of his painting the \"Rising\" and\nthe \"Setting of the Sun\" for the Pompadour, now in the Watteau\ncollection, two canvases that were always favourites with the painter,\nbitterly as they were assailed by the critic Grimm.\n\nHe was turning out so much work that it was impossible to give as much\ncare to his pictures as he ought. For he refused sternly, his life\nlong, to raise his prices; by consequence he had to create a larger\namount of work in order to meet his expenditure. It was about this\ntime that Reynolds, passing through Paris, went to visit him and found\nhim painting on a huge canvas without models or sketches. \"On\nexpressing my surprise,\" writes Reynolds, \"he replied that he had\nconsidered the model as necessary during his youth until he had\ncompleted his study of art, but that he had not used one for a long\ntime past.\"\n\nHe soon had not the time, not only to paint from nature but even to\ngive his pictures the work necessary to complete them. The feverish\nhaste which took possession of him in his frantic endeavour to meet\nthe vast demand for his pictures, and the eager efforts of his\nengravers to satisfy the public call for engravings after his works,\ngave him less and less leisure to joy in their doing. And his eyesight\nbegan to fail. His flesh-tints deepened to a reddish hue; and he\nstands baffled before his work, suspecting his sight, since what every\none cries out upon as being bright vermilion, he only sees as a dull\nearthy colour. Boucher has topped the height of his achievement; he\nhas to \"descend the other side of the hill.\" Boucher begins to grow\nold.\n\nIn Boucher's fifty-first year an ugly intrigue of the queen's party at\nCourt to sap the Pompadour's influence over the king by drawing away\nthe king's affections towards Madame de Choiseul-Romanet, a reckless\nyoung beauty of the Court, brought about a strange alliance. The Count\nde Stainville, one of the Pompadour's bitterest enemies, was shown the\nking's letter of invitation to his young kinswoman; and he, deeply\nwounded in his pride that his kinswoman should have been offered to\nthe king, went to the Pompadour and exposed the plot. A close\nalliance followed; and De Stainville thenceforth became her chief\nguide in affairs of state. It was at her instance that the king called\nhim to be his Prime Minister, raising him to the Duchy of Choiseul--a\nname he made illustrious as one of the greatest Ministers of France.\n\nIn his fifty-second year Boucher was appointed to the directorship of\nthe Gobelins looms, to the huge delight of the weavers and all\nconcerned with the tapestry factory. This was the year of his painting\nthe famous portrait of the Pompadour, to whom he several times paid\nthis \"tribute of immorality.\" For the Gobelins looms he produced many\nhandsome designs; and he was painting with astounding industry. But\nhis hand's skill began to falter. His art shows weariness in his\nsixtieth year, and sickness fell upon him, and held him in servitude\nnow with rare moments of respite. The critics, notoriously Diderot,\nwere now attacking him with shameless virulence. Boucher passed it all\nby; but he felt the change that was taking place in the public taste.\n\nThe ideas of the New Philosophy were infecting public opinion; the Man\nof Feeling had arisen in the land; and France, humiliated in war, and\nresenting the follies and the greed of her shameless privileged class,\nwas openly resenting it and all its works. Choiseul had planted his\nstrength deep in the people's party, and was come near to being its\ngod. His masterly mind had checked Frederick of Prussia to the North;\nand the nations, exhausted by the struggle, signed the Peace of Paris\nin 1763. Choiseul, with France at peace abroad, turned to the blotting\nout of the turbulent order of the Jesuits at home. Their attempt to\nend the Pompadour's relations with the king made this powerful woman\neager to complete his design; the chance was soon to come, and the\nOrder was abolished from France and its vast property seized by the\nstate.\n\nThe Pompadour lived but a short while to enjoy her triumph. Worn out\nby her superhuman activities, assailed by debt, she fell ill of a\nracking cough, dying on the 15th of April, 1764, in her forty-second\nyear, keeping her ascendancy over the king and the supreme power in\nFrance to her last hour. Death found her transacting affairs of state.\n\nLouis, weary of his servitude, had only a heartless epigram to cast\nat the body of the dead woman as she passed to her last resting-place.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE END\n\n\nThe death of the Pompadour robbed Boucher of a friend; but her\nbrother, Marigny, remained faithfully attached to the old artist, and\nseized every chance to honour him. On the death of Carle van Loo,\nBoucher, at sixty-two, was made first painter to the king, with all\nhis pensions and privileges that were consistent with this the supreme\nappointment in the art world.\n\nThere had been serious intention of making Boucher the head of the\nEcole des El\u00e8ves Proteg\u00e9s; he had the art of making himself liked and\nof inspiring the love of the arts. He was very popular with the\nstudents and artists, owing to his kindliness, his eagerness to render\nservice, his readiness to encourage the youngsters or to console them.\n\nWhen the riot took place, provoked by the Academicians by their award\nof the Prix de Rome in 1767, the students insulted the Academicians,\nbut hailed Boucher with enthusiastic applause. The reason was not far\nto seek. When a student came to the old master for advice he did not\n\"play the pontiff,\" and, scorning the false dignity of big phrases, he\ntook the brush in his hand and showed the way out of all difficulties\nby simplehearted example, despising rules, and putting himself out in\norder to make things clear to a young artist.\n\nHowever, the Academicians feared he would be an unorthodox master for\nyouth, and appointed another in his place.\n\nA long and serious illness thwarted his keen energies. Diderot was\ngiving himself up to outrageous violence against him. If the old\npainter exhibited at the Salon, Diderot fiercely assailed his art; if\nhe did not exhibit, Diderot as bitterly assailed him for his\nnegligences. Above all, he attacked Boucher in that he did not paint\nwhat Diderot would have painted--but could not. \"When he paints\ninfants,\" cries Diderot, \"you will not find one employed in a real act\nof life--studying his lesson, reading, writing, stripping hemp.\"\n\nPoor unfortunate infants! for whom Philosophy could find no happier\njoy in life than stripping hemp! Boucher was but an artist. He\npainted his generation as far as he could see it, and, with all his\nfaults and weaknesses, he never debauched his art with foreign and\nalien things that had no part in the nation's life; he painted fair\nFrance into his landscapes, not a make-believe land he did not know\nwith preposterous Greek ruins; and best of all, to his eternal honour,\nhe painted infants glad in their gladness to be alive, with no desire\nto send their happy little bodies to school, with no sickly ambition\nto make them into budding philosophers, with no thought of making them\npose and lie as Men of Feeling. He had no joy in setting their little\nbodies to toil--in making them \"teach a lesson to the spectator,\" in\nmaking them stoop their little shoulders to the \"picking of hemp.\"\n\nHe continued to paint as he had always painted--except that he painted\nless well. The wreath of roses was wilting on a grey head. The blood\njigged less warmly in the frail body. The features showed pallid--the\neyes haggard. The sight failed. The hand alone kept something of its\ncunning.\n\nHe went to Holland with his friend Randon du Boisset, but health\nshrank farther from him. Diderot had near spent his last jibe.\n\nIn 1768, Boucher's sixty-fifth year, the neglected queen went to her\ngrave. The king's grief and contrition and vows to amend his life came\ntoo late, and lasted little longer than the drying of the floods of\ntears over the body of his dead consort. A year later he was become\nthe creature of a pretty woman of the gutters, whom he caused to be\nmarried to the Count du Barry--the infamously famous Madame du Barry.\n\nBut neither the remonstrances of Choiseul with the king against this\nfurther degradation of the throne of France, nor his unconcealed scorn\nof the upstart countess, nor the dangerous enemy he made for himself\nthereby, signified now to Boucher, first painter to the king.\n\nBoucher was failing. His son was a prig and a disappointment. His two\nfavourite pupils, Baudoin and Deshayes, who had married his two girls,\ndied.\n\nTo the Salon of 1769 he sent his \"Caravan of Bohemians.\" It was his\nlast display. He had been going about for some time like a gaunt ghost\nof his former self, afflicted with all the ills inevitable to a life\nfeverishly consumed in work and the pursuit of pleasure.\n\nThey went to his studio at five of the clock one May morning, and\nfound him seated at his easel, before a canvas of Venus, dead, with\nthe paint-filled brush fallen out of his fingers.\n\nSo passed he away on the 30th of May 1770, in his sixty-seventh year.\n\nWhen Boucher died, the generation of which he was the limner was near\ncome to its violent end. The rosy carnivals and gay gallantries of his\nage gave way to the blood-stained romance and fierce tempest of the\nRevolution. The garrets of the old curiosity-shops received the\ndiscarded canvases of the master. His shepherds and shepherdesses were\nput to rout by the Romans of his pupil, citizen David. The old order\nwas brought into contempt and overthrown. And with it, Boucher's art,\nlike much that was gracious and charming and good in the evil thing,\nwent down also, and was overwhelmed for a while.\n\nFor a while only. For just as, out of the blood and terror of the\nRevolution, a real France arose, phnix-wise, from the ruin, and in\nbeing born, whilst putting off the vilenesses of the thing from which\nshe sprang, took on also to herself the gracious and winsome qualities\nthat place her amongst the most fascinating peoples of the ages; so\nBoucher has come into his kingdom again--the most gracious of painters\nthat the years have yielded."

                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n        a. One bed, or folding cot,\n        b. One oil stove,\n        c. One lamp,\n        d. Enough supplies of all kinds sufficient for six months,\n        e. Pots, pans, kettles, etc.\nIt is needless to say that positions in Manila and Iloilo were now at\na premium.\n\nWas it possible that teachers were to be sent to places where even the\nnecessaries of life could not be obtained! Was it possible that many\nwould be sent to places so remote that for six months no fresh\nsupplies could be gotten! A mass meeting was held at once, and a\ncommittee was appointed to send a cablegram to the Associated Press\npetitioning aid from the American people at large. Realizing what\nconsternation would be created throughout the United States by such a\nmessage, two of the teachers leaped into a carriage at the close of\nthe meeting and a few moments later were closeted with the chief\nexecutive of the department. As a result the committee was persuaded\nnot to send the cablegram to the Associated Press until by courtesy it\nhad been sent to the President. Of course, this diplomatic move tided\naffairs over and the teachers who had flatly refused to budge from\nManila now agreed to go on to their stations, being assured that\nwhatever action was best would be taken.\n\nThe day had come when we must separate. We were to enter an untried\nand an unknown field. It was fitting that we have a final joyous\nmeeting, so the best orchestra in the archipelago was engaged and we\n\"chased the hours with flying feet\" until dawn so that whatever might\ncome to us in that unknown future upon which we were entering each\nwould hold in pleasant memory our last evening together.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER III. - A DRAMA IN ACTUAL LIFE.\n\n\nAlmost every one heeded the warning to go to his station forearmed\nwith at least necessaries of life, but, as it had never fallen to the\nlot of the writer to cook, he refused to learn at that late day, so he\ntook no pot, no pan, no kettle, putting his future into the hands of\nan uncertain fate and relying upon the unknown hospitality of the\nFilipino.\n\nBacalod, the capital of the province of Occidental Negros, was our\ndestination. The second morning after leaving Manila, we awoke with\nthe \"Kilpatrick\" lying at anchor in a shallow bay. We were several\nmiles from the shore and nothing in sight indicated that we had\nreached a place of any importance. Late the night before we had been\nawakened by the loud, sharp ringing of the ship's bells, accompanied\nby the reversal of the engines and a general disturbance awaking the\ncrew. So our first impressions on coming on deck were that we had run\naground. But the captain assured us that everything was ship-shape and\nthat this was the nearest point of approach to Capiz, a town of\nconsiderable importance on the island of Panay, where a body of troops\nwas to embark for home. Not even the grass hut of a native was in\nsight. Search as we would, not a sign was seen of a stream flowing\ninto the sea, indicating the probable presence of a town. There was\nnot a sign of life of any kind save one lone column of thin, blue\nsmoke that arose from the side of a mountain miles away. One would\nhave thought that we were explorers of three hundred years ago lying\noff the shore of some unknown land.\n\nAfter breakfast the steam launch, together with all the boats, was\nlowered, and several of us who had determined to miss no opportunity\nto gather information about the islands took our places in the launch\nby the side of the ship's mate, and steamed away across the water with\na long line of boats strung out in the rear. We headed away toward a\ngroup of cocoanut trees, and about an hour later stepped ashore on a\npile of decayed coral rocks that extended some twenty or thirty feet\nout into the water, thus forming the only landing place of a town of\nseveral thousands of people and of considerable commercial importance.\n\nA few moments after we had landed, an army wagon drawn by a\nmagnificent pair of mules came up out of a tropical jungle along a\nnarrow road. We clambered into the wagon and were soon lost in the\ndepths of foliage from which we had just seen the vehicle emerge.\n\nLong waving bamboos with their plumy leafage hung over the road from\neach side, meeting and overlapping in the center until they formed an\narchway so dense that the tropical sun now high in the heavens\npenetrated it only at intervals. At times the wagon sank up to the\nhubs in the soft earth, and the muscles of the mules stood out like\nwhip-cords under the skin as they drew us forward.\n\nAt a sharp turn in the road we came upon the first division of troops\nthat was to embark for home. The look of joy upon their sun-browned\nfaces was inexpressible. Their work was done, and with elastic step\nand smiling faces they saluted us as they passed by. The reign of\nforce was at an end; it was going out with them; the reign of peace\nhad begun; it was coming in with us.\n\nIn the afternoon when we returned from the town the last of the troops\nhad arrived and, as we drove up, the bugle was sounding the call to\nsupper. We noticed native women mingling with the troops and, indeed,\na native woman was in constant attention waiting upon one of the\nsoldiers with whom we ate. Her clothes were clean, her hair was nicely\ncombed, and her general appearance was neat. She seemed to anticipate\nthe slightest wish of the soldier with whom she was. She brought him\nwater to drink, cleaned his plate after the meal and saw that his\nknife, fork, and spoon were put into his haversack.\n\nWe had now finished supper and the launch had returned for the last\nload of troops. The lieutenant in command of the company gave the\norder to \"fall in\"; the men shouldered their rifles and fell into\nline. \"Forward, march!\" called the lieutenant, and the column swept\nforward towards the boats. The women had until now restrained\nthemselves, but, as their husbands marched away never to return, their\nfeelings could no longer be restrained. One young woman of about\neighteen, who was leaning against a rock by the roadside sobbing, when\nher husband passed, leaped up in frenzy of passionate love and caught\nthe rifle from his shoulder. Her first impulse seemed to be to throw\nthe gun away, but suddenly realizing the futility of such an act she\nburst into tears, shouldered the rifle herself and marched on by his\nside. Another woman of more mature age threw her arms around the legs\nof a tall stalwart man, and drew him bodily from the line.\n\nBut the troops marched on and entered the boats. One woman who had\nbeen unnoticed before came down into the shallow water and caught hold\nof our last boat as if to prevent its leaving, while others stood\nmingling their sobs with the sounds of the wavelets as they broke on\nthe sands. As we passed away, an expectant mother, standing in bold\noutline against the twilight sky, threw up her hands in an agony of\ndespair and then sank upon the stones. The curtain had fallen upon a\ndrama in actual life deeper in pathos than any other we had ever seen\nor ever expected to see. Depth of passion, depth of love! Who can\nfathom the human heart?\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. - WHAT THE TEACHERS DID.\n\n\nThere is a remarkable sameness about the towns in the Philippines.\n\nThey all have a large open square about the middle of the town, around\nthree sides of which are Chinese stores, unless one side lies open to\nthe sea, and on the fourth is the great stone ecclesia. The streets\nrun at right angles to one another and divide up the town into\ncreditable squares.\n\nEverybody in the Philippines lives up-stairs, for the ground is so\nsoaked with water during the rainy season that it is a menace to\nhealth to live upon the ground floor. So even the poorest nippa hut\nis built upon stakes four or five feet above the ground.\n\nBacalod is a typical Philippine town. As we landed, a broad open\nsquare was spread out before us. Two sides of the square were lined\nwith two-story houses in which were Chinese stores below and Filipino\nhomes above. On the third side stood the great stone church in whose\nmassive tower the clock was striking the hour of four, while the\nfourth lay open to the sea that had borne us thither.\n\nWe landed, but it was in a method new to us and one not usually\nemployed by the traveling public.\n\nWhen our sail boat ran aground on the sandy bottom a hundred yards or\nmore from the shore, a crowd of Filipino men who were on the beach\nslowly rolled up their pantaloons and waded out to the rescue,--for\nthe money that was in it. The boat's crew elevated their trousers'\nlegs also and slided down into the water. Each of us then straddled\nthe neck of a Filipino standing in the water and was held by ankles to\nbe steadied while our biped mounts proceeded to the shore.\n\nWe were now on the ground and face to face with the situation. To give\nthe reader an idea of the actual conditions met by the first teachers\nwho went to the Islands, the following is copied from the instructions\ngiven us in Manila:\n    1. There shall be two sessions daily of all schools, and the\n    last hour of the morning session shall be devoted solely to\n    instructing the Filipino teachers.\n\n    2. In cases where teachers are sent to a town in which there\n    is no school-house, they are expected to secure the aid of the\n    people and have one built.\n\n    3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is\n    stopped.\n\n    4. All supplies must be kept under lock and key. In towns\n    where there is no case or box to lock the supplies in, and it\n    is also impossible to get the town council to furnish a case,\n    a requisition may be sent to Manila, and, if an appropriation\n    can be secured, one will be made and sent out.\n\nThus it can be easily seen that we were indeed pioneers. In many\nplaces no school-house was to be found, and in some cases it was even\ndifficult to get the town council to provide a case in which to keep\nthe supplies.\n\nThe work of the teachers was, in short; to \"make the English language\nthe basis of instruction in the public schools.\" On our arrival at\nBacalod two schools were found in progress, for some soldiers had been\ndetailed for the work here previous to our coming. One of these was\nfor boys and the other, for girls. Thus the work here had been in a\nmeasure simplified, but complications that had arisen at Talisay, one\nof the largest and richest towns on the island, demanded a change of\nteachers and the writer was assigned to the place as superintendent.\n\nHere an attempt had been made to start a school but it had failed\nignominiously and a system of education was to be put into operation\nfrom the very start.\n\nThe Filipinos are not strong advocates of co-education, so separate\nschools were to be started for the boys and the girls. The one for the\nboys was gotten well in hand before the one for the girls was\nattempted at all.\n\nA few days after reaching the town and securing a home the\npresidente of the town had it publicly announced that the following\nMonday morning at eight o'clock a public school for boys would be\nopened in a building that had been rented for the purpose by the\nmunicipal council. About the middle of the afternoon of the same day a\nman beat a little drum throughout all the streets of the town to call\nthe people out and the town clerk announced both in Spanish and in the\nnative language that this public school would begin at the time and\nplace mentioned above; that instruction would be free to all who came;\nthat the government would furnish all supplies; and that instruction\nwould be given in the English language. A native principal and\nassistants were employed and everything was ready to begin.\n\nThe official report of the result is as follows:\n    Boys' public school of Talisay, Negros, P. I., began November\n    4, 1901. Forty-three boys present at eight o'clock. Forty-one\n    of them knew \"good morning\" and \"good afternoon\" but do not\n    know the distinction between them. Two of them speak simple\n    Spanish. At eight forty-five, eight more, who had been\n    attending an early morning private school, came in together.\n\n    The books they brought were so varied and so different from\n    one another that it seemed impossible to bring any reasonable\n    degree of order out of such a chaos, and so, after struggling\n    vainly for about a week with the problem, the superintendent\n    by one fell stroke removed everything in use and put in a\n    uniform system, and from that day on the English language has\n    been the basis of instruction in the public schools of\n    Talisay. The work was of necessity very slow at first, but by\n    the end of a year two schools were going nicely and a number\n    of the brightest boys and girls had made really excellent\n    progress.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER V. - A \"BAILE.\"\n\n\nNot long after the arrival of our party at Bacalod we received an\ninvitation to a \"baile\" given in our honor by the inhabitants of\nSilay, a town some ten or twelve miles up the northern coast and one\nnoted for its social life. The invitation was accepted with pleasure,\nand about the middle of the afternoon on the day appointed we were\nclad in the immaculate white of the tropics and steaming away up the\ncoast on board a launch sent for our conveyance. Twilight was still\nlingering on the path of day when we anchored just off shore at the\ntown. A row-boat containing the officials of the city came out to meet\nus and, in due season, we were ushered into a spacious drawing-room\nfilled almost to overflowing with the \u00e9lite of the town. The \u00e9lite of\ntowns in the Philippines speak Spanish, and, as only one or two of our\nparty could at that time boast of more than a formal acquaintance with\nthe Castilian tongue, the exchange of ideas that evening between us\nand the Filipinos was of necessity not very rapid.\n\nThe necessity of easy communication between us was rendered somewhat\nless indispensable by the announcement of supper as soon as we were\nrested from our trip. When we had taken our places at the table a\nyoung Filipino about twenty-five years of age arose and gave a lengthy\ntoast to the recent union of the Philippines with the United States.\n\nBut as we Americans were unable to scale the dizzy heights of his\nclimaxes or sink to the depths of his pathos, we forewent the\npleasures of his oratory and turned our attention to the savory odor\nof lamb, chicken, and roast pig that came slyly stealing up our\nnostrils to send us nerve dispatches about the gastronomic delights of\nour not far distant future.\n\nAt last the toast was ended and the world-wide soup ushered in a long\ntrain of things good to eat, served in a style better fitted to the\ndelights of the appetite than to the formalities of dinners, for, as\nsoon as the pleasant task of one dish was completed by any one, the\nnext was served him at once regardless of the progress made by the\nothers at the table.\n\nThe last course was dulce. The new-comers to the Philippines will\nnot be long in making the acquaintance of this dish, and at all\nmeetings, both public and private, where eatables are served, it\nperforms an important part. It is anything sweet, and it may vary all\nthe way from an india-rubber-like black mixture of cocoanut milk and\ndirty sugar to a really toothsome and respectable confection. No\nmatter of what materials a dish is composed, just so long as it is\nsweet, it is dulce.\n\nAfter paying our respects to this last course, we arose from the table\nand entered a great rectangular room from the center of whose ceiling\nhung a large glass chandelier, a mass of shimmering crystals. In the\nchairs around the room were the wealth, the youth, and the beauty of\nthe town.\n\nThe first and also the last number of every Filipino dance of any\nformality is the \"rigodon.\" The dancers are arranged in a square, or\nquadrangle according to the number participating, and are then led\nthrough a tangled maze of figures that so utterly bewilders the novice\nthat he sinks into his chair at the end of the dance wondering how it\nall came to pass.\n\nWe Americans breathed a sigh of relief when the \"rigodon\" ended, and\nmustered fresh courage for social conquests in the waltz that was now\nbreathing forth from the trembling strings. My companion in the first\ndance had been the young lady by whose side I had sat at dinner. But\nit now became necessary to search for another, so I prudently waited\nto see how partners were chosen, and made no mistake when a few\nmoments later I faced one of the most luscious looking se\u00f1oritas on\nthe opposite side of the room and offered her my arm. My eyes must\nhave told the story that my lips could not utter in Spanish, for she\nsmiled upon me sweetly, arose, and put her hand upon my shoulder. My\narm encircled her waist and I began to waltz. Unfortunately my\ncompanion did not follow, but began to hop up and down in a manner\nmost distressing. Supposing the attack to be only temporary, I paused\nand, much to my relief, she soon showed signs of recovery; and in the\ncourse of time she came to a standstill looking up into my face in an\ninquiring sort of way, apparently wondering why St. Vitus had not paid\nhis respects to me also. A second attempt to follow the music met with\nresults similar to the first, and during the third attempt, which\nseemed to be trembling on the verge of a failure, St. Vitus let go my\ncompanion and seized me with such vigor that she, who was small even\nfor a Filipino, was gathered up bodily and taken around the room at\nsuch a pace that her toes touched the floor only at far distant\nintervals.\n\nAt this point my devotion to the shrine of Terpsichore ceased from\nforce of circumstances and I seated myself in one of the most\ncomfortable chairs in sight that I might carry out a previously formed\nplan to study the Filipino somewhat critically as he appears in\nsociety.\n\nThe first thing that impressed me as the dancers passed up and down\nthe room was the flash of diamonds. Nearly every woman in the room had\non a brooch that flashed the colors of the rainbow at every turn.\n\nAlmost all of them wore one or more rings that showed up brilliantly\nunder the chandelier. Many of the men too, especially the young men,\nwore gems that appeared to be exquisite. A closer inspection showed\nthat some of the gems had flaws and others were of a poor color, but\nno one would have denied that, taken as a whole, it was a really\nbeautiful display.\n\nThe dress of the ladies was richly colored. Many of their skirts were\nof silk covered with hand embroidered flowers, and their filmy pina\nwaists and broad collar pieces were rich with needle-work. They all\nwore a kind of heelless velvet slipper, very common as a dress shoe in\nthe Philippines, or high-heeled patent leather shoes with neatly\nfitting black stockings.\n\nThe men were dressed in white coats and white pantaloons or black\ncoats and white pantaloons. White shirts and collars, together with\nall sorts and styles of cravats and low-cut patent leather shoes with\nhighly colored socks completed their dress.\n\nIt was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money;\nthat they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a\ntable loaded with good things was a fact to which all of us were\nenthusiastic witnesses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VI. - A SKETCH OF LIFE IN THE PHILIPPINES.\n\n\nHouse-keeping in the Philippines presents some interesting phases. Our\nclub of American officials decided to run a mess, so we employed a\ncook and a house boy, then each of us provided himself with a personal\nservant, making a total of six servants for four men--it takes about\nthis proportion of servants to live in any sort of comfort in the\nPhilippines--and launched ourselves boldly upon the sea of domestic\neconomy. But there were shoals ahead of us, for the question of\nregulating servants is one of no small importance in the Philippines,\nand one of its most disadvantageous features is the long chain of\ndependents that usually attends it.\n\nWe gave the cooks so much a day with which to buy supplies in the\nlocal market, for our own table, making him render a daily list of\nexpenditures, and a fixed amount besides to purchase rice and fish for\nhimself and the other servants. Of course, if they wished to vary\ntheir diet and get chicken and fresh pork, which could be had at far\ndistant intervals, it was wholly a matter of their option, but the\nallowance was made on the basis of so much rice and fish a day for\neach. This allowance was about fifteen cents a day in Spanish coin per\nservant.\n\nThus far all was well. We had agreed to give the cook eight dollars a\nmonth in Spanish money, thinking that good wages would procure good\nservice, but the visions of affluence that floated before him on such\nfloods of wealth were so alluring that they drew him from the kitchen\nto the cooler veranda. In less than a week he had employed an\nassistant at four dollars a month; in less than another week that\nassistant had employed him an assistant at two dollars a month; in\nless than another week that assistant to the assistant had employed\nhim an assistant at the princely salary of fifty cents a month; and\nfrom fear that the chain of dependents would end only by our having\nthe whole Filipino race attached to our culinary force, we broke up\nhouse-keeping and went boarding again, choosing that as the less of\nthe two evils.\n\nOur house furnishings were almost wholly Philippine. The table ware\nand the food on the table came from the ends of the earth. The knives\nand forks were made in Germany, the plates were manufactured in\nEngland, the glass ware and table cloth, in the United States. The\noatmeal and flour came from the United States also. The butter came\nfrom Australia, the rice from China, the salt from Russia, and the\nother eatables from sources about as various as their separate names.\n\nSwitzerland furnished the condensed milk and Illinois the canned\ncream. Nearly all of the canned fruit bore labels from Spain.\n\nThus it can easily be seen that life in the Philippines, if lived\naccording to American ideals, is dependent upon a highly developed and\nhighly complex commerce. However, the difficulties of transportation\nand the restriction of large stocks of merchandise to Manila and some\nhalf a dozen other towns, make so great a difference between country\nlife and city life that a short comparison of the two will not be out\nof place, and life in Manila may well be taken as being fairly typical\nof the latter.\n\nLife in Manila is pleasant, but expensive. It is pleasant from the\nfact that it is not only the capital but also metropolis of the\narchipelago. Thus the combination of wealth and high official position\nhas given to Manila a society of the highest and most refined type.\n\nThe process of beautifying and improving the city which is constantly\ngoing on bids fair to give us at no distant day a city of which we may\nwell be proud.\n\nBut let him who intends living well in Manila on a small income bid\nfarewell at once to so idylic a dream, for it costs much to live well\nthere. In the city of Manila one can get almost anything he wishes,\nbut it must be paid for at the price it commands. Especially in the\ncase of eatables, this price is by no means small, because to the\nfirst cost of articles must in most cases be added the expense of\ndistant shipment from American, European, or Australian ports, and not\ninfrequently the cost of long refrigeration must also be taken into\nconsideration. But, expensive though it is, it is very pleasant to\nlive there and those who have once enjoyed it often wish again to\nquaff the cup of its delights.\n\nIn strong contrast to this pleasant life is the life of the quiet\nlittle hamlet away in the distant islands. Indeed, the Filipino from\nthe distant town, who by some good fortune has been to Manila, or, by\na coup de main, has studied in one of the Manila colleges, is looked\nup to in a true hero-worshiping attitude by all who either know him or\nhear of his fame. Life in such a place is one long state of harmless\ninactivity. Not a wave of trouble from the great outer world ever\ndisturbs its peaceful repose. One lounges forever in an air of\nindolent ease and extreme aversion to anything approaching what might\nbe called a respectable effort.\n\nOne arises in the morning about the time the sun's first rays silver\nthe top leaves of the cocoanut trees and then stirs around until nine\nor ten o'clock, when it is found expedient to avoid a further exposure\nto the sun. From then until about five o'clock in the afternoon it is\nbest to take things as they come, even though one of those things be a\nFilipino dinner. But then you may have your vehiclo attached to a\nyoung bull with a ring in his nose and go for a drive. If it is the\ndry season you will probably enjoy the drive unless you object to the\nfrequent clouds of dust swept along by the evening wind. If it is in\nthe rainy season your pleasure will depend to a considerable extent\nupon how wet you get; but, whether the season be wet or dry, your\npleasure will be regulated largely by the state of harmony existing\nbetween the driver and the bull.\n\nIn these quiet secluded nooks successive generations of Filipinos are\nborn, reared, grow old and die in an even chain of events broken only\nby the occasional erection of a new grass house on the identical spot\nwhere its predecessors have stood for ages. The son lives in the house\nof his father, cultivates the same few square feet of soil planted in\nedible roots, climbs the same cocoanut trees, follows the same winding\npath down to the stream, pounds rice in the same mortar and with the\nsame stick that his ancestors have used from time unremembered, and,\nin case of illness, curls up on a grass mat in a corner of the room\nuntil he dies or by some good fortune recovers. Beyond this narrow\nhorizon he never looks. So narrow and contracted is the life that the\nlanguages of two towns a few miles apart are so different that one\nwould scarcely recognize them as belonging to the same race of people.\n\nSuch are the two extremes of life in our new far Eastern provinces:\nthe one is active, progressive, and cosmopolitan; the other, inactive,\ndecadent, and narrow; but, whether one enjoys the first or endures the\nsecond, there comes to him after leaving a longing to lounge again in\ntropic airs and listen to the lullaby of the winds among the palms.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VII. - THE FILIPINO AT HOME.\n\n\nAs one enters a Filipino sitting-room for the first time, there is one\nfeature in the arrangement of the furniture that impresses itself upon\nhim at once, and it may be stated without fear of serious\ncontradiction that this same peculiar feature in its arrangement will\ncontinue to face him, as he enters different homes, about as certainly\nas he crosses the threshold.\n\nThe arrangement referred to is that of one large mirror, one settee,\nand some ten or a dozen chairs that appear to have had a certain\norderly affection for one another. The mirror is hung upon one of the\nlarge interior parts of the house about four feet above the floor. The\nwooden houses in the Philippines are built by setting large posts\nupright into the ground, extending into the air from twenty to thirty\nfeet. Cross timbers are fastened to these upright posts about eight or\nten feet above the ground and then not sawed off even with the posts,\nbut allowed to extend beyond them each way. The framework of the house\nis built upon these extending cross timbers, a style of building by\nwhich these large upright posts are left standing out on the inside of\nthe room from one to three feet from the walls. It is on that one of\nthese posts most nearly opposite the door that the mirror always finds\nits place. Immediately beneath the mirror is the settee; and the\nchairs are arranged in two parallel lines facing one another and at\nright angles with the ends of the settee. However odd this arrangement\nmay appear to one when he first enters a Filipino drawing-room, there\nare two things to be said in its favor. In the first place, it places\nyou face to face with the person with whom you are conversing so that\nyou can watch him,--a matter of no small moment in the Philippines. In\nthe next place, it enables you to give one of the young ladies a\nsheep's-eye in the mirror while the others present are left where\nMoses was in our much abused conundrum.\n\nThe size of the residence and the quality of its furnishings depends\nupon the wealth of the owner. But there is so vast a difference\nbetween the mode of life of the highest class and the tao, or lowest\nclass, that it is well to speak of them separately, and the great\nmiddle class of Filipinos can easily be imagined to occupy the\nintervening ground.\n\nThe rich Filipino's house is usually of wood built upon a wall of\nstone or brick from ten to fifteen feet high. The floors are kept\nhighly polished in his hallway, dressing-room, and bed-rooms. There\nare, of course, no fire-places in any of the rooms, but on some\noccasions something is needed to dry the rain-soaked atmosphere, for\neven in the dry season it has been seen to rain for five successive\ndays and nights without the cessation of a moment.\n\nA long chain of dependents is attached to the household of the rich\nFilipino. The master has his special body servant to be present at all\ntimes to do his master's bidding, in short, to be the visible\nmechanism of his master's volition. So, too, the lady of the house has\nher servant woman to do the slightest bidding of her ladyship. Then\nthere is the cook who is almost invariably a man, a house boy or two,\nand the coachman. These functionaries, with their assistants and\nassistants to the assistants, together with a servant or two for the\nexclusive service of the children, complete the economic household.\n\nSuch a family has an abundance of rice and wheat bread, also of\nchicken and fish with occasional fresh beef. They have also a good\ndeal of dulce. They regularly serve wine and frequently serve beer\non their tables.\n\nIn strong contrast with this mode of life is that of the tao. His\ndiet consists almost wholly of rice and small uncleaned fish boiled\ntogether. As a rule knife, fork, plate, and spoon find no place in his\nhousehold. The rice and fish are boiled in a pot and then allowed to\ncool in the same vessel or poured out to cool in a large earthen or\nwooden bowl. Then Mr. Tao together with Mrs. Tao and all the young\nTaos squat on their heels around the mixture and satisfy that\nintangible thing called the appetite. They do not use chop sticks as\nthe Chinese do, but the rice and fish are caught in a hollow formed by\nthe first three fingers of the right hand. The thumb is then placed\nbehind the mass. It is raised up and poised before the mouth, with a\nskill coming from the evolution of ages, when a contraction of the\nmuscles of the thumb throws the mass into the mouth with a skill that\nis marvelous to any but a Filipino. To judge from the most reliable\ninformation, the poorest class do not have an abundance of food,\nalthough it would seem that such a condition of things would be\nwell-nigh impossible. However, in a census of one hundred school\nchildren there were found six boys and four girls who declared that\nthey had never had enough to eat, and the native teacher stated that\nthis was probably true.\n\nThe wide gulf between the tao and the rich man is filled by the\ngreat middle class of Filipinos.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VIII. - VISIT TO A LEPER COLONY.\n\n\nNot far from our town was a leper colony and the first Saturday that\ncould be spared was set aside for a trip to the place. It happened\nthat none of the other Americans were at leisure on this particular\nmorning, but, rather then delay the trip or miss it altogether, the\nwriter, armed with a revolver, started out alone.\n\nThe road had been described so accurately by one who was supposed to\nknow it that it was deemed well-nigh impossible to miss the way. The\nmain highway was followed to the point where the by-path supposed to\nlead to the settlement turned off through some bamboo thickets and a\nlow tropical wood. This path led straight away towards the sea-coast\nwhere the houses of the colony were said to stand in a cocoanut grove\nby the beach.\n\nUpon arriving at the settlement, a very inhospitable reception was\nreceived from a mangy cur that growled and showed a very uninviting\nset of sharp, white teeth behind his snarling lips. The growling of\nthe dog had attracted the attention of an old man who, with age-bent\nback, was pounding rice in a mortar about fifty yards away. He turned\nslowly around and, upon seeing an intruder into the primitive quiet of\nthe place, gave a sharp, far-reaching call. The sound had scarcely\nrung through the grove when from about a dozen of the little grass\nhouses dotted here and there fifteen or twenty men armed with bolos\ncame out and gathered around the old man. A sense of my danger flashed\nupon me. Three miles from town and alone in a tropical jungle, I could\nbe almost instantly overcome by this band of bolo-men, and the only\nreport that would ever reach my people would be that I had\n\"disappeared.\" Of course, attack was by no means certain, but the\npotentiality of the situation was thrilling. A drawn revolver and the\ngleaming of its shining barrel had the effect of stopping the men, who\nseemed to be hesitating as to a course of action, until a somewhat\ndignified retreat was made to an open space in the rear from where a\nless dignified and a more hasty retreat began which did not stop short\nof Bacalod.\n\nEnough had been seen, however, even in this short visit, to give\nconvincing proof that the settlement visited was no colony of lepers;\nso, that afternoon two servant boys being taken as guides and\ninterpreters, another attempt was made to reach the goal desired.\n\nThis attempt was successful, and, after about two hours of walking, a\nlittle cluster of grass huts snugly hidden by the sea-coast came into\nview. As we approached, one would have thought it a gala-day. Some few\nchildren, apparently from six to thirteen years of age, almost wholly\nnude, were romping and playing in the open space around which the huts\nstood, and no one would ever have thought that any cloud so horrible\nas leprosy could hover over a place apparently so happy.\n\nBy the side of the path as we passed was a man and his wife setting\nout potato plants. His hands were so puffed and his fingers so short\nthat he could scarcely use them, but he was working along as best he\ncould. His wife's feet were so swollen and twisted that she walked\nonly with the greatest difficulty. We passed them by and entered the\nopen space above referred to.\n\nThe children now saw us, and those of them who could darted away like\nfrightened rabbits, each to his own burrow. An old man who was sitting\nin the warm afternoon sun on the little bamboo platform before his hut\nwas aroused from his lethargic repose by the scampering away of the\nchildren. He arose, trembling upon his tottering limbs, all drawn and\ntwisted, and hobbled away into his hut.\n\nThe children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at\nthe doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of\nthe settlement. In a few moments we were surrounded by a circle of\nhuman beings at once so repulsive and so pitiable that its graphic\nvividness can never be accurately portrayed.\n\nThe old man referred to above, having put on a pair of snow-white\npantaloons, appeared now at the doorway of his hut, followed a few\nmoments later by his wife who had evidently clothed herself in the\nbest raiment she had. At a call from the old man, all the men, women,\nand children in the settlement came out of their huts and stood in a\nline before us. The old man was spokesman and in his native visayan\ntongue made a heart-rending appeal for aid which we were powerless to\ngive. Attention was called to a leper woman, apparently about\ntwenty-five years of age, whose face had been attacked by the disease\nand whose appearance was truly pathetic. Upon her hip was a child\nabout a year and a half old and, strange to say, the child showed as\nyet no signs whatever of the disease.\n\nWhat an indissoluble enigma is life! Here in a little cluster of grass\nhuts in a secluded nook of a secluded island of an all but secluded\narchipelago was gathered together a little community of wretched\nnatives, driven by their loathsomeness from association with others\neven of the same half-savage race. Yet here, men and women loved and\nwere married, by mutual trust if not by law, and children were born of\nthe union to live forever under the unspeakable horror that\novershadowed the unfortunate parents. Love, hatred, sorrow, and\njoy--every passion that enters into the complex structure of the human\nheart even here, in this scene of sadness and despair, was playing\napparently as freely as where misfortune and disease had never crossed\nthe portals of life.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER IX. - A \"HIKE.\"\n\n\nWe were lounging lazily in our hammocks at Jimamaylan one evening in\nApril. Supper was just ended, and the soldiers in the post were\ncollected in groups here and there spinning yarns to pass away the\ntime, when a Filipino clad only in a loin cloth came down the street\nat a steadily swinging run and stopped in front of the sentry. He\nbrought the announcement that a band of ladrones had just burned a\nsugar mill and were advancing to sack a barrio about fifteen miles\naway.\n\nThe invitation of the commanding officer to go on a \"hike\" was eagerly\naccepted, and, in ten minutes after the message was given, the troops\nwere on the march followed by two adventurous pedagogues.\n\nDarkness was just closing in as we left the town, but a resplendent\ntropic moon soon made the night almost as brilliant as the day. The\ntrail we followed led over rough and rocky country. Sometimes for a\ndistance of a mile or more we passed over barren wastes of volcanic\nslag poured out in anger by some peak whose convulsions have long\nsince ceased. Again we would descend into a tropical jungle from the\ndense foliage of which the ladrones could have leaped at any moment,\nhad they known of our coming, and annihilated our little band. We\nforded rapid streams with the water at our breasts, and halted only\nonce in that rapid march of fifteen miles.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the town we met a man who was standing\nguard against a surprise by the ladrones. Nothing could well have been\nmuch more grotesque and nothing could much better illustrate the\nabsolutely primitive condition of the Filipinos in the interior of the\nislands than the appearance of this guard. A pair of knee pants, a\nconical grass hat, and a hemp shirt formed his entire apparel. A long\nflat wooden shield, a bolo, and a long bamboo spear with a sharp,\nflat, iron point, completed his equipment for battle.\n\nHere stood the first and the twentieth centuries side by side. The\nFilipino who had advanced only a stage beyond the condition of\nprimitive man with his knife, spear, and wooden shield, stood side by\nside with the American soldier, a representative of modern life with\nhis magazine rifle, his canteen, his knapsack,--with every article of\nhis clothing made to give him the highest possible efficiency as the\nunit of a military organization.\n\nA few yards farther on we met another guard equipped similarly to the\nfirst. Upon reaching the town, news had just been received that a\ndetachment of troops from another post had intercepted the ladrones\nand fought a skirmish with them. The ladrones had escaped and we set\nout in pursuit of them on a chase wilder than a Quixotic dream. We\nwound our way into the mountains behind the town, inquiring at every\ngrass hut we passed whether the band of ladrones had passed that way,\nbut only once was even a trace of them found. Then it was learned that\nat a certain place they had separated into groups of three or four and\ngone glimmering through the dream of things that were. This place was\nin a secluded nook of the mountains where in years gone by some\nadventurous Spaniard had erected a primitive water mill to grind his\nsugar-cane. We had now marched about twenty miles and the feet of the\npedagogues were a mass of blisters. They had reached the point where\nthat form of military maneuvering called \"hiking\" ceased to possess\nany alluring charms. So a native was persuaded to come out of his lone\nmountain hut and hitch up his carabao and cart. He was then made to\nget on the carabao's back, while the aforesaid pedagogues lay down on\nthe sugar-cane pulp that had been put into the body of the cart, and\nthe driver was instructed to start for the post we had left hours\nbefore, and not to stop until he got there. Being uncertain but that\nsome of the ladrones would learn of our having left the body of troops\nand would try the metal of our steel, we at first agreed that neither\nof us should go to sleep, but it was later decided that probably the\ndriver had no greater desire to cross the Styx than his passengers had\nand that in case of danger he would awaken us, so both took a revolver\nin each hand, stretched out supinely and went to sleep.\n\nSuch a sleep! The rough jolting of the cart over an almost impassable\nroad was never enough to break the spell of slumber. When we awoke the\nblazing tropic sun was past the midday mark of morning, shining full\ninto our unprotected and well-nigh blistered faces.\n\nA pack of dogs were heralding our approach to a little village at the\nfoot of the mountains where ponies were procured to take us back to\nthe post.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he insists, \"have stood the test of ages; and the plant\nevery where retained its name and credit: and one of our good\nherbarists, who had seen a wonderful case of a swoln spleen, so big, and\nhard as to be felt with terror, brought back to a state of nature by it\"\n\n(p. 37). The greatest portion of Hill's concluding section combines\nadvertisement for the powder medicine he was himself manufacturing at a\nhandsome profit together with a protest against competing apothecaries:\n\"An intelligent person was directed to go to the medicinal herb shops in\nthe several markets, and buy some of this Spleen-wort; the name was\nwritten, and shewn to every one; every shop received his money, and\nalmost every one sold a different plant, under the name of this: but\nwhat is very striking, not one of them the right\" (p. 42).\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis did not cease to be printed after Hill's in\n1766, but continued to issue from the presses into the nineteenth\ncentury. A good example of this is the tome by John Reid, physician to\nthe Finsbury Dispensary in London, Essays on Insanity, Hypochondriasis\nand Other Nervous Affections (1816), which summarizes theories of the\nmalady. A bibliographical study of such works would probably reveal\na larger number of titles in the nineteenth century than in the previous\none, but by this time the nature and definition of hypochondria had\nchanged significantly.\n\nIf John Hill's volume is not an important contribution in the history of\nmedicine, it is a lucid and brief exposition of many of the best ideas\nthat had been thought and written on the hyp, with the exception of his\nuninhibited prescribing of herbal medicines as cure-alls. An\nunderstanding of this disease is essential for readers of neoclassical\nEnglish literature, especially when we reflect upon the fact that some\nof the best literature of the period was composed by writers whom it\nafflicted. It is perhaps not without significance that the greatest poet\nof the Augustan age, Alexander Pope, thought it necessary as he lay on\nhis deathbed in May 1744 to exclaim with his last breath, \"I never was\nhippish in my whole life.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. I. - The NATURE of the DISORDER.\n\n\nTo call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and cruel. It\nis a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by thickened\nand distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver, and other\nparts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick scarce knows\none more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\n\nThe blood is a mixture of many fluids, which, in a state of health, are\nso combined, that the whole passes freely through its appointed vessels;\nbut if by the loss of the thinner parts, the rest becomes too gross to\nbe thus carried through, it will stop where the circulation has least\npower; and having thus stopped it will accumulate; heaping by degrees\nobstruction on obstruction.\n\nHealth and chearfulness, and the quiet exercise of mind, depend upon a\nperfect circulation: is it a wonder then, when this becomes impeded the\nbody looses of its health, and the temper of its sprightliness? to be\notherwise would be the miracle; and he inhumanly insults the afflicted,\nwho calls all this a voluntary frowardness. Its slightest state brings\nwith it sickness, anguish and oppression; and innumerable ills follow\nits advancing steps, unless prevented by timely care; till life itself\ngrows burthensome.\n\nThe disease was common in antient Greece; and her physicians understood\nit, better than those perhaps of later times, in any other country; who\nthough happy in many advantages these fathers of the science could not\nhave, yet want the great assistance of frequent watching it in all its\nstages.\n\nThose venerable writers have delivered its nature, and its cure: in the\nfirst every thing now shews they were right; and what they have said as\nto the latter will be found equally true and certain. This, so far as\npresent experience has confirmed it, and no farther, will be here laid\nbefore the afflicted in a few plain words.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. II. - Persons Subject to it.\n\n\nFatigue of mind, and great exertion of its powers often give birth to\nthis disease; and always tend to encrease it. The finer spirits are\nwasted by the labour of the brain: the Philosopher rises from his study\nmore exhausted than the Peasant leaves his drudgery; without the benefit\nthat he has from exercise. Greatness of mind, and steady virtue;\ndetermined resolution, and manly firmness, when put in action, and\nintent upon their object, all also lead to it: perhaps whatever tends to\nthe ennobling of the soul has equal share in bringing on this weakness\nof the body.\n\nFrom this we may learn easily who are the men most subject to it; the\ngrave and studious, those of a sedate temper and enlarged understanding,\nthe learned and wise, the virtuous and the valiant: those whom it were\nthe interest of the world to wish were free from this and every other\nillness; and who perhaps, except for this alloy, would have too large a\nportion of human happiness.\n\nThough these are most, it is not these alone, who are subject to it.\n\nThere are countries where it is endemial, and in other places some have\nthe seeds of it in their constitution; and in some it takes rise from\naccidents. In these last it is the easiest of cure; and in the first\nmost difficult.\n\nBeside the Greeks already named, the Jews of old time were heavily\nafflicted with this disease; and in their descendants to this day it is\noften constitutional: the Spaniards have it almost to a man; and so have\nthe American Indians. Perhaps the character of these several nations may\nbe connected with it. The steady honour, and firm valour of the\nSpaniard, very like that of the ancient Doric nation, who followed the\nflute not the trumpet to the field; and met the enemy, not with shouts\nand fury, but with a determined virtue: it is the temper of the\nHypochondriac to be slow, but unmoveably resolved: the Jew has shewn\nthis mistakenly, but almost miraculously; and the poor Indian, untaught\nas he is, faces all peril with composure, and sings his death-song with\nan unalter'd countenance.\n\nAmong particular persons the most inquiring and contemplative are those\nwho suffer oftenest by this disease; and of all degrees of men I think\nthe clergy. I do not mean the hunting, shooting, drinking clergy, who\nbear the tables of the great; but the retir'd and conscientious; such as\nattend in midnight silence to their duty; and seek in their own cool\nbreasts, or wheresoever else they may be found, new admonitions for an\nage plunged in new vices. To this disease we owe the irreparable loss of\nDr. YOUNG; and the present danger of many other the best and most\nimproved amongst us. May what is here to be proposed assist in their\npreservation!\n\nThe Geometrician or the learned Philosopher of whatever denomination,\nwhose course of study fixes his eye for ever on one object, his mind\nintensely and continually employed upon one thought, should be warned\nalso that he is in danger; or if he find himself already afflicted, he\nshould be told that the same course of life, which brought it on, will,\nwithout due care, encrease it to the most dreaded violence.\n\nThe middle period of life is that in which there is the greatest danger\nof an attack from this disease; and the latter end of autumn, when the\nsummer heats have a little time been over, is the season when in our\nclimate its first assaults are most to be expected. The same time of the\nyear always increases the disorder in those who have been before\nafflicted with it; and it is a truth must be confessed, that from its\nfirst attack the patient grows continually, though slowly, worse; unless\na careful regimen prevent it.\n\nThe constitutions most liable to this obstruction are the lean, and dark\ncomplexioned; the grave and sedentary. Let such watch the first\nsymptoms; and obviate, (as they may with ease) that which it will be\nmuch more difficult to remove.\n\nIt is happy a disease, wherein the patient must do a great deal for\nhimself, falls, for the most part, upon those who have the powers of\nreason strongest. Let them only be aware of this, that the distemper\nnaturally disposes them to inactivity; and reason will have no use\nunless accompanied with resolution to enforce it.\n\nThough the physician can do something toward the cure, much more depends\nupon the patient; and here his constancy of mind will be employed most\nhappily. No one is better qualified to judge on a fair hearing what\ncourse is the most fit; and having made that choice, he must with\npatience wait its good effects. Diseases that come on slowly must have\ntime for curing; an attention to the first appearances of the disorder\nwill be always happiest; because when least established it is easiest\noverthrown: but when that happy period has been neglected, he must wait\nthe effects of such a course as will dilute and melt the obstructing\nmatter gradually; for till that be done it is not only vain, but\nsometimes dangerous, to attempt its expulsion from the body.\n\nThe blood easily separates itself into the grosser and the thinner\nparts: we see this in bleeding; and from the toughness of the red cake\nmay guess how very difficult it will be to dissolve a substance of like\nfirmness in the vessels of the body. That it can thus become thickened\nwithin the body, a Pleurisy shews us too evidently: in that case it is\nbrought on suddenly, and with inflammation; in this other, slowly and\nwithout; and here, even before it forms the obstruction, can bring on\nmany mischiefs. Various causes can produce the same effect, but that in\nall cases operates most durably, which operates most slowly. The watery\npart of the blood is its mild part; in the remaining gross matter of it,\nare acrid salts and burning oils, and these, when destitute of that\nhappy dilution nature gives them in a healthy body, are capable of doing\ngreat mischief to the tender vessels in which they are kept stagnant.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. III. - The SYMPTOMS of the DISORDER.\n\n\nThe first and lightest of the signs that shew this illness are a lowness\nof spirits, and inaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love\nof solitude and a habit of thinking, even on trifling subjects, with too\nmuch steadiness. A very little help may combat these: but if that\nindolence which is indeed a part of the disorder, will neglect them;\nworse must be expected soon to follow.\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness, weight, and oppression in the body,\na want of appetite, or, what is worse, an appetite without digestion;\nfor these are the conditions of different states of the disease, a\nfullness and a difficulty of breathing after meals, a straitness of the\nbreast, pains and flatulencies in the bowels, and an unaptness to\ndischarge their contents.\n\nThe pulse becomes low, weak, and unequal; and there are frequent\npalpitations of the heart, a little dark-coloured urine is voided at\nsome times; and a flood of colourless and insipid at others; relieving\nfor a moment, but increasing the distemper: there is in some cases also\na continual teazing cough, with a choaking stoppage in the throat at\ntimes; then heartburn, sickness, hardness of the belly, and a costive\nhabit, or a tormenting and vain irritation.\n\nThe lips turn pale, the eyes loose their brightness and by degrees the\nwhite grows as it were greenish, the gums want their due firmness, with\ntheir proper colour; and an unpleasing foulness grows upon the teeth:\nthe inside of the mouth is pale and furred, and the throat dry and\nhusky: the colour of the skin is pale (though there are periods when the\nface is florid) and as the obstruction gathers ground, and more affects\nthe liver, the whole body becomes yellow, tawny, greenish, and at length\nof that deep and dusky hue, to which men of swift imagination have given\nthe name of blackness.\n\nThese symptoms do not all appear in any one period of the disease, or in\none case, but at one time or other all of them, as well as those which\nfollow: the flesh becomes cold to the touch, though the patient does not\nhimself perceive it; the limbs grow numbed and torpid, the breathing\ndull and slow, and the voice hollow; and usually the appetite in this\nperiod declines, and comes almost to nothing: night sweats come on,\nblack swellings appear on the veins, the flesh wastes and the breast\nbecomes flat and hollow: the mouth is full of a thin spittle, the head\nis dizzy and confus'd, and sometimes there is an unconquerable numbness\nin the organs of speech.\n\nI have known the temporary silence that follows upon this last symptom\nbecome a jest to the common herd; and the unhappy patient, instead of\ncompassion and assistance, receive the reproof of sullenness, from those\nwho should have known and acted better.\n\nAbout twenty years ago I met on a visit at Catthorpe in Leicestershire a\nyoung gentleman of distinguished learning and abilities, who at certain\ntimes was speechless. The vulgar thought it a pretence: and a jocose\nlady, where he was at tea with company, putting him as she said to a\ntrial, poured out a dish very strong and without sugar. He drank it and\nreturned the cup with a bow of great reserve, and his eye bent on the\nground: she then filled the cup with sugar, and pouring weak tea on it,\nsent it him: he drank that too, looked at her steadily, and blushed for\nher. The lady declared the man was dumb; the rest thought him perverse,\nand obstinate; but a constant and steady perseverance in an easy method\ncured him.\n\nAll these are miseries which the disease, while it retains its natural\nform, can bring upon the patient; and thus he will in time be worn out,\nand led miserably, though slowly, to the grave. Let him not indulge his\ninactivity so far as to give way to this, because it is represented as\nfar off; the disease may suddenly and frightfully change its nature; and\nswifter evils follow.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. IV. - The DANGER.\n\n\nWe have done with the obstruction considered in itself; but this, though\noften unsurmountable by art, at least by the methods now in use, will be\nsometimes broken through at once by nature, or by accidents; and bring\non fatal evils. These are strictly different diseases, and are no\notherway concerned here, than as the consequences of that of which we\nare treating.\n\nThe thick and glutinous blood which has so long stagnated in the spleen,\nwill have in that time altered its nature, and acquired a very great\ndegree of acrimony: while it lies dormant, this does no more mischiefs,\nthan those named already; but when violent exercise, a fit of outrageous\nanger, or any thing else that suddenly shocks and disturbs the frame,\nputs it in motion, it melts at once into a kind of liquid putrefaction.\n\nBeing now thin, it mixes itself readily with the blood again, and brings\non putrid fevers; destroys the substance of the spleen itself, or being\nthrown upon some other of the viscera, corrodes them, and leads on this\nway a swift and miserable death. If it fall upon the liver, its tender\npulpy substance is soon destroyed, jaundices beyond the help of art\nfirst follow, then dropsies and all their train of misery; if on lungs,\nconsumptions; if on the brain, convulsions, epilepsy, palsy, apoplexy;\nif on the surface, leprosy.\n\nThe intention of cure is to melt this coagulation softly, not to break\nit violently; and then to give it a very gentle passage through the\nbowels. There is no safe way for it to take but that; and even that when\nurged too far may bring on fatal dysenteries.\n\nLet none wonder at the sudden devastation which sometimes arises from\nthis long stagnant matter, when liquified too hastily: how long, how\nmany years the impacted matter will continue quiet in a schirrous tumour\nof the breast; but being once put in motion, whether from accident, or\nin the course of nature, what can describe; or what can stop its\nhavock!\n\nInstances of the other are too frequent. A nobleman the other day died\nparalytick: dissection shewed a spleen consumed by an abscess, formed\nfrom the dissolved matter of such an obstruction: and 'tis scarce longer\nsince, a learned gentleman, who had been several years lost to his\nfriends, by the extreams of a Hypochondriacal disorder, seem'd gradually\nwithout assistance to recover: but the lungs suffered while the spleen\nwas freed; and he died very soon of what is called a galloping\nconsumption.\n\nWhen the obstruction is great and of long continuance, if it be thus\nhastily moved, the consequence is, equally, a sudden and a miserable\ndeath, whether, like the matter of a cancer, it remains in its place; or\nlike that of a bad small pox, be thrown upon some other vital part.\n\nLet not the patient be too much alarmed; this is laid down to caution,\nnot to terrify him: it is fit he should know his danger, and attend to\nit; for the prevention is easy; and the cure, even of the most advanced\nstages, when undertaken by gentle means, is not at all impracticable: to\nassist the physician, let him look into himself, and recollect the\nsource of his complaint. This he may judge of from the following\nnotices.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. V. - The Causes of the HYPOCHONDRIASIS.\n\n\nThe obstruction which forms this disease, may take its origin from\ndifferent accidents: a fever ill cured has often caused it; or the\npiles, which had been used to discharge largely, ceasing; a marshy soil,\npoisoned with stagnant water, has given it to some persons; and altho'\nindolence and inactivity are oftenest at the root, yet it has arisen\nfrom too great exercise.\n\nReal grief has often brought it on; and even love, for sometimes that is\nreal. Study and fixed attention of the mind have been accused before;\nand add to these the stooping posture of the body, which most men use,\nthough none should use it, in writing and in reading. This has\ncontributed too much to it; but of all other things night studies are\nthe most destructive. The steady stillness, and dusky habit of all\nnature in those hours, enforce, encourage, and support that settled\ngloom, which rises from fixt thought; and sinks the body to the grave;\neven while it carries up the mind to heaven. He who would have his lamp\n        At midnight hour\n  Be seen in some high lonely tower,\nwill waste the flame of this unheeded life: and while he labours to\nunsphere the spirit of Plato will let loose his own.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VI. - The Cure of the HYPOCHONDRIASIS.\n\n\nLet him who would escape the mischiefs of an obstructed spleen, avoid\nthe things here named: and let him who suffers from the malady,\nendeavour to remember to which of them it has been owing; for half the\nhope depends upon that knowledge.\n\nNature has sometimes made a cure herself, and we should watch her ways;\nfor art never is so right as when it imitates her: sometimes the\npatient's own resolution has set him free. This is always in his power,\nand at all times will do wonders.\n\nThe bleeding of the piles, from nature's single efforts, has at once\ncured a miserable man; where their cessation was the cause of the\ndisorder. A leprosy has appeared upon the skin, and all the symptoms of\nthe former sickness vanished. This among the Jews happened often: both\ndiseases we know were common among them: and I have here seen something\nvery like it: Water-Dock has thrown out scorbutic eruptions, and all the\nformer symptoms of an Hypochondriacal disorder have disappeared:\nreturning indeed when these were unadvisedly struck in; but keeping off\nentirely when they were better treated. A natural purging unsuppressed\nhas sometimes done the same good office: but this is hazardous.\n\nIt is easy to be directed from such instances; only let us take the\nwhole along with us. Bleeding would have answered nature's purpose, if\nshe could not have opened of herself the h\u00e6morrhoidal vessels; but he\nwho should give medicines for that purpose, might destroy his patient by\ntoo great disturbance. If a natural looseness may perform the cure, so\nmay an artificial; when the original source of the disorder points that\nway. But these are helps that take place only in particular cases.\n\nThe general and universal method of cure must be by some mild and gently\nresolving medicine, under the influence of which the obstructing matter\nmay be voided that, or some other way with safety. The best season to\nundertake this is the autumn, but even here there must be caution.\n\nIn the first place, no strong evacuating remedy must be given; for that,\nby carrying off the thinner parts of the juices, will tend to thicken\nthe remainder; and certainly encrease the distemper. No acrid medicine\nmust be directed, for that may act too hastily, dissolve the impacted\nmatter at once, and let it loose, to the destruction of the sufferer; no\nantimonial, no mercurial, no martial preparation must be taken; in\nshort, no chymistry: nature is the shop that heaven has set before us,\nand we must seek our medicine there. The venerable ancients, who knew\nnot this new art, will lead us in the search; and (faithful relators as\nthey are of truth) will tell us whence we may deduce our hope; and what\nwe are to fear.\n\nBut prior to the course of any medicine, and as an essential to any good\nhope from it, the patient must prescribe himself a proper course of\nlife, and a well chosen diet: let us assist him in his choice; and speak\nof this first, as it comes first in order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VI. - Rules of Life for Hypochondriac Persons.\n\n\nAir and exercise, as they are the best preservers of health, and\ngreatest assistants in the cure of all long continued diseases, will\nhave their full effect in this; but there requires some caution in the\nchoice, and management of them. It is common to think the air of high\ngrounds best; but experience near home shews otherwise: the\nHypochondriac patient is always worse at Highgate even than in London.\n\nThe air he breathes should be temperate; not exposed to the utmost\nviolences of heat and cold, and the swift changes from one to the\nother; which are most felt on those high grounds. The side of a hill is\nthe best place for him: and though wet grounds are hurtful; yet let\nthere be the shade of trees, to tempt him often to a walk; and soften by\ntheir exhalation the over dryness of the air.\n\nThe exercise he takes should be frequent; but not violent. Motion\npreserves the firmness of the parts, and elasticity of the vessels; it\nprevents that aggregation of thick humours which he is most to fear. A\nsedentary life always produces weakness, and that mischief always\nfollows: weak eyes are gummy, weak lungs are clogged with phlegm, and\nweak bowels waste themselves in vapid diarrhoeas.\n\nLet him invite himself abroad, and let his friends invite him by every\ninnocent inducement. For me, I should advise above all other things the\nstudy of nature. Let him begin with plants: he will here find a\ncontinual pleasure, and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful\nthings; even of the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to\nwalk; and every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket,\nwill afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually\nin the air, and continually to change the nature and quality of the air,\nby visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the lawn, the\nheath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be abroad; and the\nunceasing variety of the subjects of his observation, will prevent his\nwalking hastily: he will pursue his studies in the air; and that\ncontemplative turn of mind, which in his closet threatened his\ndestruction, will thus become the great means of his recovery.\n\nIf the mind tire upon this, from the repeated use, another of nature's\nkingdoms opens itself at once upon him; the plant he is weary of\nobserving, feeds some insect he may examine; nor is there a stone that\nlies before his foot, but may afford instruction and amusement.\n\nEven what the vulgar call the most abject things will shew a wonderful\nutility; and lead the mind, in pious contemplation higher than the\nstars. The poorest moss that is trampled under foot, has its important\nuses: is it at the bottom of a wood we find it? why there it shelters\nthe fallen seeds; hides them from birds, and covers them from frost;\nand thus becomes the foster father of another forest! creeps it along\nthe surface of a rock? even there its good is infinite! its small roots\nrun into the stone, and the rains make their way after them; the moss\nhaving lived its time dies; it rots and with the mouldered fragments of\nthe stone forms earth; wherein, after a few successions, useful plants\nmay grow, and feed more useful cattle!\n\nIs there a weed more humble in its aspect, more trampled on, or more\ndespised than knot grass! no art can get the better of its growth, no\nlabour can destroy it; 'twere pity if they could, for the thing lives\nwhere nothing would of use to us; and its large and most wonderfully\nabundant seeds, feed in hard winters, half the birds of Heaven.\n\nWhat the weak moss performs upon the rock the loathed toadstool brings\nabout in timber: is an oak dead where man's eye will not find it? this\nfungus roots itself upon the bark, and rots the wood beneath it; hither\nthe beetle creeps for shelter, and for sustenance; him the woodpecker\nfollows as his prey; and while he tears the tree in search of him, he\nscatters it about the ground; which it manures.\n\nNor is it the beetle alone that thus insinuates itself into the\nsubstance of the vegetable tribe: the tender aphide, whom a touch\ndestroys, burrows between the two skins of a leaf, for shelter from his\nwinged enemies; tracing, with more than Dedal\u00e6an art, his various\nmeanders; and veining the green surface with these white lines more\nbeautifully than the best \u00c6gyptian marble.\n\n'Twere endless to proceed; nor is it needful: one object will not fail\nto lead on to another, and every where the goodness of his God will\nshine before him even in what are thought the vilest things; his\ngreatness in the lead of them.\n\nLet him pursue these thoughts, and seek abroad the objects and the\ninstigations to them: but let him in these and all other excursions\navoid equally the dews of early morning, and of evening.\n\nThe more than usual exercise of this prescription will dispose him to\nmore than customary sleep, let him indulge it freely; so far from\nhurting, it will help his cure.\n\nLet him avoid all excesses: drink need scarce be named, for we are\nwriting to men of better and of nobler minds, than can be tempted to\nthat humiliating vice. Those who in this disorder have too great an\nappetite, must not indulge it; much eaten was never well digested: but\nof all excesses the most fatal in this case is that of venery. It is the\nexcess we speak of.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VII. - The proper DIET.\n\n\nIn the first place acids must be avoided carefully; and all things that\nare in a state of fermentation, for they will breed acidity. Provisions\nhardened by salting never should be tasted; much less those cured by\nsmoaking, and by salting. Bacon is indigestible in an Hypochondriac\nstomach; and hams, impregnated as is now the custom, with acid fumes\nfrom the wood fires over which they are hung, have that additional\nmischief.\n\nMilk ought to be a great article in the diet: and even in this there\nshould be choice. The milk of grass-fed cows has its true quality: no\nother. There are a multitude of ways in which this may be made a part\nboth of our foods and drinks, and they should all be used.\n\nThe great and general caution is that the diet be at all times of a kind\nloosening and gently stimulating; light but not acrid. Veal, lamb,\nfowls, lobsters, crabs, craw-fish, fresh water fish and mutton broth,\nwith plenty of boiled vegetables, are always right; and give enough\nvariety.\n\nRaw vegetables are all bad: sour wines, old cheese, and bottled beer are\nthings never to be once tasted. Indeed much wine is wrong, be it of what\nkind soever. It is the first of cordials; and as such I would have it\ntaken in this disease when it is wanted: plainly as a medicine, rather\nthan a part of diet. Malt liquor carefully chosen is certainly the best\ndrink. This must be neither new, nor tending to sourness; perfectly\nclear, and of a moderate strength: it is the native liquor of our\ncountry, and the most healthful.\n\nToo much tea weakens; and even sugar is in this disorder hurtful: but\nhoney may supply its place in most things; and this is not only harmless\nbut medicinal; a very powerful dissolvent of impacted humours, and a\ngreat deobstruent.\n\nWhat wine is drank should be of some of the sweet kinds. Old Hock has\nbeen found on enquiry to yield more than ten times the acid of the sweet\nwines; and in red Port, at least in what we are content to call so,\nthere is an astringent quality, that is most mischievous in these cases:\nit is said there is often alum in it: how pregnant with mischief that\nmust be to persons whose bowels require to be kept open, is most\nevident. Summer fruits perfectly ripe are not only harmless but\nmedicinal; but if eaten unripe they will be very prejudicial. A light\nsupper, which will leave an appetite for a milk breakfast, is always\nright; this will not let the stomach be ravenous for dinner, as it is\napt to be in those who make that their only meal.\n\nOne caution more must be given, and it may seem a strange one: it is\nthat the patient attend regularly to his hours of eating. We have to do\nwith men for the most part whose soul is the great object of their\nregard; but let them not forget they have a body.\n\nThe late Dr. STUKELY has told me, that one day by appointment visiting\nSir ISAAC NEWTON, the servant told him, he was in his study. No one was\npermitted to disturb him there; but as it was near dinner time, the\nvisitor sat down to wait for him. After a time dinner was brought in; a\nboil'd chicken under a cover. An hour pass'd, and Sir ISAAC did not\nappear. The doctor eat the fowl, and covering up the empty dish, bad\nthem dress their master another. Before that was ready, the great man\ncame down; he apologiz'd for his delay, and added, \"give me but leave to\ntake my short dinner, and I shall be at your service; I am fatigued and\nfaint.\" Saying this, he lifted up the cover; and without any emotion,\nturned about to STUKELY with a smile; \"See says he, what we studious\npeople are, I forgot I had din'd.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VIII. - The MEDICINE.\n\n\n'Tis the ill fate of this disease, more than of all others to be\nmisunderstood at first, and thence neglected; till the physician shakes\nhis head at a few first questions. None steals so fatally upon the\nsufferer: its advances are by very slow degrees; but every day it grows\nmore difficult of cure.\n\nThat this obstruction in the spleen is the true malady, the cases\nrelated by the antients, present observation, and the unerring\ntestimonies of dissections leave no room to doubt. Being understood, the\npath is open where to seek a remedy: and our best guides in this, as in\nthe former instance, will be those venerable Greeks; who saw a thousand\nof these cases, where we see one; and with less than half our theory,\ncured twice as many patients.\n\nOne established doctrine holds place in all these writers; that whatever\nby a hasty fermentation dissolves the impacted matter of the\nobstruction, and sends it in that state into the blood, does incredible\nmischief: but that whatever medicine softens it by slow degrees, and, as\nit melts, delivers it to the bowels without disturbance; will cure with\nequal certainty and safety.\n\nFor this good purpose, they knew and tried a multitude of herbs; but in\nthe end they fixed on one: and on their repeated trials of this, they\nbanished all the rest. This stood alone for the cure of the disease; and\nfrom its virtue received the name of SPLEEN-WORT. O wise and happy\nGreeks! authors of knowledge and perpetuators of it! With them the very\nname they gave a plant declared its virtues: with us, a writer calls a\nplant from some friend; that the good gardener who receives the honour,\nmay call another by his name who gave it. We now add the term smooth\nto this herb, to distinguish it from another, called by the same general\nterm, though not much resembling it.\n\nThe virtues of this smooth Spleen-wort have flood the test of ages; and\nthe plant every where retained its name and credit: and one of our good\nherbalists, who had seen a wonderful case of a swoln spleen, so big, and\nhard as to be felt with terror, brought back to a state of nature by it;\nand all the miserable symptoms vanish; thought Spleen-wort not enough\nexpressive of its excellence; but stamp'd on it the name of MILT-WASTE.\n\nIn the Greek Islands now, the use of it is known to every one; and even\nthe lazy monks who take it, are no longer splenetic. In the west of\nEngland, the rocks are stripped of it with diligence; and every old woman\ntells you how charming that leaf is for bookish men: in Russia they use\na plant of this kind in their malt liquor: it came into fashion there\nfor the cure of this disease; which from its constant use is scarce\nknown any longer; and they suppose 'tis added to their liquor for a\nflavour.\n\nThe ancients held it in a kind of veneration; and used what has been\ncalled a superstition in the gathering it. It was to be taken up with a\nsharp knife, without violence, and laid upon the clean linen: no time\nbut the still darkness of the night was proper, and even the moon was\nnot to shine upon it. I know they have been ridiculed for this; for\nnothing is so vain as learned ignorance: but let me be permitted once to\nvindicate them.\n\nThe plant has leaves that can close in their sides; and their under part\nis covered thick with a yellow powder, consisting of the seeds, and seed\nvessels: in these they knew the virtue most resided: this was the golden\ndust they held so valuable; and this they knew they could not be too\ncautious to preserve. They were not ignorant of the sleep of plants; a\nmatter lately spoken of by some, as if a new discovery; and being\nsensible that light, a dry air, an expanded leaf, and a tempestuous\nseason, were the means of losing this fine dust; and knowing also that\ndarkness alone brought on that closing of the leaf which thence has\nbeen called sleep; and which helped to defend and to secure it, they\ntherefore took such time, and used such means as could best preserve the\nplant entire; and even save what might be scattered from it.--And now\nwhere is their superstition?\n\nFrom this plant thus collected they prepared a medicine, which in a\ncourse of forty days scarce ever failed to make a perfect cure.\n\nWe have the plant wild with us; and till the fashion of rough chemical\npreparations took off our attention from these gentler remedies, it was\nin frequent use and great repute. I trust it will be so again: and many\nthank me for restoring it to notice.\n\nSpleen-wort gives out its virtues freely in a tincture; and a small dose\nof this, mixing readily with the blood and juices, gradually dissolves\nthe obstruction; and by a little at a time delivers its contents to be\nthrown off without pain, from the bowels. Let this be done while the\nviscera are yet sound and the cure is perfect. More than the forty days\nof the Greek method is scarce ever required; much oftener two thirds of\nthat time suffice; and every day, from the first dose of it, the patient\nfeels the happy change that is growing in his constitution. His food no\nmore turns putrid on his stomach, but yields its healthful nourishment.\n\nThe swelling after meals therefore vanishes; and with that goes the\nlowness, and anxiety, the difficult breath, and the distracting cholick:\nhe can bear the approach of rainy weather without pain; he finds himself\nmore apt for motion, and ready to take that exercise which is to be\nassistant in his cure; life seems no longer burthensome. His bowels get\ninto the natural condition of health, and perform their office once at\nleast a day; better if a little more: the dull and dead colour of his\nskin goes off, his lips grow red again, and every sign of health\nreturns.\n\nLet him who takes the medicine, say whether any thing here be\nexaggerated. Let him, if he pleases to give himself the trouble, talk\nover with me, or write to me, this gradual decrease of his complaints,\nas he proceeds in his cure. My uncertain state of health does not\npermit me to practise physic in the usual way, but I am very desirous to\ndo what good I can, and shall never refuse my advice, such as it may be,\nto any person rich or poor, in whatever manner he may apply for it. I\nshall refer him to no apothecary, whose bills require he should be\ndrenched with potions; but tell him, in this as in all other cases,\nwhere to find some simple herb; which he may if he please prepare\nhimself; or if he had rather spare that trouble, may have it so prepared\nfrom me.\n\nWith regard to Spleen-wort, no method of using it is more effectual than\nsimply taking it in powder; the only advantage of a tincture, is that a\nproper dose may be given, and yet the stomach not be loaded with so\nlarge a quantity: it is an easier and pleasanter method, and nothing\nmore.\n\nIf any person choose to take it in the other way, I should still wish\nhim once at least to apply to me; that he may be assured what he is\nabout to take is the right plant. Abuses in medicines are at this time\nvery great, and in no instance worse than what relates to herbs. The\nbest of our physicians have complained upon this head with warmth, but\nwithout redress: they know the virtues and the value of many of our\nnative plants, but dread to prescribe them; lest some wrong thing should\nbe administered in their place; perhaps inefficacious, perhaps\nmischievous, nay it may be fatal. The few simple things I direct are\nalways before me; and it will at all times be a pleasure to me, in this\nand any other instance, to see whether what any person is about to take\nbe right. I have great obligations to the public, and this is the best\nreturn that I know how to make.\n\nTo see the need of such a caution, hear a transaction but of yesterday!\n\nAn intelligent person was directed to go to the medicinal herb shops in\nthe several markets, and buy some of this Spleen-wort; the name was\nwritten, and shewn to every one; every shop received his money, and\nalmost every one sold a different plant, under the name of this: but\nwhat is very striking, not one of them the right. Such is the chance of\nhealth in those hands through which the best means of it usually pass;\neven in the most regular course of application.\n\nI would not be understood to limit the little services I may this way be\nable to render the afflicted, to this single instance; much less to\npropose to myself any advantages from it. Whoever pleases will be\nwelcome to me, upon any such occasion; and whatever be the herb on which\nhe places a dependance, he shall be shewn it growing. I once recommended\na garden to be established for this use, at the public expence: one\ngreat person has put it in my power to answer all its purposes.\n\n                        F  I  N  I  S.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris, he was\n\"nominated\" to the Academy. He had but to present an Historical\nPainting in order to take his seat as an Academician.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VENUS AND MARRIAGE\n\n\nBack in his beloved Paris again; thrilled by the atmosphere and gaiety\nof its merry life; in the full vigour of manhood on the eve of his\nthirties; amongst congenial friends; done with the drudgery of winning\nto Academic honour, Boucher saw that the public were not falling over\neach other to purchase religious or historic pictures; he straightway\nturned his back upon these things, and on the edge of his thirtieth\nyear he gave to the world his \"Marriage of the Children of God with\nthe Children of Men,\" in which Venus is the avowed mistress of his\nadoration. It caused a fine stir, and greatly increased his repute.\n\nIn this picture he ends his Italian period and strikes his own\npersonal note. Both this and the \"Venus asking arms for Aeneas from\nVulcan,\" together with the \"Birth of Adonis\" and the \"Death of\nAdonis,\" of about the same period, still show Boucher strongly under\nthe influence of his master, Lemoyne. Indeed, the \"Birth\" and \"Death\nof Adonis,\" their record lost during the scuffle and confusion of the\nRevolution, for long hung side by side as pictures by Lemoyne, until,\nbeing cleaned about 1860, Boucher's initials were discovered upon\nthem, and, contemporary engravings being hunted up, still further\nproved their origin. But in the Venus that now figures in all his\nworks there is that flesh-painting of the nude, and that rosy touch\nupon the flesh of the female figure, that are a far more certain\nsignature of Boucher's handiwork than any written name.\n\nUnfortunately the Salons were closed during Boucher's earlier years\nuntil he was thirty-four, and the record of his work during these\nyears is difficult to follow; but with his service to Venus his\npersonal career begins, and the stream of his Venus-pieces steadily\nflows from his hands.\n\nHe came to her service rid of all prentice essays in craftsmanship, a\nfinished and consummate artist. He found in his subject a goddess to\nwhom he could devote his great and splendid gifts. He painted her\ndainty body with a radiant delight and a rare colour-sense such as\nFrance had never before seen or uttered. He remains to this day the\nfirst painter of the subtle, delicate, and elusive thing that is\nfemininity; he caught her allure, her charm, as he was to catch the\nfragrance and charm of children and flowers; and he set the statement\nof these things upon canvas as they have never been uttered.\n\nThe whole of his life long, Boucher gave himself up with equal and\npassionate devotion to work and to pleasure--working at his easel\noften twelve hours of his day without losing, to the end when the\nbrush fell from his dead fingers, his blitheness of heart or his\ngenerosity of act, and without weakening the pleasure-loving desires\nof his gadding spirit. Out of his splendid toil he made the means to\nindulge his tastes for pleasure; and the gratifying of his tastes in\nturn renewed and created the ideas that made the subjects of his\nartistry. He brought to all he did a joy in the doing that made of his\nvast labour one long pleasure--of his pleasures a riot of industry. He\nplayed as he toiled, scarce knowing which was play and which toil.\n\nThe gossip of his love-affairs makes no romantic story--they were but\ncommonplace ecstasies with unknown frail women. But hard as he worked\nand lived and played, he found time to get himself married in his\nthirtieth year to pretty seventeen-year-old Marie Jeanne Buseau, a\nlittle Parisian--and for love of her, so far as he understood the\nbusiness; for she brought him no dowry.\n\nThe young couple settled down for the next ten years in the Rue\nSaint-Thomas-du-Louvre. Here Boucher lived through his thirties.\n\nMadame was a pretty creature, if we had but Latour's pastel portrait\nalone to prove it. But the pretty features were the crown to as pretty\na body, for she sat often to her lord; and it is clear from his\ncorrespondence with a friend, Bachaumont, that she is the Psyche of\nhis illustrated fable--and Psyche runs much to the Altogether.\n\nMarriage, however, was not likely to imprison Boucher's gadding eyes;\nand it did not. Madame Boucher seems to have had as frail a heart, and\navoided strife by amusing herself, amongst others, with the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who, to gain access to the lady,\ncommissioned Boucher to do the Watteau-like illustrations to\nAcajou--a dull affair. Boucher's pretty wife, herself no mean\nartist, worked in his studio, and painted several smaller canvases\nafter his pictures, gaining some fame as a miniaturist and engraver.\n\nNor did Marriage turn Boucher from his art. Two years were gone by\nsince his nomination to the Academy; he had now to paint the formal\nHistorical Picture and present it in order to take his seat as\nAcademician; and it was in this his thirtieth year that he painted and\nwon his academic rank with the \"Renauld et Armide\" now at the Louvre.\n\nHere he sufficiently subordinated his own style to the academic to\nensure success; and the work was hailed by Academicians and critics,\nincluding Diderot, with enthusiasm. But even here we have his cupids\npeeping round the mythologic event; and Armide herself has pretty\nFrench lips that knew no Greek.\n\nOnce secure of his position, he straightway flung the last remnants of\nthe academic style out of his studio door; and it is a grim comment on\ncriticism that it was just exactly in proportion as he developed his\nown personal genius and uttered the France of his day, that he was\nattacked; whilst the stilted things that he knew were third-rate, and\nwhich he wholly rejected from henceforth, were exactly the things that\nwere praised!\n\nHis election to the Academy, and the enthusiasm over the picture that\nwon him his seat thereat, brought his name before the young king; the\nfollowing year he received his first order from the Court whose\npainter he was destined to become. The decorations in the queen's\napartments were gloomy and had grown black; and he painted in their\nstead the \"Charity,\" \"Abundance,\" \"Fidelity,\" and \"Prudence\" still\nthere to be seen. Indeed, with his gay vision, his pretty habit of\nculling only the flowers from the garden of life, and his quickness to\nset down the pleasing thing in every prospect, Boucher was the\ndestined painter of a Court weary of pomposity and the pose of the\nmock-heroic, and which was wholly giving itself up to pleasure and the\nelegances.\n\nBut neither his new dignity of Academician nor the royal favour, kept\nhim from the bookshops; and he illustrated, with rare beauty and a\ncharm worthy of Watteau, the great edition of the Works of Moli\u00e8re\nin his thirty-first year. It is true that he made as free with\nMoli\u00e8re's world as with the Gods of Olympus; he peoples the plays with\ncharacters of his own day, arrayed in the dress and habit of that day,\nand moving in surroundings that he saw about him.\n\n\nLE MONDE QUI S'AMUSE\n\n\nThe Homely had come upon the town out of Holland, painted with most\nconsummate artistry by Chardin, and was soon in the vogue. Boucher had\na quick eye for the mode. And he straightway set himself to the\npainting of \"La Belle Cuisini\u00e8re.\" Still-life and homely subjects need\nan accuracy of realism and a Dutch sense of these things, a sense of\nsincerity and an appreciation of the dignity of the work-a-day life of\nthe people, in which Boucher was wholly lacking. Above all, it calls\nfor a sense of \"character,\" which, in Boucher, was always weak. It was\na sneer against him that his very broomsticks called for pompons and\nribbons--and there was more than a little truth in the spite. He is\nmore concerned with the accident of the kissing of a kitchen-maid than\nwith the kitchen's habit. He cannot even peep into a scullery without\ndragging in Venus by the skirts, and tricking her out in a\nproperty-wardrobe of a scullery-wench, in which the girl is clearly\nbut acting the part.\n\nHowever, these passing vogues and experiments in different methods\nwere only gay asides--he was working the while upon his own subjects;\nand, to the display by its several members ordered by the Academy, he\nsent four little paintings of fauns and cupids which won him the\nhonour of election as deputy-professor. His brain and hand were very\nbusy, and he turns from one thing to another with amazing facility,\nbringing distinction to all that he does.\n\nBut he painted about this time two pictures of infants, \"L'Amour\nOiseleur\" and \"L'Amour Moissonneur,\" which were the beginning of that\nhost of cupids that he let fly from his studio; they frolic across his\ncanvases and join the retinue of Venus, peeping out from clouds, over\nwaves, round curtains, painted with a perfection that has never been\nsurpassed in the portrayal of infants. He painted their round limbs,\ntheir lusty life, their delightful awkwardnesses, their jolly fat\ngrace, their na\u00efve surprise at life and glory in it, as they had never\nbeen painted before, and have never been painted since.\n\nHe also gave forth in this his thirty-third year a \"Pastoral\" and a\n\"Shepherd and Shepherdess in Conversation,\" with sheep about them and\nin a pleasant landscape, which were his first essays in the style that\nhe created and which made him famous.\n\nHis friend Meissonnier, the inventor of the rococo, stood godfather to\nBoucher's first-born son in the May of 1736.\n\nFrom the very beginning Boucher seems to have been engraved. And these\nengravings, done by the best gravers of his day, greatly extended his\nreputation and popularised him; he fully realised the value of the\nadvertisement as well as his profits from it. Before his thirty-third\nyear was run out he published his well-known \"Cries of Paris.\"\n\nBoucher's description of them, \"studies from the low classes,\" holds\nthe key to that something of failure to realise the dramatic verities\nthat is over all; it gives also the attitude of the France that he\nknew towards the France that he did not, and could not understand. He\ncreated that dainty, pleasant atmosphere that comes floating up to the\nwindows on a fresh morning in Paris from the musical cries of\nthe street vendors; but of the deeper significance of the\nstreet-sellers--of the miserable accent in their life, of their weary\ntoil, of the dignity of their labour--he knew nothing; his brush could\nnot refrain from making elegance and fine manners peep from behind the\nstreet-porter's fustian or the milkmaid's skirt.\n\nBut his thirty-third year was to contain a more far-reaching\nsignificance even than the creation of his cupid-pieces and pastorals.\n\nThe \"Cries of Paris\" were scarce printed when Boucher's illustration\nto \"Don Quixote\" appeared--\"Sancho pursued by the servants of the\nDuke.\" This design was to have far-reaching results that Boucher\nlittle suspected.\n\nThe painter Oudry had been called to the conduct of the great tapestry\nlooms at Beauvais a couple of years before; and in his efforts to\nfurnish the looms with good designs, he now called Boucher to his aid,\nwhose original and fresh style, colour, and arrangement, together with\nhis personal vision, and the enthusiasm and zeal with which he threw\nhimself into the work, at once increased the reputation and the\nproducts of the famous looms. This large designing for the tapestries\nwas, in return, of immense value to the development of the genius of\nthe man, enlarging his breadth of style and giving scope to that great\ndecorative sense that was his superb gift. Thenceforth he was destined\nto play a supreme part in the history of the world-famed factories. He\nnow produced painting after painting for the Beauvais looms.\n\nLife is now one long triumph for Boucher, only disturbed in this year\nby the sad news of the suicide of his old master, Lemoyne. It was in\nthis, Boucher's thirty-fourth year, that the Salon was opened for the\nfirst time since Boucher's infancy, and he contributed several\ncanvases to it.\n\nRigaud, the old Academician, now close upon eighty, straggling through\nthe great galleries, might well blink and gasp at the change that had\ncome over French art since he last exhibited there, thirty-three years\ngone by; but his scoffs and regrets held no terrors for the younger\nAcademicians gathered about. He stood in a new world. A new generation\nwas in possession. The grand manner, the severe etiquette, formal\nmock-heroics, and solemn pomposity of Louis the Fourteenth were\nvanished, and the Agreeable and the Pleasant Make-Believe of Louis the\nFifteenth reigned in their stead. Old Rigaud might blink indeed! Just\nas the imposing and stilted etiquette of the reception-room had given\nplace to the easy manners and airy etiquette of the dainty boudoir, so\nhad light chatter and gay wit and the quick repartee usurped the heavy\nsplendours of a consequential age. France, weary of an eternal pose of\nthe grand manner, was seeking change in joyousness and amusement.\n\nGallantry and gaiety were become the object of the ambition of a\ndandified and elegant day. France became a coquette; dressed herself\nas a porcelain shepherdess; and with beribboned crook and sheep,\nseeking pleasant prospects to stroll through, gave herself to\ndalliance--her powder-puff and patch-box and fan a serious part of her\nunseriousness.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE CH\u00c2TEAUROUX\n\n\nAt thirty-five Boucher has arrived. He is in the vogue; in favour at\nCourt--as well as in the fashion. In his three years from taking his\nseat at the Academy to the opening of the first Salon he has created a\nnew and original style--his cupid pieces, his pastorals, his\nVenus-pieces, his tapestry. Boucher's kingdom lay in the realm of the\ndecorative painter--and he has found it. Torn from the surroundings\nfor which he designed them, as part and parcel of the general scheme,\nhis pictures are as out of place as an Italian altarpiece in an\nEnglish dining-room, yet they suffer less. Several may still be seen,\nas he set them up in frames of his own planning, as overdoors in the\npalace of the Soubise, now given up to the national archives.\n\nThe ghost of the Prince of Soubise, who commissioned them, may haunt\nhis palace, but his kin know the place no longer. The overdoors\nwrought by Boucher's skill look down now on the nation's collection of\nhistoric documents. The \"Three Graces enchaining Love,\" the fine\npastoral of \"The Cage,\" and the pastoral of the \"Shepherd placing a\nRose in his Shepherdess's Hair,\" were to see a mightier change than\nthe usurpation of Louis the Fourteenth's pompous age by the elegant\nyears of Louis the Fifteenth. But this was not as yet. Here at least\nwe see Boucher's art rid of all outside influences, and at the full\ntide of creation; here we have the inimitable lightness of touch, the\nfigures and landscape bathed in the airy volume of atmosphere.\n\nHe seems at this time to have played with pastel, due probably to his\nfriendship with Latour, who sent a portrait of Boucher's wife to this\nSalon. Boucher showed in the use of chalks the artistry and skill that\nwere always at his command.\n\nHe also was putting to its full use his innate sense of landscape,\nraising to high achievement that astonishing balance of landscape and\nfigures in his design--a balance that has never been surpassed; his\nfigures never override his landscape; his landscape never overpowers\nhis figures. His earnest counsels to his pupils and his constant\ndeploring of the lack of the landscape art in France prove the great\nstress he laid upon it.\n\nThe designing of a frontispiece for the catalogue of a personal\nfriend, one Gersaint, a merchant of oriental wares, started Boucher in\nhis thirty-third year upon that series of Chinese pictures and\ntapestries known as the \"Chinoiseries,\" in which he frittered away\nonly too many precious hours, for they were received with great favour\nby the public. The paintings of Chinese subjects designed for the\nlooms of Beauvais are still to be seen at Besan\u00e7on.\n\nBut busy as were his brain and hand in the exercise of his wide and\nversatile gifts, pouring out \"Chinoiseries,\" illustrations for books,\ntapestries on a large scale, landscapes, models for the gilt bronze\ndecorations of porcelain vases, scheming handsome frames for his\npictures, designing furniture and fans--Boucher was true, above all,\n\"to his goddess,\" and painted the famed \"Birth of Venus,\" which,\nthanks to the Swedish Ambassador's fondness for Madame Boucher, now\nhangs at Stockholm; our amorous Count de Tessin, to be just, seems to\nhave had a rare flair for the artistic--besides artist's wives. It was\non the 15th of April in 1742, the last year of his thirties, that the\nRoyal favour was marked by the grant of a pension of 400 livres\n(double florins) to Boucher with promise of early benefits to follow.\n\nTwo years afterwards it was raised to 600 livres.\n\nThis was the year that he painted the beautiful canvas of \"Diana\nleaving the Bath with one of her Companions,\" now at the Louvre. It\nwas also the year that saw his landscape, the \"Hamlet of Iss\u00e9\" at the\nSalon. This \"Hameau d'Iss\u00e9\" was to be enlarged for the Opera, proving\nhim to be decorator there, where he was arranging waterfalls,\ncascades, and the rest of the pretty business, without staying his\nhand from his art.\n\nAt forty Boucher has come into his kingdom. The ten years of these\nforties were to be a vast triumph for him. He was to produce\nmasterpiece after masterpiece. His art had caught the taste of the\nday. He was at the height of his powers. He had done great things--he\nwas to do greater. During these ten years of his forties he poured\nforth vivid and glowing works of sustained power and originality.\n\nWe have a picture of him as he was in the flesh at this time--the\npastel portrait by Lundberg, now at the Louvre--a gay, somewhat\ndissipated, handsomely dressed dandy of the time, smiling out of his\ncareless day, the debonnair man of fashion, the laughing eyes showing\nsigns of the night carousals, which were the rest from the prodigious\ntoil of this vital and forthright spirit.\n\nIt was in this our artist's fortieth year that the gifted old Cardinal\nFleury, who had guided the fortunes of France with rare skill, died,\nbroken by his ninety years and the blunders of the disastrous war that\nhe had so strenuously opposed; and Louis, essaying the strut of\nkingship, became king by act. His indolent character, unequal to the\nmighty business, his indeterminate will fretted by the set of\nquarrelling and intriguing rogues that he gathered about him as his\nministers, he fell into the habit that became his thenceforth, the\nonly thing to which he paid the tribute of constancy--he ruled France\nfrom behind pretty petticoats. He had early shown the adulterous blood\nof his great-grandfather; two, if not three, of five sisters of the\nnoble and historic house of De Nesle had yielded to his gadding fancy;\nthe youngest now ousted her sister De Mailly from the king's favour,\nwas publicly acknowledged as the king's mistress, and became Duchess\nof Ch\u00e2teauroux. Boucher painted her handsome being as a shepherdess in\none of his pastorals. She was no ordinary toy of a king. A woman of\ntalent, with hot ambitions for the king's majesty, fired with the\npride of race of the old French noblesse, it was during her short\nyears of ascendancy over the king that he roused from his body's\ntorpor and made an effort to reach the dignity and eminence befitting\nto the lord of a great and gallant people. He stepped forth awhile\nfrom his drunken bouts and manifold mean adulteries, and set himself\nat the head of the army in Flanders, and strutted it as conqueror.\n\nPoor Ch\u00e2teauroux only got the hate of the people for reward, Louis the\nhonours; for the people resented the public dishonour of her state.\n\nPower she found to be a dead-sea apple in her pretty mouth. The glory\nof it all, the splendours, were not the easily won delights for which\nshe had looked. She had to fight a duel, that never ended, with the\nking's witty, crafty, and scurrilous Prime Minister, the notorious\nMaurepas--and Maurepas willed that no woman should ever come between\nhim and the king--Maurepas who knew no mercy, no decency, no chivalry,\nno scruple. At Ch\u00e2teauroux's urging, Louis placed himself at the\nhead of the army; and France went near mad with joy that she had\nagain found a king. Crafty Maurepas urged on the business; the\nCh\u00e2teauroux suddenly realised his cunning glee--it separated her from\nthe king.\n\nOut of the whirl of things Boucher's fortune was ripening, little as\nhe might suspect it.\n\nHe was painting masterpieces that make his name live. To his fortieth\nyear belong the famed \"Birth of Venus,\" the \"Venus leaving the Bath,\"\nthe \"Muse Clio,\" the \"Muse Melpomene,\" and the three well-known\npastorals now at the Louvre--\"The Sleeping Shepherdess,\" the \"Nest,\"\n\n\nand the \"Shepherd and Shepherdesses.\" Of the many famous Venus-pieces\nthat his hand painted during these years it is not easy to write the\nlist. But having signed the \"Marriage of Love and Psyche\" at\nforty-one, he turned his experimental hand to the homely, realistic\nDutch style that was having a wide vogue, and painted the\n\"Dejeuner\"--a family of the prosperous class of the day at\nbreakfast--showing with rare charm the surroundings and home life of\nthe well-to-do of his time.\n\nAll goes well with Boucher. He changes into better quarters in the Rue\nde Grenelle-Saint-Honor\u00e9, where he lived for the next five years,\nuntil 1749; but his eyes are fixed upon a studio and apartments at\nthe old palace of the Louvre, though the hard intriguing of his\npowerful friends at Court on his behalf failed for some time. He had,\nindeed, to make another move before he arrived at his longed-for goal.\n\nPensions Boucher, like others, had found to be somewhat empty affairs;\nbut rooms at the Louvre were a solid possession eagerly sought after\nby the artists.\n\nIn this year of 1744 Boucher created a new fashion at the annual Salon\nby sending studies and sketches instead of finished pictures; and it\nset a value upon such things not before realised by artists, for\nsuccess was instant and loud.\n\nTowards the end of the next, Boucher's forty-second year, the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who was to take his leave of Paris,\ncommissioned four pictures to represent the day of a woman of fashion,\nand to be entitled \"Morning,\" \"Midday,\" \"Evening,\" and \"Night.\"\n\nBoucher painted one of these for him, now known as the \"Marchande de\nModes.\" The others were painted later, and all had a wide vogue as\nengravings. The correspondence has interest since it reveals Boucher's\nbusiness habits; he was paid for a picture on its delivery, and for\neach of these he was to receive 600 livres (double florins or\ndollars)--about a hundred and twenty pounds.\n\nIn an official document of the Director of Buildings to the king (or\nMinister of Fine Art, as we should say), written in this year of 1745,\nBoucher being forty-two, is a \"list of the best painters,\" in which\nBoucher is singled out for distinction as \"an historic painter, living\nin the Rue de Grenelle-Saint-Honor\u00e9, opposite the Rue des Deux-Ecus,\npupil of Lemoyne, excelling also in landscape, grotesques, and\nornaments in the manner of Watteau; and equally skilled in painting\nflowers, fruit, architecture, and subjects of gallantry and of\nfashion.\"\n\nNot so bad for dry officialdom; the critics could learn a lesson. For\nhe was nothing less. What indeed does he not do? and wondrous well!\nthis painter of the age.\n\nAnd the mighty rush of events is about to sweep him into further\nprominence; the very things which he probably passed by with a gay\nshrug are to enrich him, to help him to his highest fulfilment.\n\nPoor Ch\u00e2teauroux saw that she must lose the king's gadding favour in\nthe conflict with Maurepas unless she joined her lord, now with the\narmy. She realised full well that she had created the new Louis of\nAmbition--that her going must bring the people's hate to her. But she\ndared not lose the king. And she went. Maurepas had overdone his\njibings. The indiscretion at once rang through the land; became the\njest of the army--and Maurepas was not far from the bottom of the\nbusiness. The discreet indiscretion of covered ways between the king's\nlodgings and hers only added to the mockeries, and increased the\npeople's hate against, of course, the Ch\u00e2teauroux. Then upon a day in\nAugust the small-pox seized Louis at Metz; poor Ch\u00e2teauroux fought for\npossession of the king in the sick room, until his fear of\ndeath--Louis' sole piety--sent her packing--shrinking back in the\nhired carriage at each halting-place for change of horses, lest she\nshould be seen and torn from her place and destroyed by the populace.\n\nBut Louis recovered; Paris rang with bells at joy on his recovery, and\nhe entered the city amidst mad enthusiasm, hailed as The Well-Beloved.\n\nHe sent for the Ch\u00e2teauroux to find her dying, Maurepas having to\ndeliver the message of recall. She died suddenly and in great agony,\nswearing that Maurepas had poisoned her--died in the arms of her poor\ndiscarded sister, the De Mailly.\n\nBut this year of 1745 Boucher hears a mightier scandal that is to mean\nvast things to all France--and not least of all to Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE POMPADOUR\n\n\nA young bride had become the gossip of the rich merchant society of\nParis--that class that was ousting the old noblesse from power. She\nwas a beautiful, a remarkable woman; her wit was repeated in the\ndrawing-rooms, she had all the accomplishments; her charming\nname--Madame Lenormant d'Etioles.\n\nDraw aside the curtains of the past and we discover our little Jeanne\nPoisson--grown into this exquisite creature. It has come about in\nstrange fashion enough. The father--a scandalous fellow--having\nfingered the commissariat moneys in ugly ways to his own use, had been\nbanished for the ugly business. Nor is Jeanne's mother any better than\nshe should be; and the wags wink knowingly at the handsome and rich\nman of fashion, Monsieur Lenormant de Tournehem, who has been the\nfavoured gallant during the absence of the light-fingered Poisson.\n\nAnd, of a truth, Lenormant de Tournehem takes astonishing interest in\nthe little Jeanne--watching over her up-growing and giving her the\nbest of education at the convent, where she wins all hearts, and is\nknown as \"the little queen.\" The truth spoken with wondrous prophecy,\nif unthinkingly, as we shall see. Complacent Poisson came home, and\ntook the rich and fashionable, bland and smiling Lenormant de\nTournehem to his arms. Has he not wealth and estates? therefore as\nexcellent a friend for Poisson as for Madame Poisson. The girl Jeanne\nleaves the convent to be taught the accomplishments by the supreme\nmasters of France, the wits foregather at Madame Poisson's, and the\nbrilliant Jeanne is soon mistress of the arts--coquetry not least of\nall; has also the most exquisite taste in dress. Under all is a heart\ncold as steel; calculating as the higher mathematics. She has but one\nhindrance to ambition--her mean birth. Lenormant de Tournehem rids her\neven of this slur by making his nephew, Lenormant d'Etioles, marry\nher, giving the young couple half his fortune for dowry, and the\npromise of the rest when he dies--also he grants him a splendid\ntown-house, as splendid a country seat. And consequential\nself-respecting little Lenormant d'Etioles is lord of Etioles, amongst\nother seignories. So Jane Fish appears as Madame Lenormant d'Etioles,\nseductive, beautiful, accomplished, to whose house repair the new\nphilosophy, the wits, and artists. She has a certain sense of virtue;\nindeed openly vows that no one but the king shall ever come between\nher and her lord. But, deep in her heart, she has harboured a fierce\nambition--that the king shall help her to keep her bond. She puts\nforth all her gifts, all her powers, to win to the strange goal;\nconfides it to her worldly mother and \"uncle,\" Lenormant de Tournehem;\nfinds keen allies therein to the reaching of that strange goal. The\ndeath of the Ch\u00e2teauroux clears the way. At a masked ball the king is\nintrigued as to the personality of a beautiful woman who plagues him\nwith her art; he orders the unmasking. Madame Lenormant d'Etioles\nstands revealed, drops her handkerchief as by accident; the whisper\nruns through the Court that \"the handkerchief has been thrown!\" The\nking stoops and picks it up. A few evenings later she is smuggled into\nthe \"private apartments.\" She goes again a month later; in the morning\nis seized with sudden terror--she daren't go back to her angry lord\nlest he do her grievous harm; he will have missed her. The king is\ntouched; allows her to hide from henceforth in the secret apartments;\npromises the beautiful creature a lodging, her husband's banishment,\nand early acknowledgment as titular mistress--before the whole Court\nat Easter, says the pious Great One. But he has to join the army to\nplay the Conqueror at Fontenoy; and it is later in the year\n(September) before Madame d'Etioles is presented to the Court in a\nvast company and proceeds to the queen's apartments to kiss hands on\nappointment. Thus was Jeanne Poisson raised to the great aristocracy\nof France in her twenty-third year as Marquise de Pompadour.\n\nBoucher had been one of the brilliant group of artists of the\nd'Etioles' circle. That the Pompadour's influence had much effect upon\nhis position at Court for a year or two is unlikely; for she had to\nfight for possession of the king day and night, as the Ch\u00e2teauroux\nhad done, against the queen's party and the unscrupulous enmity of\nMaurepas. To set down Boucher's favour at Court to her is ridiculous.\n\nHe was painting for the queen's apartments at thirty-one when the\nPompadour was a school-girl of twelve. But in the year following her\nrise to power, Boucher painted four pictures for the large room of the\nDauphin, which were \"placed elsewhere\"; and, the year after that, he\nwas at work upon two pictures for the bedroom of the king at the\ncastle of Marly. It is likely enough that the Pompadour directed this\norder. She had almost immediately secured the office of the\nDirector-General of Buildings, which covered the direction of the\nroyal art treasures, for \"uncle\" Lenormant de Tournehem, who was also\na friend of the artist. And from this year it is significant that\nBoucher paints no more for the opposing camp of the Queen and Dauphin.\n\nHe was now giving all his strength to the \"Rape of Europa\" that he\npainted for the competition ordered by the Academy at the command of\nLenormant de Tournehem in the king's name, in which ten chosen\nAcademicians were to paint subjects in their own style for six prizes\nand a gold medal, to be awarded in secret vote by the competing\nartists themselves. Boucher won, by his amiable nature, the good-will\nof them all by proposing that they should so arrange as to share the\nprizes equally, and thus prevent any sense of soreness inevitable in\nthe losers.\n\nBut greatly as he won the good-fellowship of his fellow-artists by it,\nthis picture caused a murmur to rise amongst the critics who,\naforetime loud in his praise, now began to complain of his \"abuse of\nrose tints\" in the painting of the female nude. The fact was that\nDiderot and the men of the New Philosophy were turning their eyes to\nthe whole foundations upon which France was built, art as well as\nsociety, and were beginning to demand of art \"grandeur and morality in\nits subjects.\" They were soon to be clamouring for \"the statement of a\ngreat maxim, a lesson for the spectator.\" Diderot, with bull-like\ncourage, picked out the greatest, and turned upon Boucher, blaming him\nfor triviality.\n\nThe nations, weary of war, concluded the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in\nthe October of 1748. No sooner was peace concluded than Louis\nrelapsed into his old habit of dandified indolence and profligate\nease; and, putting from him his duties as the lord of a great people,\nhe gave himself up to shameless intrigues. He allowed the Pompadour to\nusurp his magnificence and to rule over the land. He yielded himself\nutterly, if sometimes sulkily, to her domination; and for sixteen\nyears she was the most powerful person at Court, the greatest force in\nthe state--making and unmaking ministers, disposing of office,\nhonours, titles, pensions. All political affairs were discussed and\narranged under her guidance; ministers, ambassadors, generals\ntransacted their business in her stately boudoirs; the whole patronage\nof the sovereign was dispensed by her pretty hands; the prizes of the\nChurch, of the army, of the magistracy could be obtained solely\nthrough her favour and good-will. Her energy must have been\nprodigious. Possessed of extraordinary talents and exquisite tastes,\nshe gave full rein to them, and it was in the indulgence of her better\nqualities that Destiny brought Boucher into the friendship of this\nwonderful woman. She became not only his patron but his pupil,\nengraving several of his designs.\n\nBut this, her sovereignty over the king, easy and light in its outward\nseeming, was a haggard nightmare to the calculating woman who had so\nlonged for it. She knew no single hour's rest from the night she won\nto the king's bed. She had to fight her enemies, secret and open, for\npossession of the king's will, day and night; and she fought--with\nrare courage. She won by consummate skill and unending pluck. She made\nherself an essential part of the king's freedom from care. The Court\nparty fought her for power with constant vigilance. Maurepas brought\nall his unscrupulous art, all his ironic mimicry, all his vile jibes\nand unchivalrous hatred to bear against her. He had made himself a\nnecessity to the king; and he never slept away a chance of injuring\nher. He knew no mercy, no nobility, no pity. He made her the detested\nobject of the people. With his own hands he penned the witty verses\nand epigrams that were sung and flung about the streets of Paris.\n\nBut she had an enemy more subtle than any at the Court--hour by hour\nshe had to dispute the king with the king's boredom. And it was in the\neffort to do so that she created her celebrated theatre in the\nprivate apartments, calling Boucher and others to her aid in the doing\nof it. Here the noblest of France vied with each other to obtain the\nsmallest part to play, an instrument in its orchestra, an invitation\nto its performances.\n\nBoucher left the Opera to become its decorator in 1748, and did not\nreturn until her death. For her, he also decorated her beautiful rooms\nat Bellevue. She bought at high prices many of his greatest\nmasterpieces.\n\nThe Pompadour's power so greatly increased that she openly took\ncommand of the king's will; dared and succeeded in getting his\nfavourite Maurepas banished; and herself took to the use of the kingly\n\"we.\" Her rascally father was created Lord of Marigny; her brother,\nwhom the king liked well and called \"little brother,\" was created\nMarquis de Vandi\u00e8res; her only child, Alexandrine, signed her name as\na princess of the blood royal, and would have been married to the\nblood royal had she not caught the small-pox and died. She amassed a\nprivate fortune, castles, and estates such as no mistress had dreamed\nof; and into them she poured art treasures that cost the nation\nthirty-six millions of money. She created the porcelain factory of\nS\u00e8vres, kept keen watch over the Gobelins looms, and founded the great\nMilitary School of St. Cyr amidst work that would have kept several\nstatesmen busy, and of deadly intrigues at Court that would have\nbroken the spirit of many a brilliant man.\n\nIt was in her hectic desire to keep the king from being bored that she\nstooped, and made Boucher stoop, to the employment of his high\nartistry in the painting of a series of indecent pictures wherewith to\ntickle the jaded desires of Boredom, and thereby gave rise to the\nwidespread impression that Boucher's art was ever infected by base\ndesign. But Boucher was, at his very worst, but a healthy animal; and\neven in these secret works for the king he did not reach so low as did\nmany an artist of more pious memory who painted with no excuse but his\nown pleasure.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the Pompadour has been blamed too much for this\nevil act, and too much forgotten for her splendid patronage of the man\nwho, under it and during these great years of his forties, produced a\nseries of masterpieces that place him in the foremost rank of the\npainters of his century. It is impossible to reckon the number of the\npastorals and Venus-pieces that his master-hand painted and loved to\npaint, during these the supreme years of his genius. It is significant\nthat they were painted during the years that saw the Pompadour in\nsupreme power.\n\nBoucher was so firmly established in 1750, his forty-seventh year,\nthat he moved into a new house in the Rue Richelieu, near the Palais\nRoyal. Disappointed in not receiving a studio and apartments at the\nLouvre, he was allowed to use a studio in the king's library. He was\nnow making money so easily that he was able to collect pictures and\nprecious stones and the gaily coloured curiosities that appealed to\nhis tastes.\n\nThe critics were becoming more and more censorious; and one of them\nhits true with the comment that in his pastorals his shepherdesses\nlook as if they had stepped over from the Opera and would soon be off\nagain thereto.\n\nIn his forty-eighth year Boucher's art was at its most luminous\nstage--his atmosphere clear and subtle and exquisitely rendered; his\nyellows golden; his whites satin-like and silvery; his flesh-tones\nupon the nude bodies of his goddesses unsurpassed by previous art. The\nbeauty of it all was not to last much longer.\n\nLenormant de Tournehem died suddenly in the November of 1751; the\nPompadour's brother, Abel Poisson de Vandi\u00e8res, was appointed\nDirector-General in his stead at the age of twenty-five--and soon\nafterwards, on the death of his father, created Marquis de Marigny--a\nshy, handsome youth, a gentleman and an honourable fellow, whom the\nking liked well, and against whom his sister's sole complaint was that\nhe lacked the brazen effrontery of the courtiers of the day. No man\ndid more for the advancement of the art of his time. A pension of a\nthousand livres falling vacant, the young fellow secured it for\nBoucher; and almost immediately afterwards, a studio becoming vacant\nat the Louvre owing to the death of Coypel, first painter to the king,\nBoucher came to his coveted home, eagerly moving in with his family as\nsoon as its wretched state could be put into repair.\n\nThe decoration of the new wing to the palace at Fontainebleau brought\nthe commission for the painting of the ceiling and the principal\npicture in the Council Chamber to Boucher, who had already decorated\nthe Dining-Room. This was the period of his painting the \"Rising\" and\nthe \"Setting of the Sun\" for the Pompadour, now in the Watteau\ncollection, two canvases that were always favourites with the painter,\nbitterly as they were assailed by the critic Grimm.\n\nHe was turning out so much work that it was impossible to give as much\ncare to his pictures as he ought. For he refused sternly, his life\nlong, to raise his prices; by consequence he had to create a larger\namount of work in order to meet his expenditure. It was about this\ntime that Reynolds, passing through Paris, went to visit him and found\nhim painting on a huge canvas without models or sketches. \"On\nexpressing my surprise,\" writes Reynolds, \"he replied that he had\nconsidered the model as necessary during his youth until he had\ncompleted his study of art, but that he had not used one for a long\ntime past.\"\n\nHe soon had not the time, not only to paint from nature but even to\ngive his pictures the work necessary to complete them. The feverish\nhaste which took possession of him in his frantic endeavour to meet\nthe vast demand for his pictures, and the eager efforts of his\nengravers to satisfy the public call for engravings after his works,\ngave him less and less leisure to joy in their doing. And his eyesight\nbegan to fail. His flesh-tints deepened to a reddish hue; and he\nstands baffled before his work, suspecting his sight, since what every\none cries out upon as being bright vermilion, he only sees as a dull\nearthy colour. Boucher has topped the height of his achievement; he\nhas to \"descend the other side of the hill.\" Boucher begins to grow\nold.\n\nIn Boucher's fifty-first year an ugly intrigue of the queen's party at\nCourt to sap the Pompadour's influence over the king by drawing away\nthe king's affections towards Madame de Choiseul-Romanet, a reckless\nyoung beauty of the Court, brought about a strange alliance. The Count\nde Stainville, one of the Pompadour's bitterest enemies, was shown the\nking's letter of invitation to his young kinswoman; and he, deeply\nwounded in his pride that his kinswoman should have been offered to\nthe king, went to the Pompadour and exposed the plot. A close\nalliance followed; and De Stainville thenceforth became her chief\nguide in affairs of state. It was at her instance that the king called\nhim to be his Prime Minister, raising him to the Duchy of Choiseul--a\nname he made illustrious as one of the greatest Ministers of France.\n\nIn his fifty-second year Boucher was appointed to the directorship of\nthe Gobelins looms, to the huge delight of the weavers and all\nconcerned with the tapestry factory. This was the year of his painting\nthe famous portrait of the Pompadour, to whom he several times paid\nthis \"tribute of immorality.\" For the Gobelins looms he produced many\nhandsome designs; and he was painting with astounding industry. But\nhis hand's skill began to falter. His art shows weariness in his\nsixtieth year, and sickness fell upon him, and held him in servitude\nnow with rare moments of respite. The critics, notoriously Diderot,\nwere now attacking him with shameless virulence. Boucher passed it all\nby; but he felt the change that was taking place in the public taste.\n\nThe ideas of the New Philosophy were infecting public opinion; the Man\nof Feeling had arisen in the land; and France, humiliated in war, and\nresenting the follies and the greed of her shameless privileged class,\nwas openly resenting it and all its works. Choiseul had planted his\nstrength deep in the people's party, and was come near to being its\ngod. His masterly mind had checked Frederick of Prussia to the North;\nand the nations, exhausted by the struggle, signed the Peace of Paris\nin 1763. Choiseul, with France at peace abroad, turned to the blotting\nout of the turbulent order of the Jesuits at home. Their attempt to\nend the Pompadour's relations with the king made this powerful woman\neager to complete his design; the chance was soon to come, and the\nOrder was abolished from France and its vast property seized by the\nstate.\n\nThe Pompadour lived but a short while to enjoy her triumph. Worn out\nby her superhuman activities, assailed by debt, she fell ill of a\nracking cough, dying on the 15th of April, 1764, in her forty-second\nyear, keeping her ascendancy over the king and the supreme power in\nFrance to her last hour. Death found her transacting affairs of state.\n\nLouis, weary of his servitude, had only a heartless epigram to cast\nat the body of the dead woman as she passed to her last resting-place.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE END\n\n\nThe death of the Pompadour robbed Boucher of a friend; but her\nbrother, Marigny, remained faithfully attached to the old artist, and\nseized every chance to honour him. On the death of Carle van Loo,\nBoucher, at sixty-two, was made first painter to the king, with all\nhis pensions and privileges that were consistent with this the supreme\nappointment in the art world.\n\nThere had been serious intention of making Boucher the head of the\nEcole des El\u00e8ves Proteg\u00e9s; he had the art of making himself liked and\nof inspiring the love of the arts. He was very popular with the\nstudents and artists, owing to his kindliness, his eagerness to render\nservice, his readiness to encourage the youngsters or to console them.\n\nWhen the riot took place, provoked by the Academicians by their award\nof the Prix de Rome in 1767, the students insulted the Academicians,\nbut hailed Boucher with enthusiastic applause. The reason was not far\nto seek. When a student came to the old master for advice he did not\n\"play the pontiff,\" and, scorning the false dignity of big phrases, he\ntook the brush in his hand and showed the way out of all difficulties\nby simplehearted example, despising rules, and putting himself out in\norder to make things clear to a young artist.\n\nHowever, the Academicians feared he would be an unorthodox master for\nyouth, and appointed another in his place.\n\nA long and serious illness thwarted his keen energies. Diderot was\ngiving himself up to outrageous violence against him. If the old\npainter exhibited at the Salon, Diderot fiercely assailed his art; if\nhe did not exhibit, Diderot as bitterly assailed him for his\nnegligences. Above all, he attacked Boucher in that he did not paint\nwhat Diderot would have painted--but could not. \"When he paints\ninfants,\" cries Diderot, \"you will not find one employed in a real act\nof life--studying his lesson, reading, writing, stripping hemp.\"\n\nPoor unfortunate infants! for whom Philosophy could find no happier\njoy in life than stripping hemp! Boucher was but an artist. He\npainted his generation as far as he could see it, and, with all his\nfaults and weaknesses, he never debauched his art with foreign and\nalien things that had no part in the nation's life; he painted fair\nFrance into his landscapes, not a make-believe land he did not know\nwith preposterous Greek ruins; and best of all, to his eternal honour,\nhe painted infants glad in their gladness to be alive, with no desire\nto send their happy little bodies to school, with no sickly ambition\nto make them into budding philosophers, with no thought of making them\npose and lie as Men of Feeling. He had no joy in setting their little\nbodies to toil--in making them \"teach a lesson to the spectator,\" in\nmaking them stoop their little shoulders to the \"picking of hemp.\"\n\nHe continued to paint as he had always painted--except that he painted\nless well. The wreath of roses was wilting on a grey head. The blood\njigged less warmly in the frail body. The features showed pallid--the\neyes haggard. The sight failed. The hand alone kept something of its\ncunning.\n\nHe went to Holland with his friend Randon du Boisset, but health\nshrank farther from him. Diderot had near spent his last jibe.\n\nIn 1768, Boucher's sixty-fifth year, the neglected queen went to her\ngrave. The king's grief and contrition and vows to amend his life came\ntoo late, and lasted little longer than the drying of the floods of\ntears over the body of his dead consort. A year later he was become\nthe creature of a pretty woman of the gutters, whom he caused to be\nmarried to the Count du Barry--the infamously famous Madame du Barry.\n\nBut neither the remonstrances of Choiseul with the king against this\nfurther degradation of the throne of France, nor his unconcealed scorn\nof the upstart countess, nor the dangerous enemy he made for himself\nthereby, signified now to Boucher, first painter to the king.\n\nBoucher was failing. His son was a prig and a disappointment. His two\nfavourite pupils, Baudoin and Deshayes, who had married his two girls,\ndied.\n\nTo the Salon of 1769 he sent his \"Caravan of Bohemians.\" It was his\nlast display. He had been going about for some time like a gaunt ghost\nof his former self, afflicted with all the ills inevitable to a life\nfeverishly consumed in work and the pursuit of pleasure.\n\nThey went to his studio at five of the clock one May morning, and\nfound him seated at his easel, before a canvas of Venus, dead, with\nthe paint-filled brush fallen out of his fingers.\n\nSo passed he away on the 30th of May 1770, in his sixty-seventh year.\n\nWhen Boucher died, the generation of which he was the limner was near\ncome to its violent end. The rosy carnivals and gay gallantries of his\nage gave way to the blood-stained romance and fierce tempest of the\nRevolution. The garrets of the old curiosity-shops received the\ndiscarded canvases of the master. His shepherds and shepherdesses were\nput to rout by the Romans of his pupil, citizen David. The old order\nwas brought into contempt and overthrown. And with it, Boucher's art,\nlike much that was gracious and charming and good in the evil thing,\nwent down also, and was overwhelmed for a while.\n\nFor a while only. For just as, out of the blood and terror of the\nRevolution, a real France arose, phnix-wise, from the ruin, and in\nbeing born, whilst putting off the vilenesses of the thing from which\nshe sprang, took on also to herself the gracious and winsome qualities\nthat place her amongst the most fascinating peoples of the ages; so\nBoucher has come into his kingdom again--the most gracious of painters\nthat the years have yielded."

                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n        a. One bed, or folding cot,\n        b. One oil stove,\n        c. One lamp,\n        d. Enough supplies of all kinds sufficient for six months,\n        e. Pots, pans, kettles, etc.\nIt is needless to say that positions in Manila and Iloilo were now at\na premium.\n\nWas it possible that teachers were to be sent to places where even the\nnecessaries of life could not be obtained! Was it possible that many\nwould be sent to places so remote that for six months no fresh\nsupplies could be gotten! A mass meeting was held at once, and a\ncommittee was appointed to send a cablegram to the Associated Press\npetitioning aid from the American people at large. Realizing what\nconsternation would be created throughout the United States by such a\nmessage, two of the teachers leaped into a carriage at the close of\nthe meeting and a few moments later were closeted with the chief\nexecutive of the department. As a result the committee was persuaded\nnot to send the cablegram to the Associated Press until by courtesy it\nhad been sent to the President. Of course, this diplomatic move tided\naffairs over and the teachers who had flatly refused to budge from\nManila now agreed to go on to their stations, being assured that\nwhatever action was best would be taken.\n\nThe day had come when we must separate. We were to enter an untried\nand an unknown field. It was fitting that we have a final joyous\nmeeting, so the best orchestra in the archipelago was engaged and we\n\"chased the hours with flying feet\" until dawn so that whatever might\ncome to us in that unknown future upon which we were entering each\nwould hold in pleasant memory our last evening together.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER III. - A DRAMA IN ACTUAL LIFE.\n\n\nAlmost every one heeded the warning to go to his station forearmed\nwith at least necessaries of life, but, as it had never fallen to the\nlot of the writer to cook, he refused to learn at that late day, so he\ntook no pot, no pan, no kettle, putting his future into the hands of\nan uncertain fate and relying upon the unknown hospitality of the\nFilipino.\n\nBacalod, the capital of the province of Occidental Negros, was our\ndestination. The second morning after leaving Manila, we awoke with\nthe \"Kilpatrick\" lying at anchor in a shallow bay. We were several\nmiles from the shore and nothing in sight indicated that we had\nreached a place of any importance. Late the night before we had been\nawakened by the loud, sharp ringing of the ship's bells, accompanied\nby the reversal of the engines and a general disturbance awaking the\ncrew. So our first impressions on coming on deck were that we had run\naground. But the captain assured us that everything was ship-shape and\nthat this was the nearest point of approach to Capiz, a town of\nconsiderable importance on the island of Panay, where a body of troops\nwas to embark for home. Not even the grass hut of a native was in\nsight. Search as we would, not a sign was seen of a stream flowing\ninto the sea, indicating the probable presence of a town. There was\nnot a sign of life of any kind save one lone column of thin, blue\nsmoke that arose from the side of a mountain miles away. One would\nhave thought that we were explorers of three hundred years ago lying\noff the shore of some unknown land.\n\nAfter breakfast the steam launch, together with all the boats, was\nlowered, and several of us who had determined to miss no opportunity\nto gather information about the islands took our places in the launch\nby the side of the ship's mate, and steamed away across the water with\na long line of boats strung out in the rear. We headed away toward a\ngroup of cocoanut trees, and about an hour later stepped ashore on a\npile of decayed coral rocks that extended some twenty or thirty feet\nout into the water, thus forming the only landing place of a town of\nseveral thousands of people and of considerable commercial importance.\n\nA few moments after we had landed, an army wagon drawn by a\nmagnificent pair of mules came up out of a tropical jungle along a\nnarrow road. We clambered into the wagon and were soon lost in the\ndepths of foliage from which we had just seen the vehicle emerge.\n\nLong waving bamboos with their plumy leafage hung over the road from\neach side, meeting and overlapping in the center until they formed an\narchway so dense that the tropical sun now high in the heavens\npenetrated it only at intervals. At times the wagon sank up to the\nhubs in the soft earth, and the muscles of the mules stood out like\nwhip-cords under the skin as they drew us forward.\n\nAt a sharp turn in the road we came upon the first division of troops\nthat was to embark for home. The look of joy upon their sun-browned\nfaces was inexpressible. Their work was done, and with elastic step\nand smiling faces they saluted us as they passed by. The reign of\nforce was at an end; it was going out with them; the reign of peace\nhad begun; it was coming in with us.\n\nIn the afternoon when we returned from the town the last of the troops\nhad arrived and, as we drove up, the bugle was sounding the call to\nsupper. We noticed native women mingling with the troops and, indeed,\na native woman was in constant attention waiting upon one of the\nsoldiers with whom we ate. Her clothes were clean, her hair was nicely\ncombed, and her general appearance was neat. She seemed to anticipate\nthe slightest wish of the soldier with whom she was. She brought him\nwater to drink, cleaned his plate after the meal and saw that his\nknife, fork, and spoon were put into his haversack.\n\nWe had now finished supper and the launch had returned for the last\nload of troops. The lieutenant in command of the company gave the\norder to \"fall in\"; the men shouldered their rifles and fell into\nline. \"Forward, march!\" called the lieutenant, and the column swept\nforward towards the boats. The women had until now restrained\nthemselves, but, as their husbands marched away never to return, their\nfeelings could no longer be restrained. One young woman of about\neighteen, who was leaning against a rock by the roadside sobbing, when\nher husband passed, leaped up in frenzy of passionate love and caught\nthe rifle from his shoulder. Her first impulse seemed to be to throw\nthe gun away, but suddenly realizing the futility of such an act she\nburst into tears, shouldered the rifle herself and marched on by his\nside. Another woman of more mature age threw her arms around the legs\nof a tall stalwart man, and drew him bodily from the line.\n\nBut the troops marched on and entered the boats. One woman who had\nbeen unnoticed before came down into the shallow water and caught hold\nof our last boat as if to prevent its leaving, while others stood\nmingling their sobs with the sounds of the wavelets as they broke on\nthe sands. As we passed away, an expectant mother, standing in bold\noutline against the twilight sky, threw up her hands in an agony of\ndespair and then sank upon the stones. The curtain had fallen upon a\ndrama in actual life deeper in pathos than any other we had ever seen\nor ever expected to see. Depth of passion, depth of love! Who can\nfathom the human heart?\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. - WHAT THE TEACHERS DID.\n\n\nThere is a remarkable sameness about the towns in the Philippines.\n\nThey all have a large open square about the middle of the town, around\nthree sides of which are Chinese stores, unless one side lies open to\nthe sea, and on the fourth is the great stone ecclesia. The streets\nrun at right angles to one another and divide up the town into\ncreditable squares.\n\nEverybody in the Philippines lives up-stairs, for the ground is so\nsoaked with water during the rainy season that it is a menace to\nhealth to live upon the ground floor. So even the poorest nippa hut\nis built upon stakes four or five feet above the ground.\n\nBacalod is a typical Philippine town. As we landed, a broad open\nsquare was spread out before us. Two sides of the square were lined\nwith two-story houses in which were Chinese stores below and Filipino\nhomes above. On the third side stood the great stone church in whose\nmassive tower the clock was striking the hour of four, while the\nfourth lay open to the sea that had borne us thither.\n\nWe landed, but it was in a method new to us and one not usually\nemployed by the traveling public.\n\nWhen our sail boat ran aground on the sandy bottom a hundred yards or\nmore from the shore, a crowd of Filipino men who were on the beach\nslowly rolled up their pantaloons and waded out to the rescue,--for\nthe money that was in it. The boat's crew elevated their trousers'\nlegs also and slided down into the water. Each of us then straddled\nthe neck of a Filipino standing in the water and was held by ankles to\nbe steadied while our biped mounts proceeded to the shore.\n\nWe were now on the ground and face to face with the situation. To give\nthe reader an idea of the actual conditions met by the first teachers\nwho went to the Islands, the following is copied from the instructions\ngiven us in Manila:\n    1. There shall be two sessions daily of all schools, and the\n    last hour of the morning session shall be devoted solely to\n    instructing the Filipino teachers.\n\n    2. In cases where teachers are sent to a town in which there\n    is no school-house, they are expected to secure the aid of the\n    people and have one built.\n\n    3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is\n    stopped.\n\n    4. All supplies must be kept under lock and key. In towns\n    where there is no case or box to lock the supplies in, and it\n    is also impossible to get the town council to furnish a case,\n    a requisition may be sent to Manila, and, if an appropriation\n    can be secured, one will be made and sent out.\n\nThus it can be easily seen that we were indeed pioneers. In many\nplaces no school-house was to be found, and in some cases it was even\ndifficult to get the town council to provide a case in which to keep\nthe supplies.\n\nThe work of the teachers was, in short; to \"make the English language\nthe basis of instruction in the public schools.\" On our arrival at\nBacalod two schools were found in progress, for some soldiers had been\ndetailed for the work here previous to our coming. One of these was\nfor boys and the other, for girls. Thus the work here had been in a\nmeasure simplified, but complications that had arisen at Talisay, one\nof the largest and richest towns on the island, demanded a change of\nteachers and the writer was assigned to the place as superintendent.\n\nHere an attempt had been made to start a school but it had failed\nignominiously and a system of education was to be put into operation\nfrom the very start.\n\nThe Filipinos are not strong advocates of co-education, so separate\nschools were to be started for the boys and the girls. The one for the\nboys was gotten well in hand before the one for the girls was\nattempted at all.\n\nA few days after reaching the town and securing a home the\npresidente of the town had it publicly announced that the following\nMonday morning at eight o'clock a public school for boys would be\nopened in a building that had been rented for the purpose by the\nmunicipal council. About the middle of the afternoon of the same day a\nman beat a little drum throughout all the streets of the town to call\nthe people out and the town clerk announced both in Spanish and in the\nnative language that this public school would begin at the time and\nplace mentioned above; that instruction would be free to all who came;\nthat the government would furnish all supplies; and that instruction\nwould be given in the English language. A native principal and\nassistants were employed and everything was ready to begin.\n\nThe official report of the result is as follows:\n    Boys' public school of Talisay, Negros, P. I., began November\n    4, 1901. Forty-three boys present at eight o'clock. Forty-one\n    of them knew \"good morning\" and \"good afternoon\" but do not\n    know the distinction between them. Two of them speak simple\n    Spanish. At eight forty-five, eight more, who had been\n    attending an early morning private school, came in together.\n\n    The books they brought were so varied and so different from\n    one another that it seemed impossible to bring any reasonable\n    degree of order out of such a chaos, and so, after struggling\n    vainly for about a week with the problem, the superintendent\n    by one fell stroke removed everything in use and put in a\n    uniform system, and from that day on the English language has\n    been the basis of instruction in the public schools of\n    Talisay. The work was of necessity very slow at first, but by\n    the end of a year two schools were going nicely and a number\n    of the brightest boys and girls had made really excellent\n    progress.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER V. - A \"BAILE.\"\n\n\nNot long after the arrival of our party at Bacalod we received an\ninvitation to a \"baile\" given in our honor by the inhabitants of\nSilay, a town some ten or twelve miles up the northern coast and one\nnoted for its social life. The invitation was accepted with pleasure,\nand about the middle of the afternoon on the day appointed we were\nclad in the immaculate white of the tropics and steaming away up the\ncoast on board a launch sent for our conveyance. Twilight was still\nlingering on the path of day when we anchored just off shore at the\ntown. A row-boat containing the officials of the city came out to meet\nus and, in due season, we were ushered into a spacious drawing-room\nfilled almost to overflowing with the \u00e9lite of the town. The \u00e9lite of\ntowns in the Philippines speak Spanish, and, as only one or two of our\nparty could at that time boast of more than a formal acquaintance with\nthe Castilian tongue, the exchange of ideas that evening between us\nand the Filipinos was of necessity not very rapid.\n\nThe necessity of easy communication between us was rendered somewhat\nless indispensable by the announcement of supper as soon as we were\nrested from our trip. When we had taken our places at the table a\nyoung Filipino about twenty-five years of age arose and gave a lengthy\ntoast to the recent union of the Philippines with the United States.\n\nBut as we Americans were unable to scale the dizzy heights of his\nclimaxes or sink to the depths of his pathos, we forewent the\npleasures of his oratory and turned our attention to the savory odor\nof lamb, chicken, and roast pig that came slyly stealing up our\nnostrils to send us nerve dispatches about the gastronomic delights of\nour not far distant future.\n\nAt last the toast was ended and the world-wide soup ushered in a long\ntrain of things good to eat, served in a style better fitted to the\ndelights of the appetite than to the formalities of dinners, for, as\nsoon as the pleasant task of one dish was completed by any one, the\nnext was served him at once regardless of the progress made by the\nothers at the table.\n\nThe last course was dulce. The new-comers to the Philippines will\nnot be long in making the acquaintance of this dish, and at all\nmeetings, both public and private, where eatables are served, it\nperforms an important part. It is anything sweet, and it may vary all\nthe way from an india-rubber-like black mixture of cocoanut milk and\ndirty sugar to a really toothsome and respectable confection. No\nmatter of what materials a dish is composed, just so long as it is\nsweet, it is dulce.\n\nAfter paying our respects to this last course, we arose from the table\nand entered a great rectangular room from the center of whose ceiling\nhung a large glass chandelier, a mass of shimmering crystals. In the\nchairs around the room were the wealth, the youth, and the beauty of\nthe town.\n\nThe first and also the last number of every Filipino dance of any\nformality is the \"rigodon.\" The dancers are arranged in a square, or\nquadrangle according to the number participating, and are then led\nthrough a tangled maze of figures that so utterly bewilders the novice\nthat he sinks into his chair at the end of the dance wondering how it\nall came to pass.\n\nWe Americans breathed a sigh of relief when the \"rigodon\" ended, and\nmustered fresh courage for social conquests in the waltz that was now\nbreathing forth from the trembling strings. My companion in the first\ndance had been the young lady by whose side I had sat at dinner. But\nit now became necessary to search for another, so I prudently waited\nto see how partners were chosen, and made no mistake when a few\nmoments later I faced one of the most luscious looking se\u00f1oritas on\nthe opposite side of the room and offered her my arm. My eyes must\nhave told the story that my lips could not utter in Spanish, for she\nsmiled upon me sweetly, arose, and put her hand upon my shoulder. My\narm encircled her waist and I began to waltz. Unfortunately my\ncompanion did not follow, but began to hop up and down in a manner\nmost distressing. Supposing the attack to be only temporary, I paused\nand, much to my relief, she soon showed signs of recovery; and in the\ncourse of time she came to a standstill looking up into my face in an\ninquiring sort of way, apparently wondering why St. Vitus had not paid\nhis respects to me also. A second attempt to follow the music met with\nresults similar to the first, and during the third attempt, which\nseemed to be trembling on the verge of a failure, St. Vitus let go my\ncompanion and seized me with such vigor that she, who was small even\nfor a Filipino, was gathered up bodily and taken around the room at\nsuch a pace that her toes touched the floor only at far distant\nintervals.\n\nAt this point my devotion to the shrine of Terpsichore ceased from\nforce of circumstances and I seated myself in one of the most\ncomfortable chairs in sight that I might carry out a previously formed\nplan to study the Filipino somewhat critically as he appears in\nsociety.\n\nThe first thing that impressed me as the dancers passed up and down\nthe room was the flash of diamonds. Nearly every woman in the room had\non a brooch that flashed the colors of the rainbow at every turn.\n\nAlmost all of them wore one or more rings that showed up brilliantly\nunder the chandelier. Many of the men too, especially the young men,\nwore gems that appeared to be exquisite. A closer inspection showed\nthat some of the gems had flaws and others were of a poor color, but\nno one would have denied that, taken as a whole, it was a really\nbeautiful display.\n\nThe dress of the ladies was richly colored. Many of their skirts were\nof silk covered with hand embroidered flowers, and their filmy pina\nwaists and broad collar pieces were rich with needle-work. They all\nwore a kind of heelless velvet slipper, very common as a dress shoe in\nthe Philippines, or high-heeled patent leather shoes with neatly\nfitting black stockings.\n\nThe men were dressed in white coats and white pantaloons or black\ncoats and white pantaloons. White shirts and collars, together with\nall sorts and styles of cravats and low-cut patent leather shoes with\nhighly colored socks completed their dress.\n\nIt was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money;\nthat they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a\ntable loaded with good things was a fact to which all of us were\nenthusiastic witnesses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VI. - A SKETCH OF LIFE IN THE PHILIPPINES.\n\n\nHouse-keeping in the Philippines presents some interesting phases. Our\nclub of American officials decided to run a mess, so we employed a\ncook and a house boy, then each of us provided himself with a personal\nservant, making a total of six servants for four men--it takes about\nthis proportion of servants to live in any sort of comfort in the\nPhilippines--and launched ourselves boldly upon the sea of domestic\neconomy. But there were shoals ahead of us, for the question of\nregulating servants is one of no small importance in the Philippines,\nand one of its most disadvantageous features is the long chain of\ndependents that usually attends it.\n\nWe gave the cooks so much a day with which to buy supplies in the\nlocal market, for our own table, making him render a daily list of\nexpenditures, and a fixed amount besides to purchase rice and fish for\nhimself and the other servants. Of course, if they wished to vary\ntheir diet and get chicken and fresh pork, which could be had at far\ndistant intervals, it was wholly a matter of their option, but the\nallowance was made on the basis of so much rice and fish a day for\neach. This allowance was about fifteen cents a day in Spanish coin per\nservant.\n\nThus far all was well. We had agreed to give the cook eight dollars a\nmonth in Spanish money, thinking that good wages would procure good\nservice, but the visions of affluence that floated before him on such\nfloods of wealth were so alluring that they drew him from the kitchen\nto the cooler veranda. In less than a week he had employed an\nassistant at four dollars a month; in less than another week that\nassistant had employed him an assistant at two dollars a month; in\nless than another week that assistant to the assistant had employed\nhim an assistant at the princely salary of fifty cents a month; and\nfrom fear that the chain of dependents would end only by our having\nthe whole Filipino race attached to our culinary force, we broke up\nhouse-keeping and went boarding again, choosing that as the less of\nthe two evils.\n\nOur house furnishings were almost wholly Philippine. The table ware\nand the food on the table came from the ends of the earth. The knives\nand forks were made in Germany, the plates were manufactured in\nEngland, the glass ware and table cloth, in the United States. The\noatmeal and flour came from the United States also. The butter came\nfrom Australia, the rice from China, the salt from Russia, and the\nother eatables from sources about as various as their separate names.\n\nSwitzerland furnished the condensed milk and Illinois the canned\ncream. Nearly all of the canned fruit bore labels from Spain.\n\nThus it can easily be seen that life in the Philippines, if lived\naccording to American ideals, is dependent upon a highly developed and\nhighly complex commerce. However, the difficulties of transportation\nand the restriction of large stocks of merchandise to Manila and some\nhalf a dozen other towns, make so great a difference between country\nlife and city life that a short comparison of the two will not be out\nof place, and life in Manila may well be taken as being fairly typical\nof the latter.\n\nLife in Manila is pleasant, but expensive. It is pleasant from the\nfact that it is not only the capital but also metropolis of the\narchipelago. Thus the combination of wealth and high official position\nhas given to Manila a society of the highest and most refined type.\n\nThe process of beautifying and improving the city which is constantly\ngoing on bids fair to give us at no distant day a city of which we may\nwell be proud.\n\nBut let him who intends living well in Manila on a small income bid\nfarewell at once to so idylic a dream, for it costs much to live well\nthere. In the city of Manila one can get almost anything he wishes,\nbut it must be paid for at the price it commands. Especially in the\ncase of eatables, this price is by no means small, because to the\nfirst cost of articles must in most cases be added the expense of\ndistant shipment from American, European, or Australian ports, and not\ninfrequently the cost of long refrigeration must also be taken into\nconsideration. But, expensive though it is, it is very pleasant to\nlive there and those who have once enjoyed it often wish again to\nquaff the cup of its delights.\n\nIn strong contrast to this pleasant life is the life of the quiet\nlittle hamlet away in the distant islands. Indeed, the Filipino from\nthe distant town, who by some good fortune has been to Manila, or, by\na coup de main, has studied in one of the Manila colleges, is looked\nup to in a true hero-worshiping attitude by all who either know him or\nhear of his fame. Life in such a place is one long state of harmless\ninactivity. Not a wave of trouble from the great outer world ever\ndisturbs its peaceful repose. One lounges forever in an air of\nindolent ease and extreme aversion to anything approaching what might\nbe called a respectable effort.\n\nOne arises in the morning about the time the sun's first rays silver\nthe top leaves of the cocoanut trees and then stirs around until nine\nor ten o'clock, when it is found expedient to avoid a further exposure\nto the sun. From then until about five o'clock in the afternoon it is\nbest to take things as they come, even though one of those things be a\nFilipino dinner. But then you may have your vehiclo attached to a\nyoung bull with a ring in his nose and go for a drive. If it is the\ndry season you will probably enjoy the drive unless you object to the\nfrequent clouds of dust swept along by the evening wind. If it is in\nthe rainy season your pleasure will depend to a considerable extent\nupon how wet you get; but, whether the season be wet or dry, your\npleasure will be regulated largely by the state of harmony existing\nbetween the driver and the bull.\n\nIn these quiet secluded nooks successive generations of Filipinos are\nborn, reared, grow old and die in an even chain of events broken only\nby the occasional erection of a new grass house on the identical spot\nwhere its predecessors have stood for ages. The son lives in the house\nof his father, cultivates the same few square feet of soil planted in\nedible roots, climbs the same cocoanut trees, follows the same winding\npath down to the stream, pounds rice in the same mortar and with the\nsame stick that his ancestors have used from time unremembered, and,\nin case of illness, curls up on a grass mat in a corner of the room\nuntil he dies or by some good fortune recovers. Beyond this narrow\nhorizon he never looks. So narrow and contracted is the life that the\nlanguages of two towns a few miles apart are so different that one\nwould scarcely recognize them as belonging to the same race of people.\n\nSuch are the two extremes of life in our new far Eastern provinces:\nthe one is active, progressive, and cosmopolitan; the other, inactive,\ndecadent, and narrow; but, whether one enjoys the first or endures the\nsecond, there comes to him after leaving a longing to lounge again in\ntropic airs and listen to the lullaby of the winds among the palms.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VII. - THE FILIPINO AT HOME.\n\n\nAs one enters a Filipino sitting-room for the first time, there is one\nfeature in the arrangement of the furniture that impresses itself upon\nhim at once, and it may be stated without fear of serious\ncontradiction that this same peculiar feature in its arrangement will\ncontinue to face him, as he enters different homes, about as certainly\nas he crosses the threshold.\n\nThe arrangement referred to is that of one large mirror, one settee,\nand some ten or a dozen chairs that appear to have had a certain\norderly affection for one another. The mirror is hung upon one of the\nlarge interior parts of the house about four feet above the floor. The\nwooden houses in the Philippines are built by setting large posts\nupright into the ground, extending into the air from twenty to thirty\nfeet. Cross timbers are fastened to these upright posts about eight or\nten feet above the ground and then not sawed off even with the posts,\nbut allowed to extend beyond them each way. The framework of the house\nis built upon these extending cross timbers, a style of building by\nwhich these large upright posts are left standing out on the inside of\nthe room from one to three feet from the walls. It is on that one of\nthese posts most nearly opposite the door that the mirror always finds\nits place. Immediately beneath the mirror is the settee; and the\nchairs are arranged in two parallel lines facing one another and at\nright angles with the ends of the settee. However odd this arrangement\nmay appear to one when he first enters a Filipino drawing-room, there\nare two things to be said in its favor. In the first place, it places\nyou face to face with the person with whom you are conversing so that\nyou can watch him,--a matter of no small moment in the Philippines. In\nthe next place, it enables you to give one of the young ladies a\nsheep's-eye in the mirror while the others present are left where\nMoses was in our much abused conundrum.\n\nThe size of the residence and the quality of its furnishings depends\nupon the wealth of the owner. But there is so vast a difference\nbetween the mode of life of the highest class and the tao, or lowest\nclass, that it is well to speak of them separately, and the great\nmiddle class of Filipinos can easily be imagined to occupy the\nintervening ground.\n\nThe rich Filipino's house is usually of wood built upon a wall of\nstone or brick from ten to fifteen feet high. The floors are kept\nhighly polished in his hallway, dressing-room, and bed-rooms. There\nare, of course, no fire-places in any of the rooms, but on some\noccasions something is needed to dry the rain-soaked atmosphere, for\neven in the dry season it has been seen to rain for five successive\ndays and nights without the cessation of a moment.\n\nA long chain of dependents is attached to the household of the rich\nFilipino. The master has his special body servant to be present at all\ntimes to do his master's bidding, in short, to be the visible\nmechanism of his master's volition. So, too, the lady of the house has\nher servant woman to do the slightest bidding of her ladyship. Then\nthere is the cook who is almost invariably a man, a house boy or two,\nand the coachman. These functionaries, with their assistants and\nassistants to the assistants, together with a servant or two for the\nexclusive service of the children, complete the economic household.\n\nSuch a family has an abundance of rice and wheat bread, also of\nchicken and fish with occasional fresh beef. They have also a good\ndeal of dulce. They regularly serve wine and frequently serve beer\non their tables.\n\nIn strong contrast with this mode of life is that of the tao. His\ndiet consists almost wholly of rice and small uncleaned fish boiled\ntogether. As a rule knife, fork, plate, and spoon find no place in his\nhousehold. The rice and fish are boiled in a pot and then allowed to\ncool in the same vessel or poured out to cool in a large earthen or\nwooden bowl. Then Mr. Tao together with Mrs. Tao and all the young\nTaos squat on their heels around the mixture and satisfy that\nintangible thing called the appetite. They do not use chop sticks as\nthe Chinese do, but the rice and fish are caught in a hollow formed by\nthe first three fingers of the right hand. The thumb is then placed\nbehind the mass. It is raised up and poised before the mouth, with a\nskill coming from the evolution of ages, when a contraction of the\nmuscles of the thumb throws the mass into the mouth with a skill that\nis marvelous to any but a Filipino. To judge from the most reliable\ninformation, the poorest class do not have an abundance of food,\nalthough it would seem that such a condition of things would be\nwell-nigh impossible. However, in a census of one hundred school\nchildren there were found six boys and four girls who declared that\nthey had never had enough to eat, and the native teacher stated that\nthis was probably true.\n\nThe wide gulf between the tao and the rich man is filled by the\ngreat middle class of Filipinos.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VIII. - VISIT TO A LEPER COLONY.\n\n\nNot far from our town was a leper colony and the first Saturday that\ncould be spared was set aside for a trip to the place. It happened\nthat none of the other Americans were at leisure on this particular\nmorning, but, rather then delay the trip or miss it altogether, the\nwriter, armed with a revolver, started out alone.\n\nThe road had been described so accurately by one who was supposed to\nknow it that it was deemed well-nigh impossible to miss the way. The\nmain highway was followed to the point where the by-path supposed to\nlead to the settlement turned off through some bamboo thickets and a\nlow tropical wood. This path led straight away towards the sea-coast\nwhere the houses of the colony were said to stand in a cocoanut grove\nby the beach.\n\nUpon arriving at the settlement, a very inhospitable reception was\nreceived from a mangy cur that growled and showed a very uninviting\nset of sharp, white teeth behind his snarling lips. The growling of\nthe dog had attracted the attention of an old man who, with age-bent\nback, was pounding rice in a mortar about fifty yards away. He turned\nslowly around and, upon seeing an intruder into the primitive quiet of\nthe place, gave a sharp, far-reaching call. The sound had scarcely\nrung through the grove when from about a dozen of the little grass\nhouses dotted here and there fifteen or twenty men armed with bolos\ncame out and gathered around the old man. A sense of my danger flashed\nupon me. Three miles from town and alone in a tropical jungle, I could\nbe almost instantly overcome by this band of bolo-men, and the only\nreport that would ever reach my people would be that I had\n\"disappeared.\" Of course, attack was by no means certain, but the\npotentiality of the situation was thrilling. A drawn revolver and the\ngleaming of its shining barrel had the effect of stopping the men, who\nseemed to be hesitating as to a course of action, until a somewhat\ndignified retreat was made to an open space in the rear from where a\nless dignified and a more hasty retreat began which did not stop short\nof Bacalod.\n\nEnough had been seen, however, even in this short visit, to give\nconvincing proof that the settlement visited was no colony of lepers;\nso, that afternoon two servant boys being taken as guides and\ninterpreters, another attempt was made to reach the goal desired.\n\nThis attempt was successful, and, after about two hours of walking, a\nlittle cluster of grass huts snugly hidden by the sea-coast came into\nview. As we approached, one would have thought it a gala-day. Some few\nchildren, apparently from six to thirteen years of age, almost wholly\nnude, were romping and playing in the open space around which the huts\nstood, and no one would ever have thought that any cloud so horrible\nas leprosy could hover over a place apparently so happy.\n\nBy the side of the path as we passed was a man and his wife setting\nout potato plants. His hands were so puffed and his fingers so short\nthat he could scarcely use them, but he was working along as best he\ncould. His wife's feet were so swollen and twisted that she walked\nonly with the greatest difficulty. We passed them by and entered the\nopen space above referred to.\n\nThe children now saw us, and those of them who could darted away like\nfrightened rabbits, each to his own burrow. An old man who was sitting\nin the warm afternoon sun on the little bamboo platform before his hut\nwas aroused from his lethargic repose by the scampering away of the\nchildren. He arose, trembling upon his tottering limbs, all drawn and\ntwisted, and hobbled away into his hut.\n\nThe children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at\nthe doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of\nthe settlement. In a few moments we were surrounded by a circle of\nhuman beings at once so repulsive and so pitiable that its graphic\nvividness can never be accurately portrayed.\n\nThe old man referred to above, having put on a pair of snow-white\npantaloons, appeared now at the doorway of his hut, followed a few\nmoments later by his wife who had evidently clothed herself in the\nbest raiment she had. At a call from the old man, all the men, women,\nand children in the settlement came out of their huts and stood in a\nline before us. The old man was spokesman and in his native visayan\ntongue made a heart-rending appeal for aid which we were powerless to\ngive. Attention was called to a leper woman, apparently about\ntwenty-five years of age, whose face had been attacked by the disease\nand whose appearance was truly pathetic. Upon her hip was a child\nabout a year and a half old and, strange to say, the child showed as\nyet no signs whatever of the disease.\n\nWhat an indissoluble enigma is life! Here in a little cluster of grass\nhuts in a secluded nook of a secluded island of an all but secluded\narchipelago was gathered together a little community of wretched\nnatives, driven by their loathsomeness from association with others\neven of the same half-savage race. Yet here, men and women loved and\nwere married, by mutual trust if not by law, and children were born of\nthe union to live forever under the unspeakable horror that\novershadowed the unfortunate parents. Love, hatred, sorrow, and\njoy--every passion that enters into the complex structure of the human\nheart even here, in this scene of sadness and despair, was playing\napparently as freely as where misfortune and disease had never crossed\nthe portals of life.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER IX. - A \"HIKE.\"\n\n\nWe were lounging lazily in our hammocks at Jimamaylan one evening in\nApril. Supper was just ended, and the soldiers in the post were\ncollected in groups here and there spinning yarns to pass away the\ntime, when a Filipino clad only in a loin cloth came down the street\nat a steadily swinging run and stopped in front of the sentry. He\nbrought the announcement that a band of ladrones had just burned a\nsugar mill and were advancing to sack a barrio about fifteen miles\naway.\n\nThe invitation of the commanding officer to go on a \"hike\" was eagerly\naccepted, and, in ten minutes after the message was given, the troops\nwere on the march followed by two adventurous pedagogues.\n\nDarkness was just closing in as we left the town, but a resplendent\ntropic moon soon made the night almost as brilliant as the day. The\ntrail we followed led over rough and rocky country. Sometimes for a\ndistance of a mile or more we passed over barren wastes of volcanic\nslag poured out in anger by some peak whose convulsions have long\nsince ceased. Again we would descend into a tropical jungle from the\ndense foliage of which the ladrones could have leaped at any moment,\nhad they known of our coming, and annihilated our little band. We\nforded rapid streams with the water at our breasts, and halted only\nonce in that rapid march of fifteen miles.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the town we met a man who was standing\nguard against a surprise by the ladrones. Nothing could well have been\nmuch more grotesque and nothing could much better illustrate the\nabsolutely primitive condition of the Filipinos in the interior of the\nislands than the appearance of this guard. A pair of knee pants, a\nconical grass hat, and a hemp shirt formed his entire apparel. A long\nflat wooden shield, a bolo, and a long bamboo spear with a sharp,\nflat, iron point, completed his equipment for battle.\n\nHere stood the first and the twentieth centuries side by side. The\nFilipino who had advanced only a stage beyond the condition of\nprimitive man with his knife, spear, and wooden shield, stood side by\nside with the American soldier, a representative of modern life with\nhis magazine rifle, his canteen, his knapsack,--with every article of\nhis clothing made to give him the highest possible efficiency as the\nunit of a military organization.\n\nA few yards farther on we met another guard equipped similarly to the\nfirst. Upon reaching the town, news had just been received that a\ndetachment of troops from another post had intercepted the ladrones\nand fought a skirmish with them. The ladrones had escaped and we set\nout in pursuit of them on a chase wilder than a Quixotic dream. We\nwound our way into the mountains behind the town, inquiring at every\ngrass hut we passed whether the band of ladrones had passed that way,\nbut only once was even a trace of them found. Then it was learned that\nat a certain place they had separated into groups of three or four and\ngone glimmering through the dream of things that were. This place was\nin a secluded nook of the mountains where in years gone by some\nadventurous Spaniard had erected a primitive water mill to grind his\nsugar-cane. We had now marched about twenty miles and the feet of the\npedagogues were a mass of blisters. They had reached the point where\nthat form of military maneuvering called \"hiking\" ceased to possess\nany alluring charms. So a native was persuaded to come out of his lone\nmountain hut and hitch up his carabao and cart. He was then made to\nget on the carabao's back, while the aforesaid pedagogues lay down on\nthe sugar-cane pulp that had been put into the body of the cart, and\nthe driver was instructed to start for the post we had left hours\nbefore, and not to stop until he got there. Being uncertain but that\nsome of the ladrones would learn of our having left the body of troops\nand would try the metal of our steel, we at first agreed that neither\nof us should go to sleep, but it was later decided that probably the\ndriver had no greater desire to cross the Styx than his passengers had\nand that in case of danger he would awaken us, so both took a revolver\nin each hand, stretched out supinely and went to sleep.\n\nSuch a sleep! The rough jolting of the cart over an almost impassable\nroad was never enough to break the spell of slumber. When we awoke the\nblazing tropic sun was past the midday mark of morning, shining full\ninto our unprotected and well-nigh blistered faces.\n\nA pack of dogs were heralding our approach to a little village at the\nfoot of the mountains where ponies were procured to take us back to\nthe post.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he insists, \"have stood the test of ages; and the plant\nevery where retained its name and credit: and one of our good\nherbarists, who had seen a wonderful case of a swoln spleen, so big, and\nhard as to be felt with terror, brought back to a state of nature by it\"\n\n(p. 37). The greatest portion of Hill's concluding section combines\nadvertisement for the powder medicine he was himself manufacturing at a\nhandsome profit together with a protest against competing apothecaries:\n\"An intelligent person was directed to go to the medicinal herb shops in\nthe several markets, and buy some of this Spleen-wort; the name was\nwritten, and shewn to every one; every shop received his money, and\nalmost every one sold a different plant, under the name of this: but\nwhat is very striking, not one of them the right\" (p. 42).\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis did not cease to be printed after Hill's in\n1766, but continued to issue from the presses into the nineteenth\ncentury. A good example of this is the tome by John Reid, physician to\nthe Finsbury Dispensary in London, Essays on Insanity, Hypochondriasis\nand Other Nervous Affections (1816), which summarizes theories of the\nmalady. A bibliographical study of such works would probably reveal\na larger number of titles in the nineteenth century than in the previous\none, but by this time the nature and definition of hypochondria had\nchanged significantly.\n\nIf John Hill's volume is not an important contribution in the history of\nmedicine, it is a lucid and brief exposition of many of the best ideas\nthat had been thought and written on the hyp, with the exception of his\nuninhibited prescribing of herbal medicines as cure-alls. An\nunderstanding of this disease is essential for readers of neoclassical\nEnglish literature, especially when we reflect upon the fact that some\nof the best literature of the period was composed by writers whom it\nafflicted. It is perhaps not without significance that the greatest poet\nof the Augustan age, Alexander Pope, thought it necessary as he lay on\nhis deathbed in May 1744 to exclaim with his last breath, \"I never was\nhippish in my whole life.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. I. - The NATURE of the DISORDER.\n\n\nTo call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and cruel. It\nis a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by thickened\nand distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver, and other\nparts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick scarce knows\none more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\n\nThe blood is a mixture of many fluids, which, in a state of health, are\nso combined, that the whole passes freely through its appointed vessels;\nbut if by the loss of the thinner parts, the rest becomes too gross to\nbe thus carried through, it will stop where the circulation has least\npower; and having thus stopped it will accumulate; heaping by degrees\nobstruction on obstruction.\n\nHealth and chearfulness, and the quiet exercise of mind, depend upon a\nperfect circulation: is it a wonder then, when this becomes impeded the\nbody looses of its health, and the temper of its sprightliness? to be\notherwise would be the miracle; and he inhumanly insults the afflicted,\nwho calls all this a voluntary frowardness. Its slightest state brings\nwith it sickness, anguish and oppression; and innumerable ills follow\nits advancing steps, unless prevented by timely care; till life itself\ngrows burthensome.\n\nThe disease was common in antient Greece; and her physicians understood\nit, better than those perhaps of later times, in any other country; who\nthough happy in many advantages these fathers of the science could not\nhave, yet want the great assistance of frequent watching it in all its\nstages.\n\nThose venerable writers have delivered its nature, and its cure: in the\nfirst every thing now shews they were right; and what they have said as\nto the latter will be found equally true and certain. This, so far as\npresent experience has confirmed it, and no farther, will be here laid\nbefore the afflicted in a few plain words.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. II. - Persons Subject to it.\n\n\nFatigue of mind, and great exertion of its powers often give birth to\nthis disease; and always tend to encrease it. The finer spirits are\nwasted by the labour of the brain: the Philosopher rises from his study\nmore exhausted than the Peasant leaves his drudgery; without the benefit\nthat he has from exercise. Greatness of mind, and steady virtue;\ndetermined resolution, and manly firmness, when put in action, and\nintent upon their object, all also lead to it: perhaps whatever tends to\nthe ennobling of the soul has equal share in bringing on this weakness\nof the body.\n\nFrom this we may learn easily who are the men most subject to it; the\ngrave and studious, those of a sedate temper and enlarged understanding,\nthe learned and wise, the virtuous and the valiant: those whom it were\nthe interest of the world to wish were free from this and every other\nillness; and who perhaps, except for this alloy, would have too large a\nportion of human happiness.\n\nThough these are most, it is not these alone, who are subject to it.\n\nThere are countries where it is endemial, and in other places some have\nthe seeds of it in their constitution; and in some it takes rise from\naccidents. In these last it is the easiest of cure; and in the first\nmost difficult.\n\nBeside the Greeks already named, the Jews of old time were heavily\nafflicted with this disease; and in their descendants to this day it is\noften constitutional: the Spaniards have it almost to a man; and so have\nthe American Indians. Perhaps the character of these several nations may\nbe connected with it. The steady honour, and firm valour of the\nSpaniard, very like that of the ancient Doric nation, who followed the\nflute not the trumpet to the field; and met the enemy, not with shouts\nand fury, but with a determined virtue: it is the temper of the\nHypochondriac to be slow, but unmoveably resolved: the Jew has shewn\nthis mistakenly, but almost miraculously; and the poor Indian, untaught\nas he is, faces all peril with composure, and sings his death-song with\nan unalter'd countenance.\n\nAmong particular persons the most inquiring and contemplative are those\nwho suffer oftenest by this disease; and of all degrees of men I think\nthe clergy. I do not mean the hunting, shooting, drinking clergy, who\nbear the tables of the great; but the retir'd and conscientious; such as\nattend in midnight silence to their duty; and seek in their own cool\nbreasts, or wheresoever else they may be found, new admonitions for an\nage plunged in new vices. To this disease we owe the irreparable loss of\nDr. YOUNG; and the present danger of many other the best and most\nimproved amongst us. May what is here to be proposed assist in their\npreservation!\n\nThe Geometrician or the learned Philosopher of whatever denomination,\nwhose course of study fixes his eye for ever on one object, his mind\nintensely and continually employed upon one thought, should be warned\nalso that he is in danger; or if he find himself already afflicted, he\nshould be told that the same course of life, which brought it on, will,\nwithout due care, encrease it to the most dreaded violence.\n\nThe middle period of life is that in which there is the greatest danger\nof an attack from this disease; and the latter end of autumn, when the\nsummer heats have a little time been over, is the season when in our\nclimate its first assaults are most to be expected. The same time of the\nyear always increases the disorder in those who have been before\nafflicted with it; and it is a truth must be confessed, that from its\nfirst attack the patient grows continually, though slowly, worse; unless\na careful regimen prevent it.\n\nThe constitutions most liable to this obstruction are the lean, and dark\ncomplexioned; the grave and sedentary. Let such watch the first\nsymptoms; and obviate, (as they may with ease) that which it will be\nmuch more difficult to remove.\n\nIt is happy a disease, wherein the patient must do a great deal for\nhimself, falls, for the most part, upon those who have the powers of\nreason strongest. Let them only be aware of this, that the distemper\nnaturally disposes them to inactivity; and reason will have no use\nunless accompanied with resolution to enforce it.\n\nThough the physician can do something toward the cure, much more depends\nupon the patient; and here his constancy of mind will be employed most\nhappily. No one is better qualified to judge on a fair hearing what\ncourse is the most fit; and having made that choice, he must with\npatience wait its good effects. Diseases that come on slowly must have\ntime for curing; an attention to the first appearances of the disorder\nwill be always happiest; because when least established it is easiest\noverthrown: but when that happy period has been neglected, he must wait\nthe effects of such a course as will dilute and melt the obstructing\nmatter gradually; for till that be done it is not only vain, but\nsometimes dangerous, to attempt its expulsion from the body.\n\nThe blood easily separates itself into the grosser and the thinner\nparts: we see this in bleeding; and from the toughness of the red cake\nmay guess how very difficult it will be to dissolve a substance of like\nfirmness in the vessels of the body. That it can thus become thickened\nwithin the body, a Pleurisy shews us too evidently: in that case it is\nbrought on suddenly, and with inflammation; in this other, slowly and\nwithout; and here, even before it forms the obstruction, can bring on\nmany mischiefs. Various causes can produce the same effect, but that in\nall cases operates most durably, which operates most slowly. The watery\npart of the blood is its mild part; in the remaining gross matter of it,\nare acrid salts and burning oils, and these, when destitute of that\nhappy dilution nature gives them in a healthy body, are capable of doing\ngreat mischief to the tender vessels in which they are kept stagnant.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. III. - The SYMPTOMS of the DISORDER.\n\n\nThe first and lightest of the signs that shew this illness are a lowness\nof spirits, and inaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love\nof solitude and a habit of thinking, even on trifling subjects, with too\nmuch steadiness. A very little help may combat these: but if that\nindolence which is indeed a part of the disorder, will neglect them;\nworse must be expected soon to follow.\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness, weight, and oppression in the body,\na want of appetite, or, what is worse, an appetite without digestion;\nfor these are the conditions of different states of the disease, a\nfullness and a difficulty of breathing after meals, a straitness of the\nbreast, pains and flatulencies in the bowels, and an unaptness to\ndischarge their contents.\n\nThe pulse becomes low, weak, and unequal; and there are frequent\npalpitations of the heart, a little dark-coloured urine is voided at\nsome times; and a flood of colourless and insipid at others; relieving\nfor a moment, but increasing the distemper: there is in some cases also\na continual teazing cough, with a choaking stoppage in the throat at\ntimes; then heartburn, sickness, hardness of the belly, and a costive\nhabit, or a tormenting and vain irritation.\n\nThe lips turn pale, the eyes loose their brightness and by degrees the\nwhite grows as it were greenish, the gums want their due firmness, with\ntheir proper colour; and an unpleasing foulness grows upon the teeth:\nthe inside of the mouth is pale and furred, and the throat dry and\nhusky: the colour of the skin is pale (though there are periods when the\nface is florid) and as the obstruction gathers ground, and more affects\nthe liver, the whole body becomes yellow, tawny, greenish, and at length\nof that deep and dusky hue, to which men of swift imagination have given\nthe name of blackness.\n\nThese symptoms do not all appear in any one period of the disease, or in\none case, but at one time or other all of them, as well as those which\nfollow: the flesh becomes cold to the touch, though the patient does not\nhimself perceive it; the limbs grow numbed and torpid, the breathing\ndull and slow, and the voice hollow; and usually the appetite in this\nperiod declines, and comes almost to nothing: night sweats come on,\nblack swellings appear on the veins, the flesh wastes and the breast\nbecomes flat and hollow: the mouth is full of a thin spittle, the head\nis dizzy and confus'd, and sometimes there is an unconquerable numbness\nin the organs of speech.\n\nI have known the temporary silence that follows upon this last symptom\nbecome a jest to the common herd; and the unhappy patient, instead of\ncompassion and assistance, receive the reproof of sullenness, from those\nwho should have known and acted better.\n\nAbout twenty years ago I met on a visit at Catthorpe in Leicestershire a\nyoung gentleman of distinguished learning and abilities, who at certain\ntimes was speechless. The vulgar thought it a pretence: and a jocose\nlady, where he was at tea with company, putting him as she said to a\ntrial, poured out a dish very strong and without sugar. He drank it and\nreturned the cup with a bow of great reserve, and his eye bent on the\nground: she then filled the cup with sugar, and pouring weak tea on it,\nsent it him: he drank that too, looked at her steadily, and blushed for\nher. The lady declared the man was dumb; the rest thought him perverse,\nand obstinate; but a constant and steady perseverance in an easy method\ncured him.\n\nAll these are miseries which the disease, while it retains its natural\nform, can bring upon the patient; and thus he will in time be worn out,\nand led miserably, though slowly, to the grave. Let him not indulge his\ninactivity so far as to give way to this, because it is represented as\nfar off; the disease may suddenly and frightfully change its nature; and\nswifter evils follow.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. IV. - The DANGER.\n\n\nWe have done with the obstruction considered in itself; but this, though\noften unsurmountable by art, at least by the methods now in use, will be\nsometimes broken through at once by nature, or by accidents; and bring\non fatal evils. These are strictly different diseases, and are no\notherway concerned here, than as the consequences of that of which we\nare treating.\n\nThe thick and glutinous blood which has so long stagnated in the spleen,\nwill have in that time altered its nature, and acquired a very great\ndegree of acrimony: while it lies dormant, this does no more mischiefs,\nthan those named already; but when violent exercise, a fit of outrageous\nanger, or any thing else that suddenly shocks and disturbs the frame,\nputs it in motion, it melts at once into a kind of liquid putrefaction.\n\nBeing now thin, it mixes itself readily with the blood again, and brings\non putrid fevers; destroys the substance of the spleen itself, or being\nthrown upon some other of the viscera, corrodes them, and leads on this\nway a swift and miserable death. If it fall upon the liver, its tender\npulpy substance is soon destroyed, jaundices beyond the help of art\nfirst follow, then dropsies and all their train of misery; if on lungs,\nconsumptions; if on the brain, convulsions, epilepsy, palsy, apoplexy;\nif on the surface, leprosy.\n\nThe intention of cure is to melt this coagulation softly, not to break\nit violently; and then to give it a very gentle passage through the\nbowels. There is no safe way for it to take but that; and even that when\nurged too far may bring on fatal dysenteries.\n\nLet none wonder at the sudden devastation which sometimes arises from\nthis long stagnant matter, when liquified too hastily: how long, how\nmany years the impacted matter will continue quiet in a schirrous tumour\nof the breast; but being once put in motion, whether from accident, or\nin the course of nature, what can describe; or what can stop its\nhavock!\n\nInstances of the other are too frequent. A nobleman the other day died\nparalytick: dissection shewed a spleen consumed by an abscess, formed\nfrom the dissolved matter of such an obstruction: and 'tis scarce longer\nsince, a learned gentleman, who had been several years lost to his\nfriends, by the extreams of a Hypochondriacal disorder, seem'd gradually\nwithout assistance to recover: but the lungs suffered while the spleen\nwas freed; and he died very soon of what is called a galloping\nconsumption.\n\nWhen the obstruction is great and of long continuance, if it be thus\nhastily moved, the consequence is, equally, a sudden and a miserable\ndeath, whether, like the matter of a cancer, it remains in its place; or\nlike that of a bad small pox, be thrown upon some other vital part.\n\nLet not the patient be too much alarmed; this is laid down to caution,\nnot to terrify him: it is fit he should know his danger, and attend to\nit; for the prevention is easy; and the cure, even of the most advanced\nstages, when undertaken by gentle means, is not at all impracticable: to\nassist the physician, let him look into himself, and recollect the\nsource of his complaint. This he may judge of from the following\nnotices.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. V. - The Causes of the HYPOCHONDRIASIS.\n\n\nThe obstruction which forms this disease, may take its origin from\ndifferent accidents: a fever ill cured has often caused it; or the\npiles, which had been used to discharge largely, ceasing; a marshy soil,\npoisoned with stagnant water, has given it to some persons; and altho'\nindolence and inactivity are oftenest at the root, yet it has arisen\nfrom too great exercise.\n\nReal grief has often brought it on; and even love, for sometimes that is\nreal. Study and fixed attention of the mind have been accused before;\nand add to these the stooping posture of the body, which most men use,\nthough none should use it, in writing and in reading. This has\ncontributed too much to it; but of all other things night studies are\nthe most destructive. The steady stillness, and dusky habit of all\nnature in those hours, enforce, encourage, and support that settled\ngloom, which rises from fixt thought; and sinks the body to the grave;\neven while it carries up the mind to heaven. He who would have his lamp\n        At midnight hour\n  Be seen in some high lonely tower,\nwill waste the flame of this unheeded life: and while he labours to\nunsphere the spirit of Plato will let loose his own.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VI. - The Cure of the HYPOCHONDRIASIS.\n\n\nLet him who would escape the mischiefs of an obstructed spleen, avoid\nthe things here named: and let him who suffers from the malady,\nendeavour to remember to which of them it has been owing; for half the\nhope depends upon that knowledge.\n\nNature has sometimes made a cure herself, and we should watch her ways;\nfor art never is so right as when it imitates her: sometimes the\npatient's own resolution has set him free. This is always in his power,\nand at all times will do wonders.\n\nThe bleeding of the piles, from nature's single efforts, has at once\ncured a miserable man; where their cessation was the cause of the\ndisorder. A leprosy has appeared upon the skin, and all the symptoms of\nthe former sickness vanished. This among the Jews happened often: both\ndiseases we know were common among them: and I have here seen something\nvery like it: Water-Dock has thrown out scorbutic eruptions, and all the\nformer symptoms of an Hypochondriacal disorder have disappeared:\nreturning indeed when these were unadvisedly struck in; but keeping off\nentirely when they were better treated. A natural purging unsuppressed\nhas sometimes done the same good office: but this is hazardous.\n\nIt is easy to be directed from such instances; only let us take the\nwhole along with us. Bleeding would have answered nature's purpose, if\nshe could not have opened of herself the h\u00e6morrhoidal vessels; but he\nwho should give medicines for that purpose, might destroy his patient by\ntoo great disturbance. If a natural looseness may perform the cure, so\nmay an artificial; when the original source of the disorder points that\nway. But these are helps that take place only in particular cases.\n\nThe general and universal method of cure must be by some mild and gently\nresolving medicine, under the influence of which the obstructing matter\nmay be voided that, or some other way with safety. The best season to\nundertake this is the autumn, but even here there must be caution.\n\nIn the first place, no strong evacuating remedy must be given; for that,\nby carrying off the thinner parts of the juices, will tend to thicken\nthe remainder; and certainly encrease the distemper. No acrid medicine\nmust be directed, for that may act too hastily, dissolve the impacted\nmatter at once, and let it loose, to the destruction of the sufferer; no\nantimonial, no mercurial, no martial preparation must be taken; in\nshort, no chymistry: nature is the shop that heaven has set before us,\nand we must seek our medicine there. The venerable ancients, who knew\nnot this new art, will lead us in the search; and (faithful relators as\nthey are of truth) will tell us whence we may deduce our hope; and what\nwe are to fear.\n\nBut prior to the course of any medicine, and as an essential to any good\nhope from it, the patient must prescribe himself a proper course of\nlife, and a well chosen diet: let us assist him in his choice; and speak\nof this first, as it comes first in order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VI. - Rules of Life for Hypochondriac Persons.\n\n\nAir and exercise, as they are the best preservers of health, and\ngreatest assistants in the cure of all long continued diseases, will\nhave their full effect in this; but there requires some caution in the\nchoice, and management of them. It is common to think the air of high\ngrounds best; but experience near home shews otherwise: the\nHypochondriac patient is always worse at Highgate even than in London.\n\nThe air he breathes should be temperate; not exposed to the utmost\nviolences of heat and cold, and the swift changes from one to the\nother; which are most felt on those high grounds. The side of a hill is\nthe best place for him: and though wet grounds are hurtful; yet let\nthere be the shade of trees, to tempt him often to a walk; and soften by\ntheir exhalation the over dryness of the air.\n\nThe exercise he takes should be frequent; but not violent. Motion\npreserves the firmness of the parts, and elasticity of the vessels; it\nprevents that aggregation of thick humours which he is most to fear. A\nsedentary life always produces weakness, and that mischief always\nfollows: weak eyes are gummy, weak lungs are clogged with phlegm, and\nweak bowels waste themselves in vapid diarrhoeas.\n\nLet him invite himself abroad, and let his friends invite him by every\ninnocent inducement. For me, I should advise above all other things the\nstudy of nature. Let him begin with plants: he will here find a\ncontinual pleasure, and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful\nthings; even of the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to\nwalk; and every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket,\nwill afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually\nin the air, and continually to change the nature and quality of the air,\nby visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the lawn, the\nheath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be abroad; and the\nunceasing variety of the subjects of his observation, will prevent his\nwalking hastily: he will pursue his studies in the air; and that\ncontemplative turn of mind, which in his closet threatened his\ndestruction, will thus become the great means of his recovery.\n\nIf the mind tire upon this, from the repeated use, another of nature's\nkingdoms opens itself at once upon him; the plant he is weary of\nobserving, feeds some insect he may examine; nor is there a stone that\nlies before his foot, but may afford instruction and amusement.\n\nEven what the vulgar call the most abject things will shew a wonderful\nutility; and lead the mind, in pious contemplation higher than the\nstars. The poorest moss that is trampled under foot, has its important\nuses: is it at the bottom of a wood we find it? why there it shelters\nthe fallen seeds; hides them from birds, and covers them from frost;\nand thus becomes the foster father of another forest! creeps it along\nthe surface of a rock? even there its good is infinite! its small roots\nrun into the stone, and the rains make their way after them; the moss\nhaving lived its time dies; it rots and with the mouldered fragments of\nthe stone forms earth; wherein, after a few successions, useful plants\nmay grow, and feed more useful cattle!\n\nIs there a weed more humble in its aspect, more trampled on, or more\ndespised than knot grass! no art can get the better of its growth, no\nlabour can destroy it; 'twere pity if they could, for the thing lives\nwhere nothing would of use to us; and its large and most wonderfully\nabundant seeds, feed in hard winters, half the birds of Heaven.\n\nWhat the weak moss performs upon the rock the loathed toadstool brings\nabout in timber: is an oak dead where man's eye will not find it? this\nfungus roots itself upon the bark, and rots the wood beneath it; hither\nthe beetle creeps for shelter, and for sustenance; him the woodpecker\nfollows as his prey; and while he tears the tree in search of him, he\nscatters it about the ground; which it manures.\n\nNor is it the beetle alone that thus insinuates itself into the\nsubstance of the vegetable tribe: the tender aphide, whom a touch\ndestroys, burrows between the two skins of a leaf, for shelter from his\nwinged enemies; tracing, with more than Dedal\u00e6an art, his various\nmeanders; and veining the green surface with these white lines more\nbeautifully than the best \u00c6gyptian marble.\n\n'Twere endless to proceed; nor is it needful: one object will not fail\nto lead on to another, and every where the goodness of his God will\nshine before him even in what are thought the vilest things; his\ngreatness in the lead of them.\n\nLet him pursue these thoughts, and seek abroad the objects and the\ninstigations to them: but let him in these and all other excursions\navoid equally the dews of early morning, and of evening.\n\nThe more than usual exercise of this prescription will dispose him to\nmore than customary sleep, let him indulge it freely; so far from\nhurting, it will help his cure.\n\nLet him avoid all excesses: drink need scarce be named, for we are\nwriting to men of better and of nobler minds, than can be tempted to\nthat humiliating vice. Those who in this disorder have too great an\nappetite, must not indulge it; much eaten was never well digested: but\nof all excesses the most fatal in this case is that of venery. It is the\nexcess we speak of.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VII. - The proper DIET.\n\n\nIn the first place acids must be avoided carefully; and all things that\nare in a state of fermentation, for they will breed acidity. Provisions\nhardened by salting never should be tasted; much less those cured by\nsmoaking, and by salting. Bacon is indigestible in an Hypochondriac\nstomach; and hams, impregnated as is now the custom, with acid fumes\nfrom the wood fires over which they are hung, have that additional\nmischief.\n\nMilk ought to be a great article in the diet: and even in this there\nshould be choice. The milk of grass-fed cows has its true quality: no\nother. There are a multitude of ways in which this may be made a part\nboth of our foods and drinks, and they should all be used.\n\nThe great and general caution is that the diet be at all times of a kind\nloosening and gently stimulating; light but not acrid. Veal, lamb,\nfowls, lobsters, crabs, craw-fish, fresh water fish and mutton broth,\nwith plenty of boiled vegetables, are always right; and give enough\nvariety.\n\nRaw vegetables are all bad: sour wines, old cheese, and bottled beer are\nthings never to be once tasted. Indeed much wine is wrong, be it of what\nkind soever. It is the first of cordials; and as such I would have it\ntaken in this disease when it is wanted: plainly as a medicine, rather\nthan a part of diet. Malt liquor carefully chosen is certainly the best\ndrink. This must be neither new, nor tending to sourness; perfectly\nclear, and of a moderate strength: it is the native liquor of our\ncountry, and the most healthful.\n\nToo much tea weakens; and even sugar is in this disorder hurtful: but\nhoney may supply its place in most things; and this is not only harmless\nbut medicinal; a very powerful dissolvent of impacted humours, and a\ngreat deobstruent.\n\nWhat wine is drank should be of some of the sweet kinds. Old Hock has\nbeen found on enquiry to yield more than ten times the acid of the sweet\nwines; and in red Port, at least in what we are content to call so,\nthere is an astringent quality, that is most mischievous in these cases:\nit is said there is often alum in it: how pregnant with mischief that\nmust be to persons whose bowels require to be kept open, is most\nevident. Summer fruits perfectly ripe are not only harmless but\nmedicinal; but if eaten unripe they will be very prejudicial. A light\nsupper, which will leave an appetite for a milk breakfast, is always\nright; this will not let the stomach be ravenous for dinner, as it is\napt to be in those who make that their only meal.\n\nOne caution more must be given, and it may seem a strange one: it is\nthat the patient attend regularly to his hours of eating. We have to do\nwith men for the most part whose soul is the great object of their\nregard; but let them not forget they have a body.\n\nThe late Dr. STUKELY has told me, that one day by appointment visiting\nSir ISAAC NEWTON, the servant told him, he was in his study. No one was\npermitted to disturb him there; but as it was near dinner time, the\nvisitor sat down to wait for him. After a time dinner was brought in; a\nboil'd chicken under a cover. An hour pass'd, and Sir ISAAC did not\nappear. The doctor eat the fowl, and covering up the empty dish, bad\nthem dress their master another. Before that was ready, the great man\ncame down; he apologiz'd for his delay, and added, \"give me but leave to\ntake my short dinner, and I shall be at your service; I am fatigued and\nfaint.\" Saying this, he lifted up the cover; and without any emotion,\nturned about to STUKELY with a smile; \"See says he, what we studious\npeople are, I forgot I had din'd.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VIII. - The MEDICINE.\n\n\n'Tis the ill fate of this disease, more than of all others to be\nmisunderstood at first, and thence neglected; till the physician shakes\nhis head at a few first questions. None steals so fatally upon the\nsufferer: its advances are by very slow degrees; but every day it grows\nmore difficult of cure.\n\nThat this obstruction in the spleen is the true malady, the cases\nrelated by the antients, present observation, and the unerring\ntestimonies of dissections leave no room to doubt. Being understood, the\npath is open where to seek a remedy: and our best guides in this, as in\nthe former instance, will be those venerable Greeks; who saw a thousand\nof these cases, where we see one; and with less than half our theory,\ncured twice as many patients.\n\nOne established doctrine holds place in all these writers; that whatever\nby a hasty fermentation dissolves the impacted matter of the\nobstruction, and sends it in that state into the blood, does incredible\nmischief: but that whatever medicine softens it by slow degrees, and, as\nit melts, delivers it to the bowels without disturbance; will cure with\nequal certainty and safety.\n\nFor this good purpose, they knew and tried a multitude of herbs; but in\nthe end they fixed on one: and on their repeated trials of this, they\nbanished all the rest. This stood alone for the cure of the disease; and\nfrom its virtue received the name of SPLEEN-WORT. O wise and happy\nGreeks! authors of knowledge and perpetuators of it! With them the very\nname they gave a plant declared its virtues: with us, a writer calls a\nplant from some friend; that the good gardener who receives the honour,\nmay call another by his name who gave it. We now add the term smooth\nto this herb, to distinguish it from another, called by the same general\nterm, though not much resembling it.\n\nThe virtues of this smooth Spleen-wort have flood the test of ages; and\nthe plant every where retained its name and credit: and one of our good\nherbalists, who had seen a wonderful case of a swoln spleen, so big, and\nhard as to be felt with terror, brought back to a state of nature by it;\nand all the miserable symptoms vanish; thought Spleen-wort not enough\nexpressive of its excellence; but stamp'd on it the name of MILT-WASTE.\n\nIn the Greek Islands now, the use of it is known to every one; and even\nthe lazy monks who take it, are no longer splenetic. In the west of\nEngland, the rocks are stripped of it with diligence; and every old woman\ntells you how charming that leaf is for bookish men: in Russia they use\na plant of this kind in their malt liquor: it came into fashion there\nfor the cure of this disease; which from its constant use is scarce\nknown any longer; and they suppose 'tis added to their liquor for a\nflavour.\n\nThe ancients held it in a kind of veneration; and used what has been\ncalled a superstition in the gathering it. It was to be taken up with a\nsharp knife, without violence, and laid upon the clean linen: no time\nbut the still darkness of the night was proper, and even the moon was\nnot to shine upon it. I know they have been ridiculed for this; for\nnothing is so vain as learned ignorance: but let me be permitted once to\nvindicate them.\n\nThe plant has leaves that can close in their sides; and their under part\nis covered thick with a yellow powder, consisting of the seeds, and seed\nvessels: in these they knew the virtue most resided: this was the golden\ndust they held so valuable; and this they knew they could not be too\ncautious to preserve. They were not ignorant of the sleep of plants; a\nmatter lately spoken of by some, as if a new discovery; and being\nsensible that light, a dry air, an expanded leaf, and a tempestuous\nseason, were the means of losing this fine dust; and knowing also that\ndarkness alone brought on that closing of the leaf which thence has\nbeen called sleep; and which helped to defend and to secure it, they\ntherefore took such time, and used such means as could best preserve the\nplant entire; and even save what might be scattered from it.--And now\nwhere is their superstition?\n\nFrom this plant thus collected they prepared a medicine, which in a\ncourse of forty days scarce ever failed to make a perfect cure.\n\nWe have the plant wild with us; and till the fashion of rough chemical\npreparations took off our attention from these gentler remedies, it was\nin frequent use and great repute. I trust it will be so again: and many\nthank me for restoring it to notice.\n\nSpleen-wort gives out its virtues freely in a tincture; and a small dose\nof this, mixing readily with the blood and juices, gradually dissolves\nthe obstruction; and by a little at a time delivers its contents to be\nthrown off without pain, from the bowels. Let this be done while the\nviscera are yet sound and the cure is perfect. More than the forty days\nof the Greek method is scarce ever required; much oftener two thirds of\nthat time suffice; and every day, from the first dose of it, the patient\nfeels the happy change that is growing in his constitution. His food no\nmore turns putrid on his stomach, but yields its healthful nourishment.\n\nThe swelling after meals therefore vanishes; and with that goes the\nlowness, and anxiety, the difficult breath, and the distracting cholick:\nhe can bear the approach of rainy weather without pain; he finds himself\nmore apt for motion, and ready to take that exercise which is to be\nassistant in his cure; life seems no longer burthensome. His bowels get\ninto the natural condition of health, and perform their office once at\nleast a day; better if a little more: the dull and dead colour of his\nskin goes off, his lips grow red again, and every sign of health\nreturns.\n\nLet him who takes the medicine, say whether any thing here be\nexaggerated. Let him, if he pleases to give himself the trouble, talk\nover with me, or write to me, this gradual decrease of his complaints,\nas he proceeds in his cure. My uncertain state of health does not\npermit me to practise physic in the usual way, but I am very desirous to\ndo what good I can, and shall never refuse my advice, such as it may be,\nto any person rich or poor, in whatever manner he may apply for it. I\nshall refer him to no apothecary, whose bills require he should be\ndrenched with potions; but tell him, in this as in all other cases,\nwhere to find some simple herb; which he may if he please prepare\nhimself; or if he had rather spare that trouble, may have it so prepared\nfrom me.\n\nWith regard to Spleen-wort, no method of using it is more effectual than\nsimply taking it in powder; the only advantage of a tincture, is that a\nproper dose may be given, and yet the stomach not be loaded with so\nlarge a quantity: it is an easier and pleasanter method, and nothing\nmore.\n\nIf any person choose to take it in the other way, I should still wish\nhim once at least to apply to me; that he may be assured what he is\nabout to take is the right plant. Abuses in medicines are at this time\nvery great, and in no instance worse than what relates to herbs. The\nbest of our physicians have complained upon this head with warmth, but\nwithout redress: they know the virtues and the value of many of our\nnative plants, but dread to prescribe them; lest some wrong thing should\nbe administered in their place; perhaps inefficacious, perhaps\nmischievous, nay it may be fatal. The few simple things I direct are\nalways before me; and it will at all times be a pleasure to me, in this\nand any other instance, to see whether what any person is about to take\nbe right. I have great obligations to the public, and this is the best\nreturn that I know how to make.\n\nTo see the need of such a caution, hear a transaction but of yesterday!\n\nAn intelligent person was directed to go to the medicinal herb shops in\nthe several markets, and buy some of this Spleen-wort; the name was\nwritten, and shewn to every one; every shop received his money, and\nalmost every one sold a different plant, under the name of this: but\nwhat is very striking, not one of them the right. Such is the chance of\nhealth in those hands through which the best means of it usually pass;\neven in the most regular course of application.\n\nI would not be understood to limit the little services I may this way be\nable to render the afflicted, to this single instance; much less to\npropose to myself any advantages from it. Whoever pleases will be\nwelcome to me, upon any such occasion; and whatever be the herb on which\nhe places a dependance, he shall be shewn it growing. I once recommended\na garden to be established for this use, at the public expence: one\ngreat person has put it in my power to answer all its purposes.\n\n                        F  I  N  I  S.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris, he was\n\"nominated\" to the Academy. He had but to present an Historical\nPainting in order to take his seat as an Academician.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VENUS AND MARRIAGE\n\n\nBack in his beloved Paris again; thrilled by the atmosphere and gaiety\nof its merry life; in the full vigour of manhood on the eve of his\nthirties; amongst congenial friends; done with the drudgery of winning\nto Academic honour, Boucher saw that the public were not falling over\neach other to purchase religious or historic pictures; he straightway\nturned his back upon these things, and on the edge of his thirtieth\nyear he gave to the world his \"Marriage of the Children of God with\nthe Children of Men,\" in which Venus is the avowed mistress of his\nadoration. It caused a fine stir, and greatly increased his repute.\n\nIn this picture he ends his Italian period and strikes his own\npersonal note. Both this and the \"Venus asking arms for Aeneas from\nVulcan,\" together with the \"Birth of Adonis\" and the \"Death of\nAdonis,\" of about the same period, still show Boucher strongly under\nthe influence of his master, Lemoyne. Indeed, the \"Birth\" and \"Death\nof Adonis,\" their record lost during the scuffle and confusion of the\nRevolution, for long hung side by side as pictures by Lemoyne, until,\nbeing cleaned about 1860, Boucher's initials were discovered upon\nthem, and, contemporary engravings being hunted up, still further\nproved their origin. But in the Venus that now figures in all his\nworks there is that flesh-painting of the nude, and that rosy touch\nupon the flesh of the female figure, that are a far more certain\nsignature of Boucher's handiwork than any written name.\n\nUnfortunately the Salons were closed during Boucher's earlier years\nuntil he was thirty-four, and the record of his work during these\nyears is difficult to follow; but with his service to Venus his\npersonal career begins, and the stream of his Venus-pieces steadily\nflows from his hands.\n\nHe came to her service rid of all prentice essays in craftsmanship, a\nfinished and consummate artist. He found in his subject a goddess to\nwhom he could devote his great and splendid gifts. He painted her\ndainty body with a radiant delight and a rare colour-sense such as\nFrance had never before seen or uttered. He remains to this day the\nfirst painter of the subtle, delicate, and elusive thing that is\nfemininity; he caught her allure, her charm, as he was to catch the\nfragrance and charm of children and flowers; and he set the statement\nof these things upon canvas as they have never been uttered.\n\nThe whole of his life long, Boucher gave himself up with equal and\npassionate devotion to work and to pleasure--working at his easel\noften twelve hours of his day without losing, to the end when the\nbrush fell from his dead fingers, his blitheness of heart or his\ngenerosity of act, and without weakening the pleasure-loving desires\nof his gadding spirit. Out of his splendid toil he made the means to\nindulge his tastes for pleasure; and the gratifying of his tastes in\nturn renewed and created the ideas that made the subjects of his\nartistry. He brought to all he did a joy in the doing that made of his\nvast labour one long pleasure--of his pleasures a riot of industry. He\nplayed as he toiled, scarce knowing which was play and which toil.\n\nThe gossip of his love-affairs makes no romantic story--they were but\ncommonplace ecstasies with unknown frail women. But hard as he worked\nand lived and played, he found time to get himself married in his\nthirtieth year to pretty seventeen-year-old Marie Jeanne Buseau, a\nlittle Parisian--and for love of her, so far as he understood the\nbusiness; for she brought him no dowry.\n\nThe young couple settled down for the next ten years in the Rue\nSaint-Thomas-du-Louvre. Here Boucher lived through his thirties.\n\nMadame was a pretty creature, if we had but Latour's pastel portrait\nalone to prove it. But the pretty features were the crown to as pretty\na body, for she sat often to her lord; and it is clear from his\ncorrespondence with a friend, Bachaumont, that she is the Psyche of\nhis illustrated fable--and Psyche runs much to the Altogether.\n\nMarriage, however, was not likely to imprison Boucher's gadding eyes;\nand it did not. Madame Boucher seems to have had as frail a heart, and\navoided strife by amusing herself, amongst others, with the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who, to gain access to the lady,\ncommissioned Boucher to do the Watteau-like illustrations to\nAcajou--a dull affair. Boucher's pretty wife, herself no mean\nartist, worked in his studio, and painted several smaller canvases\nafter his pictures, gaining some fame as a miniaturist and engraver.\n\nNor did Marriage turn Boucher from his art. Two years were gone by\nsince his nomination to the Academy; he had now to paint the formal\nHistorical Picture and present it in order to take his seat as\nAcademician; and it was in this his thirtieth year that he painted and\nwon his academic rank with the \"Renauld et Armide\" now at the Louvre.\n\nHere he sufficiently subordinated his own style to the academic to\nensure success; and the work was hailed by Academicians and critics,\nincluding Diderot, with enthusiasm. But even here we have his cupids\npeeping round the mythologic event; and Armide herself has pretty\nFrench lips that knew no Greek.\n\nOnce secure of his position, he straightway flung the last remnants of\nthe academic style out of his studio door; and it is a grim comment on\ncriticism that it was just exactly in proportion as he developed his\nown personal genius and uttered the France of his day, that he was\nattacked; whilst the stilted things that he knew were third-rate, and\nwhich he wholly rejected from henceforth, were exactly the things that\nwere praised!\n\nHis election to the Academy, and the enthusiasm over the picture that\nwon him his seat thereat, brought his name before the young king; the\nfollowing year he received his first order from the Court whose\npainter he was destined to become. The decorations in the queen's\napartments were gloomy and had grown black; and he painted in their\nstead the \"Charity,\" \"Abundance,\" \"Fidelity,\" and \"Prudence\" still\nthere to be seen. Indeed, with his gay vision, his pretty habit of\nculling only the flowers from the garden of life, and his quickness to\nset down the pleasing thing in every prospect, Boucher was the\ndestined painter of a Court weary of pomposity and the pose of the\nmock-heroic, and which was wholly giving itself up to pleasure and the\nelegances.\n\nBut neither his new dignity of Academician nor the royal favour, kept\nhim from the bookshops; and he illustrated, with rare beauty and a\ncharm worthy of Watteau, the great edition of the Works of Moli\u00e8re\nin his thirty-first year. It is true that he made as free with\nMoli\u00e8re's world as with the Gods of Olympus; he peoples the plays with\ncharacters of his own day, arrayed in the dress and habit of that day,\nand moving in surroundings that he saw about him.\n\n\nLE MONDE QUI S'AMUSE\n\n\nThe Homely had come upon the town out of Holland, painted with most\nconsummate artistry by Chardin, and was soon in the vogue. Boucher had\na quick eye for the mode. And he straightway set himself to the\npainting of \"La Belle Cuisini\u00e8re.\" Still-life and homely subjects need\nan accuracy of realism and a Dutch sense of these things, a sense of\nsincerity and an appreciation of the dignity of the work-a-day life of\nthe people, in which Boucher was wholly lacking. Above all, it calls\nfor a sense of \"character,\" which, in Boucher, was always weak. It was\na sneer against him that his very broomsticks called for pompons and\nribbons--and there was more than a little truth in the spite. He is\nmore concerned with the accident of the kissing of a kitchen-maid than\nwith the kitchen's habit. He cannot even peep into a scullery without\ndragging in Venus by the skirts, and tricking her out in a\nproperty-wardrobe of a scullery-wench, in which the girl is clearly\nbut acting the part.\n\nHowever, these passing vogues and experiments in different methods\nwere only gay asides--he was working the while upon his own subjects;\nand, to the display by its several members ordered by the Academy, he\nsent four little paintings of fauns and cupids which won him the\nhonour of election as deputy-professor. His brain and hand were very\nbusy, and he turns from one thing to another with amazing facility,\nbringing distinction to all that he does.\n\nBut he painted about this time two pictures of infants, \"L'Amour\nOiseleur\" and \"L'Amour Moissonneur,\" which were the beginning of that\nhost of cupids that he let fly from his studio; they frolic across his\ncanvases and join the retinue of Venus, peeping out from clouds, over\nwaves, round curtains, painted with a perfection that has never been\nsurpassed in the portrayal of infants. He painted their round limbs,\ntheir lusty life, their delightful awkwardnesses, their jolly fat\ngrace, their na\u00efve surprise at life and glory in it, as they had never\nbeen painted before, and have never been painted since.\n\nHe also gave forth in this his thirty-third year a \"Pastoral\" and a\n\"Shepherd and Shepherdess in Conversation,\" with sheep about them and\nin a pleasant landscape, which were his first essays in the style that\nhe created and which made him famous.\n\nHis friend Meissonnier, the inventor of the rococo, stood godfather to\nBoucher's first-born son in the May of 1736.\n\nFrom the very beginning Boucher seems to have been engraved. And these\nengravings, done by the best gravers of his day, greatly extended his\nreputation and popularised him; he fully realised the value of the\nadvertisement as well as his profits from it. Before his thirty-third\nyear was run out he published his well-known \"Cries of Paris.\"\n\nBoucher's description of them, \"studies from the low classes,\" holds\nthe key to that something of failure to realise the dramatic verities\nthat is over all; it gives also the attitude of the France that he\nknew towards the France that he did not, and could not understand. He\ncreated that dainty, pleasant atmosphere that comes floating up to the\nwindows on a fresh morning in Paris from the musical cries of\nthe street vendors; but of the deeper significance of the\nstreet-sellers--of the miserable accent in their life, of their weary\ntoil, of the dignity of their labour--he knew nothing; his brush could\nnot refrain from making elegance and fine manners peep from behind the\nstreet-porter's fustian or the milkmaid's skirt.\n\nBut his thirty-third year was to contain a more far-reaching\nsignificance even than the creation of his cupid-pieces and pastorals.\n\nThe \"Cries of Paris\" were scarce printed when Boucher's illustration\nto \"Don Quixote\" appeared--\"Sancho pursued by the servants of the\nDuke.\" This design was to have far-reaching results that Boucher\nlittle suspected.\n\nThe painter Oudry had been called to the conduct of the great tapestry\nlooms at Beauvais a couple of years before; and in his efforts to\nfurnish the looms with good designs, he now called Boucher to his aid,\nwhose original and fresh style, colour, and arrangement, together with\nhis personal vision, and the enthusiasm and zeal with which he threw\nhimself into the work, at once increased the reputation and the\nproducts of the famous looms. This large designing for the tapestries\nwas, in return, of immense value to the development of the genius of\nthe man, enlarging his breadth of style and giving scope to that great\ndecorative sense that was his superb gift. Thenceforth he was destined\nto play a supreme part in the history of the world-famed factories. He\nnow produced painting after painting for the Beauvais looms.\n\nLife is now one long triumph for Boucher, only disturbed in this year\nby the sad news of the suicide of his old master, Lemoyne. It was in\nthis, Boucher's thirty-fourth year, that the Salon was opened for the\nfirst time since Boucher's infancy, and he contributed several\ncanvases to it.\n\nRigaud, the old Academician, now close upon eighty, straggling through\nthe great galleries, might well blink and gasp at the change that had\ncome over French art since he last exhibited there, thirty-three years\ngone by; but his scoffs and regrets held no terrors for the younger\nAcademicians gathered about. He stood in a new world. A new generation\nwas in possession. The grand manner, the severe etiquette, formal\nmock-heroics, and solemn pomposity of Louis the Fourteenth were\nvanished, and the Agreeable and the Pleasant Make-Believe of Louis the\nFifteenth reigned in their stead. Old Rigaud might blink indeed! Just\nas the imposing and stilted etiquette of the reception-room had given\nplace to the easy manners and airy etiquette of the dainty boudoir, so\nhad light chatter and gay wit and the quick repartee usurped the heavy\nsplendours of a consequential age. France, weary of an eternal pose of\nthe grand manner, was seeking change in joyousness and amusement.\n\nGallantry and gaiety were become the object of the ambition of a\ndandified and elegant day. France became a coquette; dressed herself\nas a porcelain shepherdess; and with beribboned crook and sheep,\nseeking pleasant prospects to stroll through, gave herself to\ndalliance--her powder-puff and patch-box and fan a serious part of her\nunseriousness.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE CH\u00c2TEAUROUX\n\n\nAt thirty-five Boucher has arrived. He is in the vogue; in favour at\nCourt--as well as in the fashion. In his three years from taking his\nseat at the Academy to the opening of the first Salon he has created a\nnew and original style--his cupid pieces, his pastorals, his\nVenus-pieces, his tapestry. Boucher's kingdom lay in the realm of the\ndecorative painter--and he has found it. Torn from the surroundings\nfor which he designed them, as part and parcel of the general scheme,\nhis pictures are as out of place as an Italian altarpiece in an\nEnglish dining-room, yet they suffer less. Several may still be seen,\nas he set them up in frames of his own planning, as overdoors in the\npalace of the Soubise, now given up to the national archives.\n\nThe ghost of the Prince of Soubise, who commissioned them, may haunt\nhis palace, but his kin know the place no longer. The overdoors\nwrought by Boucher's skill look down now on the nation's collection of\nhistoric documents. The \"Three Graces enchaining Love,\" the fine\npastoral of \"The Cage,\" and the pastoral of the \"Shepherd placing a\nRose in his Shepherdess's Hair,\" were to see a mightier change than\nthe usurpation of Louis the Fourteenth's pompous age by the elegant\nyears of Louis the Fifteenth. But this was not as yet. Here at least\nwe see Boucher's art rid of all outside influences, and at the full\ntide of creation; here we have the inimitable lightness of touch, the\nfigures and landscape bathed in the airy volume of atmosphere.\n\nHe seems at this time to have played with pastel, due probably to his\nfriendship with Latour, who sent a portrait of Boucher's wife to this\nSalon. Boucher showed in the use of chalks the artistry and skill that\nwere always at his command.\n\nHe also was putting to its full use his innate sense of landscape,\nraising to high achievement that astonishing balance of landscape and\nfigures in his design--a balance that has never been surpassed; his\nfigures never override his landscape; his landscape never overpowers\nhis figures. His earnest counsels to his pupils and his constant\ndeploring of the lack of the landscape art in France prove the great\nstress he laid upon it.\n\nThe designing of a frontispiece for the catalogue of a personal\nfriend, one Gersaint, a merchant of oriental wares, started Boucher in\nhis thirty-third year upon that series of Chinese pictures and\ntapestries known as the \"Chinoiseries,\" in which he frittered away\nonly too many precious hours, for they were received with great favour\nby the public. The paintings of Chinese subjects designed for the\nlooms of Beauvais are still to be seen at Besan\u00e7on.\n\nBut busy as were his brain and hand in the exercise of his wide and\nversatile gifts, pouring out \"Chinoiseries,\" illustrations for books,\ntapestries on a large scale, landscapes, models for the gilt bronze\ndecorations of porcelain vases, scheming handsome frames for his\npictures, designing furniture and fans--Boucher was true, above all,\n\"to his goddess,\" and painted the famed \"Birth of Venus,\" which,\nthanks to the Swedish Ambassador's fondness for Madame Boucher, now\nhangs at Stockholm; our amorous Count de Tessin, to be just, seems to\nhave had a rare flair for the artistic--besides artist's wives. It was\non the 15th of April in 1742, the last year of his thirties, that the\nRoyal favour was marked by the grant of a pension of 400 livres\n(double florins) to Boucher with promise of early benefits to follow.\n\nTwo years afterwards it was raised to 600 livres.\n\nThis was the year that he painted the beautiful canvas of \"Diana\nleaving the Bath with one of her Companions,\" now at the Louvre. It\nwas also the year that saw his landscape, the \"Hamlet of Iss\u00e9\" at the\nSalon. This \"Hameau d'Iss\u00e9\" was to be enlarged for the Opera, proving\nhim to be decorator there, where he was arranging waterfalls,\ncascades, and the rest of the pretty business, without staying his\nhand from his art.\n\nAt forty Boucher has come into his kingdom. The ten years of these\nforties were to be a vast triumph for him. He was to produce\nmasterpiece after masterpiece. His art had caught the taste of the\nday. He was at the height of his powers. He had done great things--he\nwas to do greater. During these ten years of his forties he poured\nforth vivid and glowing works of sustained power and originality.\n\nWe have a picture of him as he was in the flesh at this time--the\npastel portrait by Lundberg, now at the Louvre--a gay, somewhat\ndissipated, handsomely dressed dandy of the time, smiling out of his\ncareless day, the debonnair man of fashion, the laughing eyes showing\nsigns of the night carousals, which were the rest from the prodigious\ntoil of this vital and forthright spirit.\n\nIt was in this our artist's fortieth year that the gifted old Cardinal\nFleury, who had guided the fortunes of France with rare skill, died,\nbroken by his ninety years and the blunders of the disastrous war that\nhe had so strenuously opposed; and Louis, essaying the strut of\nkingship, became king by act. His indolent character, unequal to the\nmighty business, his indeterminate will fretted by the set of\nquarrelling and intriguing rogues that he gathered about him as his\nministers, he fell into the habit that became his thenceforth, the\nonly thing to which he paid the tribute of constancy--he ruled France\nfrom behind pretty petticoats. He had early shown the adulterous blood\nof his great-grandfather; two, if not three, of five sisters of the\nnoble and historic house of De Nesle had yielded to his gadding fancy;\nthe youngest now ousted her sister De Mailly from the king's favour,\nwas publicly acknowledged as the king's mistress, and became Duchess\nof Ch\u00e2teauroux. Boucher painted her handsome being as a shepherdess in\none of his pastorals. She was no ordinary toy of a king. A woman of\ntalent, with hot ambitions for the king's majesty, fired with the\npride of race of the old French noblesse, it was during her short\nyears of ascendancy over the king that he roused from his body's\ntorpor and made an effort to reach the dignity and eminence befitting\nto the lord of a great and gallant people. He stepped forth awhile\nfrom his drunken bouts and manifold mean adulteries, and set himself\nat the head of the army in Flanders, and strutted it as conqueror.\n\nPoor Ch\u00e2teauroux only got the hate of the people for reward, Louis the\nhonours; for the people resented the public dishonour of her state.\n\nPower she found to be a dead-sea apple in her pretty mouth. The glory\nof it all, the splendours, were not the easily won delights for which\nshe had looked. She had to fight a duel, that never ended, with the\nking's witty, crafty, and scurrilous Prime Minister, the notorious\nMaurepas--and Maurepas willed that no woman should ever come between\nhim and the king--Maurepas who knew no mercy, no decency, no chivalry,\nno scruple. At Ch\u00e2teauroux's urging, Louis placed himself at the\nhead of the army; and France went near mad with joy that she had\nagain found a king. Crafty Maurepas urged on the business; the\nCh\u00e2teauroux suddenly realised his cunning glee--it separated her from\nthe king.\n\nOut of the whirl of things Boucher's fortune was ripening, little as\nhe might suspect it.\n\nHe was painting masterpieces that make his name live. To his fortieth\nyear belong the famed \"Birth of Venus,\" the \"Venus leaving the Bath,\"\nthe \"Muse Clio,\" the \"Muse Melpomene,\" and the three well-known\npastorals now at the Louvre--\"The Sleeping Shepherdess,\" the \"Nest,\"\n\n\nand the \"Shepherd and Shepherdesses.\" Of the many famous Venus-pieces\nthat his hand painted during these years it is not easy to write the\nlist. But having signed the \"Marriage of Love and Psyche\" at\nforty-one, he turned his experimental hand to the homely, realistic\nDutch style that was having a wide vogue, and painted the\n\"Dejeuner\"--a family of the prosperous class of the day at\nbreakfast--showing with rare charm the surroundings and home life of\nthe well-to-do of his time.\n\nAll goes well with Boucher. He changes into better quarters in the Rue\nde Grenelle-Saint-Honor\u00e9, where he lived for the next five years,\nuntil 1749; but his eyes are fixed upon a studio and apartments at\nthe old palace of the Louvre, though the hard intriguing of his\npowerful friends at Court on his behalf failed for some time. He had,\nindeed, to make another move before he arrived at his longed-for goal.\n\nPensions Boucher, like others, had found to be somewhat empty affairs;\nbut rooms at the Louvre were a solid possession eagerly sought after\nby the artists.\n\nIn this year of 1744 Boucher created a new fashion at the annual Salon\nby sending studies and sketches instead of finished pictures; and it\nset a value upon such things not before realised by artists, for\nsuccess was instant and loud.\n\nTowards the end of the next, Boucher's forty-second year, the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who was to take his leave of Paris,\ncommissioned four pictures to represent the day of a woman of fashion,\nand to be entitled \"Morning,\" \"Midday,\" \"Evening,\" and \"Night.\"\n\nBoucher painted one of these for him, now known as the \"Marchande de\nModes.\" The others were painted later, and all had a wide vogue as\nengravings. The correspondence has interest since it reveals Boucher's\nbusiness habits; he was paid for a picture on its delivery, and for\neach of these he was to receive 600 livres (double florins or\ndollars)--about a hundred and twenty pounds.\n\nIn an official document of the Director of Buildings to the king (or\nMinister of Fine Art, as we should say), written in this year of 1745,\nBoucher being forty-two, is a \"list of the best painters,\" in which\nBoucher is singled out for distinction as \"an historic painter, living\nin the Rue de Grenelle-Saint-Honor\u00e9, opposite the Rue des Deux-Ecus,\npupil of Lemoyne, excelling also in landscape, grotesques, and\nornaments in the manner of Watteau; and equally skilled in painting\nflowers, fruit, architecture, and subjects of gallantry and of\nfashion.\"\n\nNot so bad for dry officialdom; the critics could learn a lesson. For\nhe was nothing less. What indeed does he not do? and wondrous well!\nthis painter of the age.\n\nAnd the mighty rush of events is about to sweep him into further\nprominence; the very things which he probably passed by with a gay\nshrug are to enrich him, to help him to his highest fulfilment.\n\nPoor Ch\u00e2teauroux saw that she must lose the king's gadding favour in\nthe conflict with Maurepas unless she joined her lord, now with the\narmy. She realised full well that she had created the new Louis of\nAmbition--that her going must bring the people's hate to her. But she\ndared not lose the king. And she went. Maurepas had overdone his\njibings. The indiscretion at once rang through the land; became the\njest of the army--and Maurepas was not far from the bottom of the\nbusiness. The discreet indiscretion of covered ways between the king's\nlodgings and hers only added to the mockeries, and increased the\npeople's hate against, of course, the Ch\u00e2teauroux. Then upon a day in\nAugust the small-pox seized Louis at Metz; poor Ch\u00e2teauroux fought for\npossession of the king in the sick room, until his fear of\ndeath--Louis' sole piety--sent her packing--shrinking back in the\nhired carriage at each halting-place for change of horses, lest she\nshould be seen and torn from her place and destroyed by the populace.\n\nBut Louis recovered; Paris rang with bells at joy on his recovery, and\nhe entered the city amidst mad enthusiasm, hailed as The Well-Beloved.\n\nHe sent for the Ch\u00e2teauroux to find her dying, Maurepas having to\ndeliver the message of recall. She died suddenly and in great agony,\nswearing that Maurepas had poisoned her--died in the arms of her poor\ndiscarded sister, the De Mailly.\n\nBut this year of 1745 Boucher hears a mightier scandal that is to mean\nvast things to all France--and not least of all to Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE POMPADOUR\n\n\nA young bride had become the gossip of the rich merchant society of\nParis--that class that was ousting the old noblesse from power. She\nwas a beautiful, a remarkable woman; her wit was repeated in the\ndrawing-rooms, she had all the accomplishments; her charming\nname--Madame Lenormant d'Etioles.\n\nDraw aside the curtains of the past and we discover our little Jeanne\nPoisson--grown into this exquisite creature. It has come about in\nstrange fashion enough. The father--a scandalous fellow--having\nfingered the commissariat moneys in ugly ways to his own use, had been\nbanished for the ugly business. Nor is Jeanne's mother any better than\nshe should be; and the wags wink knowingly at the handsome and rich\nman of fashion, Monsieur Lenormant de Tournehem, who has been the\nfavoured gallant during the absence of the light-fingered Poisson.\n\nAnd, of a truth, Lenormant de Tournehem takes astonishing interest in\nthe little Jeanne--watching over her up-growing and giving her the\nbest of education at the convent, where she wins all hearts, and is\nknown as \"the little queen.\" The truth spoken with wondrous prophecy,\nif unthinkingly, as we shall see. Complacent Poisson came home, and\ntook the rich and fashionable, bland and smiling Lenormant de\nTournehem to his arms. Has he not wealth and estates? therefore as\nexcellent a friend for Poisson as for Madame Poisson. The girl Jeanne\nleaves the convent to be taught the accomplishments by the supreme\nmasters of France, the wits foregather at Madame Poisson's, and the\nbrilliant Jeanne is soon mistress of the arts--coquetry not least of\nall; has also the most exquisite taste in dress. Under all is a heart\ncold as steel; calculating as the higher mathematics. She has but one\nhindrance to ambition--her mean birth. Lenormant de Tournehem rids her\neven of this slur by making his nephew, Lenormant d'Etioles, marry\nher, giving the young couple half his fortune for dowry, and the\npromise of the rest when he dies--also he grants him a splendid\ntown-house, as splendid a country seat. And consequential\nself-respecting little Lenormant d'Etioles is lord of Etioles, amongst\nother seignories. So Jane Fish appears as Madame Lenormant d'Etioles,\nseductive, beautiful, accomplished, to whose house repair the new\nphilosophy, the wits, and artists. She has a certain sense of virtue;\nindeed openly vows that no one but the king shall ever come between\nher and her lord. But, deep in her heart, she has harboured a fierce\nambition--that the king shall help her to keep her bond. She puts\nforth all her gifts, all her powers, to win to the strange goal;\nconfides it to her worldly mother and \"uncle,\" Lenormant de Tournehem;\nfinds keen allies therein to the reaching of that strange goal. The\ndeath of the Ch\u00e2teauroux clears the way. At a masked ball the king is\nintrigued as to the personality of a beautiful woman who plagues him\nwith her art; he orders the unmasking. Madame Lenormant d'Etioles\nstands revealed, drops her handkerchief as by accident; the whisper\nruns through the Court that \"the handkerchief has been thrown!\" The\nking stoops and picks it up. A few evenings later she is smuggled into\nthe \"private apartments.\" She goes again a month later; in the morning\nis seized with sudden terror--she daren't go back to her angry lord\nlest he do her grievous harm; he will have missed her. The king is\ntouched; allows her to hide from henceforth in the secret apartments;\npromises the beautiful creature a lodging, her husband's banishment,\nand early acknowledgment as titular mistress--before the whole Court\nat Easter, says the pious Great One. But he has to join the army to\nplay the Conqueror at Fontenoy; and it is later in the year\n(September) before Madame d'Etioles is presented to the Court in a\nvast company and proceeds to the queen's apartments to kiss hands on\nappointment. Thus was Jeanne Poisson raised to the great aristocracy\nof France in her twenty-third year as Marquise de Pompadour.\n\nBoucher had been one of the brilliant group of artists of the\nd'Etioles' circle. That the Pompadour's influence had much effect upon\nhis position at Court for a year or two is unlikely; for she had to\nfight for possession of the king day and night, as the Ch\u00e2teauroux\nhad done, against the queen's party and the unscrupulous enmity of\nMaurepas. To set down Boucher's favour at Court to her is ridiculous.\n\nHe was painting for the queen's apartments at thirty-one when the\nPompadour was a school-girl of twelve. But in the year following her\nrise to power, Boucher painted four pictures for the large room of the\nDauphin, which were \"placed elsewhere\"; and, the year after that, he\nwas at work upon two pictures for the bedroom of the king at the\ncastle of Marly. It is likely enough that the Pompadour directed this\norder. She had almost immediately secured the office of the\nDirector-General of Buildings, which covered the direction of the\nroyal art treasures, for \"uncle\" Lenormant de Tournehem, who was also\na friend of the artist. And from this year it is significant that\nBoucher paints no more for the opposing camp of the Queen and Dauphin.\n\nHe was now giving all his strength to the \"Rape of Europa\" that he\npainted for the competition ordered by the Academy at the command of\nLenormant de Tournehem in the king's name, in which ten chosen\nAcademicians were to paint subjects in their own style for six prizes\nand a gold medal, to be awarded in secret vote by the competing\nartists themselves. Boucher won, by his amiable nature, the good-will\nof them all by proposing that they should so arrange as to share the\nprizes equally, and thus prevent any sense of soreness inevitable in\nthe losers.\n\nBut greatly as he won the good-fellowship of his fellow-artists by it,\nthis picture caused a murmur to rise amongst the critics who,\naforetime loud in his praise, now began to complain of his \"abuse of\nrose tints\" in the painting of the female nude. The fact was that\nDiderot and the men of the New Philosophy were turning their eyes to\nthe whole foundations upon which France was built, art as well as\nsociety, and were beginning to demand of art \"grandeur and morality in\nits subjects.\" They were soon to be clamouring for \"the statement of a\ngreat maxim, a lesson for the spectator.\" Diderot, with bull-like\ncourage, picked out the greatest, and turned upon Boucher, blaming him\nfor triviality.\n\nThe nations, weary of war, concluded the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in\nthe October of 1748. No sooner was peace concluded than Louis\nrelapsed into his old habit of dandified indolence and profligate\nease; and, putting from him his duties as the lord of a great people,\nhe gave himself up to shameless intrigues. He allowed the Pompadour to\nusurp his magnificence and to rule over the land. He yielded himself\nutterly, if sometimes sulkily, to her domination; and for sixteen\nyears she was the most powerful person at Court, the greatest force in\nthe state--making and unmaking ministers, disposing of office,\nhonours, titles, pensions. All political affairs were discussed and\narranged under her guidance; ministers, ambassadors, generals\ntransacted their business in her stately boudoirs; the whole patronage\nof the sovereign was dispensed by her pretty hands; the prizes of the\nChurch, of the army, of the magistracy could be obtained solely\nthrough her favour and good-will. Her energy must have been\nprodigious. Possessed of extraordinary talents and exquisite tastes,\nshe gave full rein to them, and it was in the indulgence of her better\nqualities that Destiny brought Boucher into the friendship of this\nwonderful woman. She became not only his patron but his pupil,\nengraving several of his designs.\n\nBut this, her sovereignty over the king, easy and light in its outward\nseeming, was a haggard nightmare to the calculating woman who had so\nlonged for it. She knew no single hour's rest from the night she won\nto the king's bed. She had to fight her enemies, secret and open, for\npossession of the king's will, day and night; and she fought--with\nrare courage. She won by consummate skill and unending pluck. She made\nherself an essential part of the king's freedom from care. The Court\nparty fought her for power with constant vigilance. Maurepas brought\nall his unscrupulous art, all his ironic mimicry, all his vile jibes\nand unchivalrous hatred to bear against her. He had made himself a\nnecessity to the king; and he never slept away a chance of injuring\nher. He knew no mercy, no nobility, no pity. He made her the detested\nobject of the people. With his own hands he penned the witty verses\nand epigrams that were sung and flung about the streets of Paris.\n\nBut she had an enemy more subtle than any at the Court--hour by hour\nshe had to dispute the king with the king's boredom. And it was in the\neffort to do so that she created her celebrated theatre in the\nprivate apartments, calling Boucher and others to her aid in the doing\nof it. Here the noblest of France vied with each other to obtain the\nsmallest part to play, an instrument in its orchestra, an invitation\nto its performances.\n\nBoucher left the Opera to become its decorator in 1748, and did not\nreturn until her death. For her, he also decorated her beautiful rooms\nat Bellevue. She bought at high prices many of his greatest\nmasterpieces.\n\nThe Pompadour's power so greatly increased that she openly took\ncommand of the king's will; dared and succeeded in getting his\nfavourite Maurepas banished; and herself took to the use of the kingly\n\"we.\" Her rascally father was created Lord of Marigny; her brother,\nwhom the king liked well and called \"little brother,\" was created\nMarquis de Vandi\u00e8res; her only child, Alexandrine, signed her name as\na princess of the blood royal, and would have been married to the\nblood royal had she not caught the small-pox and died. She amassed a\nprivate fortune, castles, and estates such as no mistress had dreamed\nof; and into them she poured art treasures that cost the nation\nthirty-six millions of money. She created the porcelain factory of\nS\u00e8vres, kept keen watch over the Gobelins looms, and founded the great\nMilitary School of St. Cyr amidst work that would have kept several\nstatesmen busy, and of deadly intrigues at Court that would have\nbroken the spirit of many a brilliant man.\n\nIt was in her hectic desire to keep the king from being bored that she\nstooped, and made Boucher stoop, to the employment of his high\nartistry in the painting of a series of indecent pictures wherewith to\ntickle the jaded desires of Boredom, and thereby gave rise to the\nwidespread impression that Boucher's art was ever infected by base\ndesign. But Boucher was, at his very worst, but a healthy animal; and\neven in these secret works for the king he did not reach so low as did\nmany an artist of more pious memory who painted with no excuse but his\nown pleasure.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the Pompadour has been blamed too much for this\nevil act, and too much forgotten for her splendid patronage of the man\nwho, under it and during these great years of his forties, produced a\nseries of masterpieces that place him in the foremost rank of the\npainters of his century. It is impossible to reckon the number of the\npastorals and Venus-pieces that his master-hand painted and loved to\npaint, during these the supreme years of his genius. It is significant\nthat they were painted during the years that saw the Pompadour in\nsupreme power.\n\nBoucher was so firmly established in 1750, his forty-seventh year,\nthat he moved into a new house in the Rue Richelieu, near the Palais\nRoyal. Disappointed in not receiving a studio and apartments at the\nLouvre, he was allowed to use a studio in the king's library. He was\nnow making money so easily that he was able to collect pictures and\nprecious stones and the gaily coloured curiosities that appealed to\nhis tastes.\n\nThe critics were becoming more and more censorious; and one of them\nhits true with the comment that in his pastorals his shepherdesses\nlook as if they had stepped over from the Opera and would soon be off\nagain thereto.\n\nIn his forty-eighth year Boucher's art was at its most luminous\nstage--his atmosphere clear and subtle and exquisitely rendered; his\nyellows golden; his whites satin-like and silvery; his flesh-tones\nupon the nude bodies of his goddesses unsurpassed by previous art. The\nbeauty of it all was not to last much longer.\n\nLenormant de Tournehem died suddenly in the November of 1751; the\nPompadour's brother, Abel Poisson de Vandi\u00e8res, was appointed\nDirector-General in his stead at the age of twenty-five--and soon\nafterwards, on the death of his father, created Marquis de Marigny--a\nshy, handsome youth, a gentleman and an honourable fellow, whom the\nking liked well, and against whom his sister's sole complaint was that\nhe lacked the brazen effrontery of the courtiers of the day. No man\ndid more for the advancement of the art of his time. A pension of a\nthousand livres falling vacant, the young fellow secured it for\nBoucher; and almost immediately afterwards, a studio becoming vacant\nat the Louvre owing to the death of Coypel, first painter to the king,\nBoucher came to his coveted home, eagerly moving in with his family as\nsoon as its wretched state could be put into repair.\n\nThe decoration of the new wing to the palace at Fontainebleau brought\nthe commission for the painting of the ceiling and the principal\npicture in the Council Chamber to Boucher, who had already decorated\nthe Dining-Room. This was the period of his painting the \"Rising\" and\nthe \"Setting of the Sun\" for the Pompadour, now in the Watteau\ncollection, two canvases that were always favourites with the painter,\nbitterly as they were assailed by the critic Grimm.\n\nHe was turning out so much work that it was impossible to give as much\ncare to his pictures as he ought. For he refused sternly, his life\nlong, to raise his prices; by consequence he had to create a larger\namount of work in order to meet his expenditure. It was about this\ntime that Reynolds, passing through Paris, went to visit him and found\nhim painting on a huge canvas without models or sketches. \"On\nexpressing my surprise,\" writes Reynolds, \"he replied that he had\nconsidered the model as necessary during his youth until he had\ncompleted his study of art, but that he had not used one for a long\ntime past.\"\n\nHe soon had not the time, not only to paint from nature but even to\ngive his pictures the work necessary to complete them. The feverish\nhaste which took possession of him in his frantic endeavour to meet\nthe vast demand for his pictures, and the eager efforts of his\nengravers to satisfy the public call for engravings after his works,\ngave him less and less leisure to joy in their doing. And his eyesight\nbegan to fail. His flesh-tints deepened to a reddish hue; and he\nstands baffled before his work, suspecting his sight, since what every\none cries out upon as being bright vermilion, he only sees as a dull\nearthy colour. Boucher has topped the height of his achievement; he\nhas to \"descend the other side of the hill.\" Boucher begins to grow\nold.\n\nIn Boucher's fifty-first year an ugly intrigue of the queen's party at\nCourt to sap the Pompadour's influence over the king by drawing away\nthe king's affections towards Madame de Choiseul-Romanet, a reckless\nyoung beauty of the Court, brought about a strange alliance. The Count\nde Stainville, one of the Pompadour's bitterest enemies, was shown the\nking's letter of invitation to his young kinswoman; and he, deeply\nwounded in his pride that his kinswoman should have been offered to\nthe king, went to the Pompadour and exposed the plot. A close\nalliance followed; and De Stainville thenceforth became her chief\nguide in affairs of state. It was at her instance that the king called\nhim to be his Prime Minister, raising him to the Duchy of Choiseul--a\nname he made illustrious as one of the greatest Ministers of France.\n\nIn his fifty-second year Boucher was appointed to the directorship of\nthe Gobelins looms, to the huge delight of the weavers and all\nconcerned with the tapestry factory. This was the year of his painting\nthe famous portrait of the Pompadour, to whom he several times paid\nthis \"tribute of immorality.\" For the Gobelins looms he produced many\nhandsome designs; and he was painting with astounding industry. But\nhis hand's skill began to falter. His art shows weariness in his\nsixtieth year, and sickness fell upon him, and held him in servitude\nnow with rare moments of respite. The critics, notoriously Diderot,\nwere now attacking him with shameless virulence. Boucher passed it all\nby; but he felt the change that was taking place in the public taste.\n\nThe ideas of the New Philosophy were infecting public opinion; the Man\nof Feeling had arisen in the land; and France, humiliated in war, and\nresenting the follies and the greed of her shameless privileged class,\nwas openly resenting it and all its works. Choiseul had planted his\nstrength deep in the people's party, and was come near to being its\ngod. His masterly mind had checked Frederick of Prussia to the North;\nand the nations, exhausted by the struggle, signed the Peace of Paris\nin 1763. Choiseul, with France at peace abroad, turned to the blotting\nout of the turbulent order of the Jesuits at home. Their attempt to\nend the Pompadour's relations with the king made this powerful woman\neager to complete his design; the chance was soon to come, and the\nOrder was abolished from France and its vast property seized by the\nstate.\n\nThe Pompadour lived but a short while to enjoy her triumph. Worn out\nby her superhuman activities, assailed by debt, she fell ill of a\nracking cough, dying on the 15th of April, 1764, in her forty-second\nyear, keeping her ascendancy over the king and the supreme power in\nFrance to her last hour. Death found her transacting affairs of state.\n\nLouis, weary of his servitude, had only a heartless epigram to cast\nat the body of the dead woman as she passed to her last resting-place.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE END\n\n\nThe death of the Pompadour robbed Boucher of a friend; but her\nbrother, Marigny, remained faithfully attached to the old artist, and\nseized every chance to honour him. On the death of Carle van Loo,\nBoucher, at sixty-two, was made first painter to the king, with all\nhis pensions and privileges that were consistent with this the supreme\nappointment in the art world.\n\nThere had been serious intention of making Boucher the head of the\nEcole des El\u00e8ves Proteg\u00e9s; he had the art of making himself liked and\nof inspiring the love of the arts. He was very popular with the\nstudents and artists, owing to his kindliness, his eagerness to render\nservice, his readiness to encourage the youngsters or to console them.\n\nWhen the riot took place, provoked by the Academicians by their award\nof the Prix de Rome in 1767, the students insulted the Academicians,\nbut hailed Boucher with enthusiastic applause. The reason was not far\nto seek. When a student came to the old master for advice he did not\n\"play the pontiff,\" and, scorning the false dignity of big phrases, he\ntook the brush in his hand and showed the way out of all difficulties\nby simplehearted example, despising rules, and putting himself out in\norder to make things clear to a young artist.\n\nHowever, the Academicians feared he would be an unorthodox master for\nyouth, and appointed another in his place.\n\nA long and serious illness thwarted his keen energies. Diderot was\ngiving himself up to outrageous violence against him. If the old\npainter exhibited at the Salon, Diderot fiercely assailed his art; if\nhe did not exhibit, Diderot as bitterly assailed him for his\nnegligences. Above all, he attacked Boucher in that he did not paint\nwhat Diderot would have painted--but could not. \"When he paints\ninfants,\" cries Diderot, \"you will not find one employed in a real act\nof life--studying his lesson, reading, writing, stripping hemp.\"\n\nPoor unfortunate infants! for whom Philosophy could find no happier\njoy in life than stripping hemp! Boucher was but an artist. He\npainted his generation as far as he could see it, and, with all his\nfaults and weaknesses, he never debauched his art with foreign and\nalien things that had no part in the nation's life; he painted fair\nFrance into his landscapes, not a make-believe land he did not know\nwith preposterous Greek ruins; and best of all, to his eternal honour,\nhe painted infants glad in their gladness to be alive, with no desire\nto send their happy little bodies to school, with no sickly ambition\nto make them into budding philosophers, with no thought of making them\npose and lie as Men of Feeling. He had no joy in setting their little\nbodies to toil--in making them \"teach a lesson to the spectator,\" in\nmaking them stoop their little shoulders to the \"picking of hemp.\"\n\nHe continued to paint as he had always painted--except that he painted\nless well. The wreath of roses was wilting on a grey head. The blood\njigged less warmly in the frail body. The features showed pallid--the\neyes haggard. The sight failed. The hand alone kept something of its\ncunning.\n\nHe went to Holland with his friend Randon du Boisset, but health\nshrank farther from him. Diderot had near spent his last jibe.\n\nIn 1768, Boucher's sixty-fifth year, the neglected queen went to her\ngrave. The king's grief and contrition and vows to amend his life came\ntoo late, and lasted little longer than the drying of the floods of\ntears over the body of his dead consort. A year later he was become\nthe creature of a pretty woman of the gutters, whom he caused to be\nmarried to the Count du Barry--the infamously famous Madame du Barry.\n\nBut neither the remonstrances of Choiseul with the king against this\nfurther degradation of the throne of France, nor his unconcealed scorn\nof the upstart countess, nor the dangerous enemy he made for himself\nthereby, signified now to Boucher, first painter to the king.\n\nBoucher was failing. His son was a prig and a disappointment. His two\nfavourite pupils, Baudoin and Deshayes, who had married his two girls,\ndied.\n\nTo the Salon of 1769 he sent his \"Caravan of Bohemians.\" It was his\nlast display. He had been going about for some time like a gaunt ghost\nof his former self, afflicted with all the ills inevitable to a life\nfeverishly consumed in work and the pursuit of pleasure.\n\nThey went to his studio at five of the clock one May morning, and\nfound him seated at his easel, before a canvas of Venus, dead, with\nthe paint-filled brush fallen out of his fingers.\n\nSo passed he away on the 30th of May 1770, in his sixty-seventh year.\n\nWhen Boucher died, the generation of which he was the limner was near\ncome to its violent end. The rosy carnivals and gay gallantries of his\nage gave way to the blood-stained romance and fierce tempest of the\nRevolution. The garrets of the old curiosity-shops received the\ndiscarded canvases of the master. His shepherds and shepherdesses were\nput to rout by the Romans of his pupil, citizen David. The old order\nwas brought into contempt and overthrown. And with it, Boucher's art,\nlike much that was gracious and charming and good in the evil thing,\nwent down also, and was overwhelmed for a while.\n\nFor a while only. For just as, out of the blood and terror of the\nRevolution, a real France arose, phnix-wise, from the ruin, and in\nbeing born, whilst putting off the vilenesses of the thing from which\nshe sprang, took on also to herself the gracious and winsome qualities\nthat place her amongst the most fascinating peoples of the ages; so\nBoucher has come into his kingdom again--the most gracious of painters\nthat the years have yielded."

                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n        a. One bed, or folding cot,\n        b. One oil stove,\n        c. One lamp,\n        d. Enough supplies of all kinds sufficient for six months,\n        e. Pots, pans, kettles, etc.\nIt is needless to say that positions in Manila and Iloilo were now at\na premium.\n\nWas it possible that teachers were to be sent to places where even the\nnecessaries of life could not be obtained! Was it possible that many\nwould be sent to places so remote that for six months no fresh\nsupplies could be gotten! A mass meeting was held at once, and a\ncommittee was appointed to send a cablegram to the Associated Press\npetitioning aid from the American people at large. Realizing what\nconsternation would be created throughout the United States by such a\nmessage, two of the teachers leaped into a carriage at the close of\nthe meeting and a few moments later were closeted with the chief\nexecutive of the department. As a result the committee was persuaded\nnot to send the cablegram to the Associated Press until by courtesy it\nhad been sent to the President. Of course, this diplomatic move tided\naffairs over and the teachers who had flatly refused to budge from\nManila now agreed to go on to their stations, being assured that\nwhatever action was best would be taken.\n\nThe day had come when we must separate. We were to enter an untried\nand an unknown field. It was fitting that we have a final joyous\nmeeting, so the best orchestra in the archipelago was engaged and we\n\"chased the hours with flying feet\" until dawn so that whatever might\ncome to us in that unknown future upon which we were entering each\nwould hold in pleasant memory our last evening together.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER III. - A DRAMA IN ACTUAL LIFE.\n\n\nAlmost every one heeded the warning to go to his station forearmed\nwith at least necessaries of life, but, as it had never fallen to the\nlot of the writer to cook, he refused to learn at that late day, so he\ntook no pot, no pan, no kettle, putting his future into the hands of\nan uncertain fate and relying upon the unknown hospitality of the\nFilipino.\n\nBacalod, the capital of the province of Occidental Negros, was our\ndestination. The second morning after leaving Manila, we awoke with\nthe \"Kilpatrick\" lying at anchor in a shallow bay. We were several\nmiles from the shore and nothing in sight indicated that we had\nreached a place of any importance. Late the night before we had been\nawakened by the loud, sharp ringing of the ship's bells, accompanied\nby the reversal of the engines and a general disturbance awaking the\ncrew. So our first impressions on coming on deck were that we had run\naground. But the captain assured us that everything was ship-shape and\nthat this was the nearest point of approach to Capiz, a town of\nconsiderable importance on the island of Panay, where a body of troops\nwas to embark for home. Not even the grass hut of a native was in\nsight. Search as we would, not a sign was seen of a stream flowing\ninto the sea, indicating the probable presence of a town. There was\nnot a sign of life of any kind save one lone column of thin, blue\nsmoke that arose from the side of a mountain miles away. One would\nhave thought that we were explorers of three hundred years ago lying\noff the shore of some unknown land.\n\nAfter breakfast the steam launch, together with all the boats, was\nlowered, and several of us who had determined to miss no opportunity\nto gather information about the islands took our places in the launch\nby the side of the ship's mate, and steamed away across the water with\na long line of boats strung out in the rear. We headed away toward a\ngroup of cocoanut trees, and about an hour later stepped ashore on a\npile of decayed coral rocks that extended some twenty or thirty feet\nout into the water, thus forming the only landing place of a town of\nseveral thousands of people and of considerable commercial importance.\n\nA few moments after we had landed, an army wagon drawn by a\nmagnificent pair of mules came up out of a tropical jungle along a\nnarrow road. We clambered into the wagon and were soon lost in the\ndepths of foliage from which we had just seen the vehicle emerge.\n\nLong waving bamboos with their plumy leafage hung over the road from\neach side, meeting and overlapping in the center until they formed an\narchway so dense that the tropical sun now high in the heavens\npenetrated it only at intervals. At times the wagon sank up to the\nhubs in the soft earth, and the muscles of the mules stood out like\nwhip-cords under the skin as they drew us forward.\n\nAt a sharp turn in the road we came upon the first division of troops\nthat was to embark for home. The look of joy upon their sun-browned\nfaces was inexpressible. Their work was done, and with elastic step\nand smiling faces they saluted us as they passed by. The reign of\nforce was at an end; it was going out with them; the reign of peace\nhad begun; it was coming in with us.\n\nIn the afternoon when we returned from the town the last of the troops\nhad arrived and, as we drove up, the bugle was sounding the call to\nsupper. We noticed native women mingling with the troops and, indeed,\na native woman was in constant attention waiting upon one of the\nsoldiers with whom we ate. Her clothes were clean, her hair was nicely\ncombed, and her general appearance was neat. She seemed to anticipate\nthe slightest wish of the soldier with whom she was. She brought him\nwater to drink, cleaned his plate after the meal and saw that his\nknife, fork, and spoon were put into his haversack.\n\nWe had now finished supper and the launch had returned for the last\nload of troops. The lieutenant in command of the company gave the\norder to \"fall in\"; the men shouldered their rifles and fell into\nline. \"Forward, march!\" called the lieutenant, and the column swept\nforward towards the boats. The women had until now restrained\nthemselves, but, as their husbands marched away never to return, their\nfeelings could no longer be restrained. One young woman of about\neighteen, who was leaning against a rock by the roadside sobbing, when\nher husband passed, leaped up in frenzy of passionate love and caught\nthe rifle from his shoulder. Her first impulse seemed to be to throw\nthe gun away, but suddenly realizing the futility of such an act she\nburst into tears, shouldered the rifle herself and marched on by his\nside. Another woman of more mature age threw her arms around the legs\nof a tall stalwart man, and drew him bodily from the line.\n\nBut the troops marched on and entered the boats. One woman who had\nbeen unnoticed before came down into the shallow water and caught hold\nof our last boat as if to prevent its leaving, while others stood\nmingling their sobs with the sounds of the wavelets as they broke on\nthe sands. As we passed away, an expectant mother, standing in bold\noutline against the twilight sky, threw up her hands in an agony of\ndespair and then sank upon the stones. The curtain had fallen upon a\ndrama in actual life deeper in pathos than any other we had ever seen\nor ever expected to see. Depth of passion, depth of love! Who can\nfathom the human heart?\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. - WHAT THE TEACHERS DID.\n\n\nThere is a remarkable sameness about the towns in the Philippines.\n\nThey all have a large open square about the middle of the town, around\nthree sides of which are Chinese stores, unless one side lies open to\nthe sea, and on the fourth is the great stone ecclesia. The streets\nrun at right angles to one another and divide up the town into\ncreditable squares.\n\nEverybody in the Philippines lives up-stairs, for the ground is so\nsoaked with water during the rainy season that it is a menace to\nhealth to live upon the ground floor. So even the poorest nippa hut\nis built upon stakes four or five feet above the ground.\n\nBacalod is a typical Philippine town. As we landed, a broad open\nsquare was spread out before us. Two sides of the square were lined\nwith two-story houses in which were Chinese stores below and Filipino\nhomes above. On the third side stood the great stone church in whose\nmassive tower the clock was striking the hour of four, while the\nfourth lay open to the sea that had borne us thither.\n\nWe landed, but it was in a method new to us and one not usually\nemployed by the traveling public.\n\nWhen our sail boat ran aground on the sandy bottom a hundred yards or\nmore from the shore, a crowd of Filipino men who were on the beach\nslowly rolled up their pantaloons and waded out to the rescue,--for\nthe money that was in it. The boat's crew elevated their trousers'\nlegs also and slided down into the water. Each of us then straddled\nthe neck of a Filipino standing in the water and was held by ankles to\nbe steadied while our biped mounts proceeded to the shore.\n\nWe were now on the ground and face to face with the situation. To give\nthe reader an idea of the actual conditions met by the first teachers\nwho went to the Islands, the following is copied from the instructions\ngiven us in Manila:\n    1. There shall be two sessions daily of all schools, and the\n    last hour of the morning session shall be devoted solely to\n    instructing the Filipino teachers.\n\n    2. In cases where teachers are sent to a town in which there\n    is no school-house, they are expected to secure the aid of the\n    people and have one built.\n\n    3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is\n    stopped.\n\n    4. All supplies must be kept under lock and key. In towns\n    where there is no case or box to lock the supplies in, and it\n    is also impossible to get the town council to furnish a case,\n    a requisition may be sent to Manila, and, if an appropriation\n    can be secured, one will be made and sent out.\n\nThus it can be easily seen that we were indeed pioneers. In many\nplaces no school-house was to be found, and in some cases it was even\ndifficult to get the town council to provide a case in which to keep\nthe supplies.\n\nThe work of the teachers was, in short; to \"make the English language\nthe basis of instruction in the public schools.\" On our arrival at\nBacalod two schools were found in progress, for some soldiers had been\ndetailed for the work here previous to our coming. One of these was\nfor boys and the other, for girls. Thus the work here had been in a\nmeasure simplified, but complications that had arisen at Talisay, one\nof the largest and richest towns on the island, demanded a change of\nteachers and the writer was assigned to the place as superintendent.\n\nHere an attempt had been made to start a school but it had failed\nignominiously and a system of education was to be put into operation\nfrom the very start.\n\nThe Filipinos are not strong advocates of co-education, so separate\nschools were to be started for the boys and the girls. The one for the\nboys was gotten well in hand before the one for the girls was\nattempted at all.\n\nA few days after reaching the town and securing a home the\npresidente of the town had it publicly announced that the following\nMonday morning at eight o'clock a public school for boys would be\nopened in a building that had been rented for the purpose by the\nmunicipal council. About the middle of the afternoon of the same day a\nman beat a little drum throughout all the streets of the town to call\nthe people out and the town clerk announced both in Spanish and in the\nnative language that this public school would begin at the time and\nplace mentioned above; that instruction would be free to all who came;\nthat the government would furnish all supplies; and that instruction\nwould be given in the English language. A native principal and\nassistants were employed and everything was ready to begin.\n\nThe official report of the result is as follows:\n    Boys' public school of Talisay, Negros, P. I., began November\n    4, 1901. Forty-three boys present at eight o'clock. Forty-one\n    of them knew \"good morning\" and \"good afternoon\" but do not\n    know the distinction between them. Two of them speak simple\n    Spanish. At eight forty-five, eight more, who had been\n    attending an early morning private school, came in together.\n\n    The books they brought were so varied and so different from\n    one another that it seemed impossible to bring any reasonable\n    degree of order out of such a chaos, and so, after struggling\n    vainly for about a week with the problem, the superintendent\n    by one fell stroke removed everything in use and put in a\n    uniform system, and from that day on the English language has\n    been the basis of instruction in the public schools of\n    Talisay. The work was of necessity very slow at first, but by\n    the end of a year two schools were going nicely and a number\n    of the brightest boys and girls had made really excellent\n    progress.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER V. - A \"BAILE.\"\n\n\nNot long after the arrival of our party at Bacalod we received an\ninvitation to a \"baile\" given in our honor by the inhabitants of\nSilay, a town some ten or twelve miles up the northern coast and one\nnoted for its social life. The invitation was accepted with pleasure,\nand about the middle of the afternoon on the day appointed we were\nclad in the immaculate white of the tropics and steaming away up the\ncoast on board a launch sent for our conveyance. Twilight was still\nlingering on the path of day when we anchored just off shore at the\ntown. A row-boat containing the officials of the city came out to meet\nus and, in due season, we were ushered into a spacious drawing-room\nfilled almost to overflowing with the \u00e9lite of the town. The \u00e9lite of\ntowns in the Philippines speak Spanish, and, as only one or two of our\nparty could at that time boast of more than a formal acquaintance with\nthe Castilian tongue, the exchange of ideas that evening between us\nand the Filipinos was of necessity not very rapid.\n\nThe necessity of easy communication between us was rendered somewhat\nless indispensable by the announcement of supper as soon as we were\nrested from our trip. When we had taken our places at the table a\nyoung Filipino about twenty-five years of age arose and gave a lengthy\ntoast to the recent union of the Philippines with the United States.\n\nBut as we Americans were unable to scale the dizzy heights of his\nclimaxes or sink to the depths of his pathos, we forewent the\npleasures of his oratory and turned our attention to the savory odor\nof lamb, chicken, and roast pig that came slyly stealing up our\nnostrils to send us nerve dispatches about the gastronomic delights of\nour not far distant future.\n\nAt last the toast was ended and the world-wide soup ushered in a long\ntrain of things good to eat, served in a style better fitted to the\ndelights of the appetite than to the formalities of dinners, for, as\nsoon as the pleasant task of one dish was completed by any one, the\nnext was served him at once regardless of the progress made by the\nothers at the table.\n\nThe last course was dulce. The new-comers to the Philippines will\nnot be long in making the acquaintance of this dish, and at all\nmeetings, both public and private, where eatables are served, it\nperforms an important part. It is anything sweet, and it may vary all\nthe way from an india-rubber-like black mixture of cocoanut milk and\ndirty sugar to a really toothsome and respectable confection. No\nmatter of what materials a dish is composed, just so long as it is\nsweet, it is dulce.\n\nAfter paying our respects to this last course, we arose from the table\nand entered a great rectangular room from the center of whose ceiling\nhung a large glass chandelier, a mass of shimmering crystals. In the\nchairs around the room were the wealth, the youth, and the beauty of\nthe town.\n\nThe first and also the last number of every Filipino dance of any\nformality is the \"rigodon.\" The dancers are arranged in a square, or\nquadrangle according to the number participating, and are then led\nthrough a tangled maze of figures that so utterly bewilders the novice\nthat he sinks into his chair at the end of the dance wondering how it\nall came to pass.\n\nWe Americans breathed a sigh of relief when the \"rigodon\" ended, and\nmustered fresh courage for social conquests in the waltz that was now\nbreathing forth from the trembling strings. My companion in the first\ndance had been the young lady by whose side I had sat at dinner. But\nit now became necessary to search for another, so I prudently waited\nto see how partners were chosen, and made no mistake when a few\nmoments later I faced one of the most luscious looking se\u00f1oritas on\nthe opposite side of the room and offered her my arm. My eyes must\nhave told the story that my lips could not utter in Spanish, for she\nsmiled upon me sweetly, arose, and put her hand upon my shoulder. My\narm encircled her waist and I began to waltz. Unfortunately my\ncompanion did not follow, but began to hop up and down in a manner\nmost distressing. Supposing the attack to be only temporary, I paused\nand, much to my relief, she soon showed signs of recovery; and in the\ncourse of time she came to a standstill looking up into my face in an\ninquiring sort of way, apparently wondering why St. Vitus had not paid\nhis respects to me also. A second attempt to follow the music met with\nresults similar to the first, and during the third attempt, which\nseemed to be trembling on the verge of a failure, St. Vitus let go my\ncompanion and seized me with such vigor that she, who was small even\nfor a Filipino, was gathered up bodily and taken around the room at\nsuch a pace that her toes touched the floor only at far distant\nintervals.\n\nAt this point my devotion to the shrine of Terpsichore ceased from\nforce of circumstances and I seated myself in one of the most\ncomfortable chairs in sight that I might carry out a previously formed\nplan to study the Filipino somewhat critically as he appears in\nsociety.\n\nThe first thing that impressed me as the dancers passed up and down\nthe room was the flash of diamonds. Nearly every woman in the room had\non a brooch that flashed the colors of the rainbow at every turn.\n\nAlmost all of them wore one or more rings that showed up brilliantly\nunder the chandelier. Many of the men too, especially the young men,\nwore gems that appeared to be exquisite. A closer inspection showed\nthat some of the gems had flaws and others were of a poor color, but\nno one would have denied that, taken as a whole, it was a really\nbeautiful display.\n\nThe dress of the ladies was richly colored. Many of their skirts were\nof silk covered with hand embroidered flowers, and their filmy pina\nwaists and broad collar pieces were rich with needle-work. They all\nwore a kind of heelless velvet slipper, very common as a dress shoe in\nthe Philippines, or high-heeled patent leather shoes with neatly\nfitting black stockings.\n\nThe men were dressed in white coats and white pantaloons or black\ncoats and white pantaloons. White shirts and collars, together with\nall sorts and styles of cravats and low-cut patent leather shoes with\nhighly colored socks completed their dress.\n\nIt was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money;\nthat they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a\ntable loaded with good things was a fact to which all of us were\nenthusiastic witnesses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VI. - A SKETCH OF LIFE IN THE PHILIPPINES.\n\n\nHouse-keeping in the Philippines presents some interesting phases. Our\nclub of American officials decided to run a mess, so we employed a\ncook and a house boy, then each of us provided himself with a personal\nservant, making a total of six servants for four men--it takes about\nthis proportion of servants to live in any sort of comfort in the\nPhilippines--and launched ourselves boldly upon the sea of domestic\neconomy. But there were shoals ahead of us, for the question of\nregulating servants is one of no small importance in the Philippines,\nand one of its most disadvantageous features is the long chain of\ndependents that usually attends it.\n\nWe gave the cooks so much a day with which to buy supplies in the\nlocal market, for our own table, making him render a daily list of\nexpenditures, and a fixed amount besides to purchase rice and fish for\nhimself and the other servants. Of course, if they wished to vary\ntheir diet and get chicken and fresh pork, which could be had at far\ndistant intervals, it was wholly a matter of their option, but the\nallowance was made on the basis of so much rice and fish a day for\neach. This allowance was about fifteen cents a day in Spanish coin per\nservant.\n\nThus far all was well. We had agreed to give the cook eight dollars a\nmonth in Spanish money, thinking that good wages would procure good\nservice, but the visions of affluence that floated before him on such\nfloods of wealth were so alluring that they drew him from the kitchen\nto the cooler veranda. In less than a week he had employed an\nassistant at four dollars a month; in less than another week that\nassistant had employed him an assistant at two dollars a month; in\nless than another week that assistant to the assistant had employed\nhim an assistant at the princely salary of fifty cents a month; and\nfrom fear that the chain of dependents would end only by our having\nthe whole Filipino race attached to our culinary force, we broke up\nhouse-keeping and went boarding again, choosing that as the less of\nthe two evils.\n\nOur house furnishings were almost wholly Philippine. The table ware\nand the food on the table came from the ends of the earth. The knives\nand forks were made in Germany, the plates were manufactured in\nEngland, the glass ware and table cloth, in the United States. The\noatmeal and flour came from the United States also. The butter came\nfrom Australia, the rice from China, the salt from Russia, and the\nother eatables from sources about as various as their separate names.\n\nSwitzerland furnished the condensed milk and Illinois the canned\ncream. Nearly all of the canned fruit bore labels from Spain.\n\nThus it can easily be seen that life in the Philippines, if lived\naccording to American ideals, is dependent upon a highly developed and\nhighly complex commerce. However, the difficulties of transportation\nand the restriction of large stocks of merchandise to Manila and some\nhalf a dozen other towns, make so great a difference between country\nlife and city life that a short comparison of the two will not be out\nof place, and life in Manila may well be taken as being fairly typical\nof the latter.\n\nLife in Manila is pleasant, but expensive. It is pleasant from the\nfact that it is not only the capital but also metropolis of the\narchipelago. Thus the combination of wealth and high official position\nhas given to Manila a society of the highest and most refined type.\n\nThe process of beautifying and improving the city which is constantly\ngoing on bids fair to give us at no distant day a city of which we may\nwell be proud.\n\nBut let him who intends living well in Manila on a small income bid\nfarewell at once to so idylic a dream, for it costs much to live well\nthere. In the city of Manila one can get almost anything he wishes,\nbut it must be paid for at the price it commands. Especially in the\ncase of eatables, this price is by no means small, because to the\nfirst cost of articles must in most cases be added the expense of\ndistant shipment from American, European, or Australian ports, and not\ninfrequently the cost of long refrigeration must also be taken into\nconsideration. But, expensive though it is, it is very pleasant to\nlive there and those who have once enjoyed it often wish again to\nquaff the cup of its delights.\n\nIn strong contrast to this pleasant life is the life of the quiet\nlittle hamlet away in the distant islands. Indeed, the Filipino from\nthe distant town, who by some good fortune has been to Manila, or, by\na coup de main, has studied in one of the Manila colleges, is looked\nup to in a true hero-worshiping attitude by all who either know him or\nhear of his fame. Life in such a place is one long state of harmless\ninactivity. Not a wave of trouble from the great outer world ever\ndisturbs its peaceful repose. One lounges forever in an air of\nindolent ease and extreme aversion to anything approaching what might\nbe called a respectable effort.\n\nOne arises in the morning about the time the sun's first rays silver\nthe top leaves of the cocoanut trees and then stirs around until nine\nor ten o'clock, when it is found expedient to avoid a further exposure\nto the sun. From then until about five o'clock in the afternoon it is\nbest to take things as they come, even though one of those things be a\nFilipino dinner. But then you may have your vehiclo attached to a\nyoung bull with a ring in his nose and go for a drive. If it is the\ndry season you will probably enjoy the drive unless you object to the\nfrequent clouds of dust swept along by the evening wind. If it is in\nthe rainy season your pleasure will depend to a considerable extent\nupon how wet you get; but, whether the season be wet or dry, your\npleasure will be regulated largely by the state of harmony existing\nbetween the driver and the bull.\n\nIn these quiet secluded nooks successive generations of Filipinos are\nborn, reared, grow old and die in an even chain of events broken only\nby the occasional erection of a new grass house on the identical spot\nwhere its predecessors have stood for ages. The son lives in the house\nof his father, cultivates the same few square feet of soil planted in\nedible roots, climbs the same cocoanut trees, follows the same winding\npath down to the stream, pounds rice in the same mortar and with the\nsame stick that his ancestors have used from time unremembered, and,\nin case of illness, curls up on a grass mat in a corner of the room\nuntil he dies or by some good fortune recovers. Beyond this narrow\nhorizon he never looks. So narrow and contracted is the life that the\nlanguages of two towns a few miles apart are so different that one\nwould scarcely recognize them as belonging to the same race of people.\n\nSuch are the two extremes of life in our new far Eastern provinces:\nthe one is active, progressive, and cosmopolitan; the other, inactive,\ndecadent, and narrow; but, whether one enjoys the first or endures the\nsecond, there comes to him after leaving a longing to lounge again in\ntropic airs and listen to the lullaby of the winds among the palms.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VII. - THE FILIPINO AT HOME.\n\n\nAs one enters a Filipino sitting-room for the first time, there is one\nfeature in the arrangement of the furniture that impresses itself upon\nhim at once, and it may be stated without fear of serious\ncontradiction that this same peculiar feature in its arrangement will\ncontinue to face him, as he enters different homes, about as certainly\nas he crosses the threshold.\n\nThe arrangement referred to is that of one large mirror, one settee,\nand some ten or a dozen chairs that appear to have had a certain\norderly affection for one another. The mirror is hung upon one of the\nlarge interior parts of the house about four feet above the floor. The\nwooden houses in the Philippines are built by setting large posts\nupright into the ground, extending into the air from twenty to thirty\nfeet. Cross timbers are fastened to these upright posts about eight or\nten feet above the ground and then not sawed off even with the posts,\nbut allowed to extend beyond them each way. The framework of the house\nis built upon these extending cross timbers, a style of building by\nwhich these large upright posts are left standing out on the inside of\nthe room from one to three feet from the walls. It is on that one of\nthese posts most nearly opposite the door that the mirror always finds\nits place. Immediately beneath the mirror is the settee; and the\nchairs are arranged in two parallel lines facing one another and at\nright angles with the ends of the settee. However odd this arrangement\nmay appear to one when he first enters a Filipino drawing-room, there\nare two things to be said in its favor. In the first place, it places\nyou face to face with the person with whom you are conversing so that\nyou can watch him,--a matter of no small moment in the Philippines. In\nthe next place, it enables you to give one of the young ladies a\nsheep's-eye in the mirror while the others present are left where\nMoses was in our much abused conundrum.\n\nThe size of the residence and the quality of its furnishings depends\nupon the wealth of the owner. But there is so vast a difference\nbetween the mode of life of the highest class and the tao, or lowest\nclass, that it is well to speak of them separately, and the great\nmiddle class of Filipinos can easily be imagined to occupy the\nintervening ground.\n\nThe rich Filipino's house is usually of wood built upon a wall of\nstone or brick from ten to fifteen feet high. The floors are kept\nhighly polished in his hallway, dressing-room, and bed-rooms. There\nare, of course, no fire-places in any of the rooms, but on some\noccasions something is needed to dry the rain-soaked atmosphere, for\neven in the dry season it has been seen to rain for five successive\ndays and nights without the cessation of a moment.\n\nA long chain of dependents is attached to the household of the rich\nFilipino. The master has his special body servant to be present at all\ntimes to do his master's bidding, in short, to be the visible\nmechanism of his master's volition. So, too, the lady of the house has\nher servant woman to do the slightest bidding of her ladyship. Then\nthere is the cook who is almost invariably a man, a house boy or two,\nand the coachman. These functionaries, with their assistants and\nassistants to the assistants, together with a servant or two for the\nexclusive service of the children, complete the economic household.\n\nSuch a family has an abundance of rice and wheat bread, also of\nchicken and fish with occasional fresh beef. They have also a good\ndeal of dulce. They regularly serve wine and frequently serve beer\non their tables.\n\nIn strong contrast with this mode of life is that of the tao. His\ndiet consists almost wholly of rice and small uncleaned fish boiled\ntogether. As a rule knife, fork, plate, and spoon find no place in his\nhousehold. The rice and fish are boiled in a pot and then allowed to\ncool in the same vessel or poured out to cool in a large earthen or\nwooden bowl. Then Mr. Tao together with Mrs. Tao and all the young\nTaos squat on their heels around the mixture and satisfy that\nintangible thing called the appetite. They do not use chop sticks as\nthe Chinese do, but the rice and fish are caught in a hollow formed by\nthe first three fingers of the right hand. The thumb is then placed\nbehind the mass. It is raised up and poised before the mouth, with a\nskill coming from the evolution of ages, when a contraction of the\nmuscles of the thumb throws the mass into the mouth with a skill that\nis marvelous to any but a Filipino. To judge from the most reliable\ninformation, the poorest class do not have an abundance of food,\nalthough it would seem that such a condition of things would be\nwell-nigh impossible. However, in a census of one hundred school\nchildren there were found six boys and four girls who declared that\nthey had never had enough to eat, and the native teacher stated that\nthis was probably true.\n\nThe wide gulf between the tao and the rich man is filled by the\ngreat middle class of Filipinos.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VIII. - VISIT TO A LEPER COLONY.\n\n\nNot far from our town was a leper colony and the first Saturday that\ncould be spared was set aside for a trip to the place. It happened\nthat none of the other Americans were at leisure on this particular\nmorning, but, rather then delay the trip or miss it altogether, the\nwriter, armed with a revolver, started out alone.\n\nThe road had been described so accurately by one who was supposed to\nknow it that it was deemed well-nigh impossible to miss the way. The\nmain highway was followed to the point where the by-path supposed to\nlead to the settlement turned off through some bamboo thickets and a\nlow tropical wood. This path led straight away towards the sea-coast\nwhere the houses of the colony were said to stand in a cocoanut grove\nby the beach.\n\nUpon arriving at the settlement, a very inhospitable reception was\nreceived from a mangy cur that growled and showed a very uninviting\nset of sharp, white teeth behind his snarling lips. The growling of\nthe dog had attracted the attention of an old man who, with age-bent\nback, was pounding rice in a mortar about fifty yards away. He turned\nslowly around and, upon seeing an intruder into the primitive quiet of\nthe place, gave a sharp, far-reaching call. The sound had scarcely\nrung through the grove when from about a dozen of the little grass\nhouses dotted here and there fifteen or twenty men armed with bolos\ncame out and gathered around the old man. A sense of my danger flashed\nupon me. Three miles from town and alone in a tropical jungle, I could\nbe almost instantly overcome by this band of bolo-men, and the only\nreport that would ever reach my people would be that I had\n\"disappeared.\" Of course, attack was by no means certain, but the\npotentiality of the situation was thrilling. A drawn revolver and the\ngleaming of its shining barrel had the effect of stopping the men, who\nseemed to be hesitating as to a course of action, until a somewhat\ndignified retreat was made to an open space in the rear from where a\nless dignified and a more hasty retreat began which did not stop short\nof Bacalod.\n\nEnough had been seen, however, even in this short visit, to give\nconvincing proof that the settlement visited was no colony of lepers;\nso, that afternoon two servant boys being taken as guides and\ninterpreters, another attempt was made to reach the goal desired.\n\nThis attempt was successful, and, after about two hours of walking, a\nlittle cluster of grass huts snugly hidden by the sea-coast came into\nview. As we approached, one would have thought it a gala-day. Some few\nchildren, apparently from six to thirteen years of age, almost wholly\nnude, were romping and playing in the open space around which the huts\nstood, and no one would ever have thought that any cloud so horrible\nas leprosy could hover over a place apparently so happy.\n\nBy the side of the path as we passed was a man and his wife setting\nout potato plants. His hands were so puffed and his fingers so short\nthat he could scarcely use them, but he was working along as best he\ncould. His wife's feet were so swollen and twisted that she walked\nonly with the greatest difficulty. We passed them by and entered the\nopen space above referred to.\n\nThe children now saw us, and those of them who could darted away like\nfrightened rabbits, each to his own burrow. An old man who was sitting\nin the warm afternoon sun on the little bamboo platform before his hut\nwas aroused from his lethargic repose by the scampering away of the\nchildren. He arose, trembling upon his tottering limbs, all drawn and\ntwisted, and hobbled away into his hut.\n\nThe children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at\nthe doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of\nthe settlement. In a few moments we were surrounded by a circle of\nhuman beings at once so repulsive and so pitiable that its graphic\nvividness can never be accurately portrayed.\n\nThe old man referred to above, having put on a pair of snow-white\npantaloons, appeared now at the doorway of his hut, followed a few\nmoments later by his wife who had evidently clothed herself in the\nbest raiment she had. At a call from the old man, all the men, women,\nand children in the settlement came out of their huts and stood in a\nline before us. The old man was spokesman and in his native visayan\ntongue made a heart-rending appeal for aid which we were powerless to\ngive. Attention was called to a leper woman, apparently about\ntwenty-five years of age, whose face had been attacked by the disease\nand whose appearance was truly pathetic. Upon her hip was a child\nabout a year and a half old and, strange to say, the child showed as\nyet no signs whatever of the disease.\n\nWhat an indissoluble enigma is life! Here in a little cluster of grass\nhuts in a secluded nook of a secluded island of an all but secluded\narchipelago was gathered together a little community of wretched\nnatives, driven by their loathsomeness from association with others\neven of the same half-savage race. Yet here, men and women loved and\nwere married, by mutual trust if not by law, and children were born of\nthe union to live forever under the unspeakable horror that\novershadowed the unfortunate parents. Love, hatred, sorrow, and\njoy--every passion that enters into the complex structure of the human\nheart even here, in this scene of sadness and despair, was playing\napparently as freely as where misfortune and disease had never crossed\nthe portals of life.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER IX. - A \"HIKE.\"\n\n\nWe were lounging lazily in our hammocks at Jimamaylan one evening in\nApril. Supper was just ended, and the soldiers in the post were\ncollected in groups here and there spinning yarns to pass away the\ntime, when a Filipino clad only in a loin cloth came down the street\nat a steadily swinging run and stopped in front of the sentry. He\nbrought the announcement that a band of ladrones had just burned a\nsugar mill and were advancing to sack a barrio about fifteen miles\naway.\n\nThe invitation of the commanding officer to go on a \"hike\" was eagerly\naccepted, and, in ten minutes after the message was given, the troops\nwere on the march followed by two adventurous pedagogues.\n\nDarkness was just closing in as we left the town, but a resplendent\ntropic moon soon made the night almost as brilliant as the day. The\ntrail we followed led over rough and rocky country. Sometimes for a\ndistance of a mile or more we passed over barren wastes of volcanic\nslag poured out in anger by some peak whose convulsions have long\nsince ceased. Again we would descend into a tropical jungle from the\ndense foliage of which the ladrones could have leaped at any moment,\nhad they known of our coming, and annihilated our little band. We\nforded rapid streams with the water at our breasts, and halted only\nonce in that rapid march of fifteen miles.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the town we met a man who was standing\nguard against a surprise by the ladrones. Nothing could well have been\nmuch more grotesque and nothing could much better illustrate the\nabsolutely primitive condition of the Filipinos in the interior of the\nislands than the appearance of this guard. A pair of knee pants, a\nconical grass hat, and a hemp shirt formed his entire apparel. A long\nflat wooden shield, a bolo, and a long bamboo spear with a sharp,\nflat, iron point, completed his equipment for battle.\n\nHere stood the first and the twentieth centuries side by side. The\nFilipino who had advanced only a stage beyond the condition of\nprimitive man with his knife, spear, and wooden shield, stood side by\nside with the American soldier, a representative of modern life with\nhis magazine rifle, his canteen, his knapsack,--with every article of\nhis clothing made to give him the highest possible efficiency as the\nunit of a military organization.\n\nA few yards farther on we met another guard equipped similarly to the\nfirst. Upon reaching the town, news had just been received that a\ndetachment of troops from another post had intercepted the ladrones\nand fought a skirmish with them. The ladrones had escaped and we set\nout in pursuit of them on a chase wilder than a Quixotic dream. We\nwound our way into the mountains behind the town, inquiring at every\ngrass hut we passed whether the band of ladrones had passed that way,\nbut only once was even a trace of them found. Then it was learned that\nat a certain place they had separated into groups of three or four and\ngone glimmering through the dream of things that were. This place was\nin a secluded nook of the mountains where in years gone by some\nadventurous Spaniard had erected a primitive water mill to grind his\nsugar-cane. We had now marched about twenty miles and the feet of the\npedagogues were a mass of blisters. They had reached the point where\nthat form of military maneuvering called \"hiking\" ceased to possess\nany alluring charms. So a native was persuaded to come out of his lone\nmountain hut and hitch up his carabao and cart. He was then made to\nget on the carabao's back, while the aforesaid pedagogues lay down on\nthe sugar-cane pulp that had been put into the body of the cart, and\nthe driver was instructed to start for the post we had left hours\nbefore, and not to stop until he got there. Being uncertain but that\nsome of the ladrones would learn of our having left the body of troops\nand would try the metal of our steel, we at first agreed that neither\nof us should go to sleep, but it was later decided that probably the\ndriver had no greater desire to cross the Styx than his passengers had\nand that in case of danger he would awaken us, so both took a revolver\nin each hand, stretched out supinely and went to sleep.\n\nSuch a sleep! The rough jolting of the cart over an almost impassable\nroad was never enough to break the spell of slumber. When we awoke the\nblazing tropic sun was past the midday mark of morning, shining full\ninto our unprotected and well-nigh blistered faces.\n\nA pack of dogs were heralding our approach to a little village at the\nfoot of the mountains where ponies were procured to take us back to\nthe post.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he insists, \"have stood the test of ages; and the plant\nevery where retained its name and credit: and one of our good\nherbarists, who had seen a wonderful case of a swoln spleen, so big, and\nhard as to be felt with terror, brought back to a state of nature by it\"\n\n(p. 37). The greatest portion of Hill's concluding section combines\nadvertisement for the powder medicine he was himself manufacturing at a\nhandsome profit together with a protest against competing apothecaries:\n\"An intelligent person was directed to go to the medicinal herb shops in\nthe several markets, and buy some of this Spleen-wort; the name was\nwritten, and shewn to every one; every shop received his money, and\nalmost every one sold a different plant, under the name of this: but\nwhat is very striking, not one of them the right\" (p. 42).\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis did not cease to be printed after Hill's in\n1766, but continued to issue from the presses into the nineteenth\ncentury. A good example of this is the tome by John Reid, physician to\nthe Finsbury Dispensary in London, Essays on Insanity, Hypochondriasis\nand Other Nervous Affections (1816), which summarizes theories of the\nmalady. A bibliographical study of such works would probably reveal\na larger number of titles in the nineteenth century than in the previous\none, but by this time the nature and definition of hypochondria had\nchanged significantly.\n\nIf John Hill's volume is not an important contribution in the history of\nmedicine, it is a lucid and brief exposition of many of the best ideas\nthat had been thought and written on the hyp, with the exception of his\nuninhibited prescribing of herbal medicines as cure-alls. An\nunderstanding of this disease is essential for readers of neoclassical\nEnglish literature, especially when we reflect upon the fact that some\nof the best literature of the period was composed by writers whom it\nafflicted. It is perhaps not without significance that the greatest poet\nof the Augustan age, Alexander Pope, thought it necessary as he lay on\nhis deathbed in May 1744 to exclaim with his last breath, \"I never was\nhippish in my whole life.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. I. - The NATURE of the DISORDER.\n\n\nTo call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and cruel. It\nis a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by thickened\nand distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver, and other\nparts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick scarce knows\none more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\n\nThe blood is a mixture of many fluids, which, in a state of health, are\nso combined, that the whole passes freely through its appointed vessels;\nbut if by the loss of the thinner parts, the rest becomes too gross to\nbe thus carried through, it will stop where the circulation has least\npower; and having thus stopped it will accumulate; heaping by degrees\nobstruction on obstruction.\n\nHealth and chearfulness, and the quiet exercise of mind, depend upon a\nperfect circulation: is it a wonder then, when this becomes impeded the\nbody looses of its health, and the temper of its sprightliness? to be\notherwise would be the miracle; and he inhumanly insults the afflicted,\nwho calls all this a voluntary frowardness. Its slightest state brings\nwith it sickness, anguish and oppression; and innumerable ills follow\nits advancing steps, unless prevented by timely care; till life itself\ngrows burthensome.\n\nThe disease was common in antient Greece; and her physicians understood\nit, better than those perhaps of later times, in any other country; who\nthough happy in many advantages these fathers of the science could not\nhave, yet want the great assistance of frequent watching it in all its\nstages.\n\nThose venerable writers have delivered its nature, and its cure: in the\nfirst every thing now shews they were right; and what they have said as\nto the latter will be found equally true and certain. This, so far as\npresent experience has confirmed it, and no farther, will be here laid\nbefore the afflicted in a few plain words.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. II. - Persons Subject to it.\n\n\nFatigue of mind, and great exertion of its powers often give birth to\nthis disease; and always tend to encrease it. The finer spirits are\nwasted by the labour of the brain: the Philosopher rises from his study\nmore exhausted than the Peasant leaves his drudgery; without the benefit\nthat he has from exercise. Greatness of mind, and steady virtue;\ndetermined resolution, and manly firmness, when put in action, and\nintent upon their object, all also lead to it: perhaps whatever tends to\nthe ennobling of the soul has equal share in bringing on this weakness\nof the body.\n\nFrom this we may learn easily who are the men most subject to it; the\ngrave and studious, those of a sedate temper and enlarged understanding,\nthe learned and wise, the virtuous and the valiant: those whom it were\nthe interest of the world to wish were free from this and every other\nillness; and who perhaps, except for this alloy, would have too large a\nportion of human happiness.\n\nThough these are most, it is not these alone, who are subject to it.\n\nThere are countries where it is endemial, and in other places some have\nthe seeds of it in their constitution; and in some it takes rise from\naccidents. In these last it is the easiest of cure; and in the first\nmost difficult.\n\nBeside the Greeks already named, the Jews of old time were heavily\nafflicted with this disease; and in their descendants to this day it is\noften constitutional: the Spaniards have it almost to a man; and so have\nthe American Indians. Perhaps the character of these several nations may\nbe connected with it. The steady honour, and firm valour of the\nSpaniard, very like that of the ancient Doric nation, who followed the\nflute not the trumpet to the field; and met the enemy, not with shouts\nand fury, but with a determined virtue: it is the temper of the\nHypochondriac to be slow, but unmoveably resolved: the Jew has shewn\nthis mistakenly, but almost miraculously; and the poor Indian, untaught\nas he is, faces all peril with composure, and sings his death-song with\nan unalter'd countenance.\n\nAmong particular persons the most inquiring and contemplative are those\nwho suffer oftenest by this disease; and of all degrees of men I think\nthe clergy. I do not mean the hunting, shooting, drinking clergy, who\nbear the tables of the great; but the retir'd and conscientious; such as\nattend in midnight silence to their duty; and seek in their own cool\nbreasts, or wheresoever else they may be found, new admonitions for an\nage plunged in new vices. To this disease we owe the irreparable loss of\nDr. YOUNG; and the present danger of many other the best and most\nimproved amongst us. May what is here to be proposed assist in their\npreservation!\n\nThe Geometrician or the learned Philosopher of whatever denomination,\nwhose course of study fixes his eye for ever on one object, his mind\nintensely and continually employed upon one thought, should be warned\nalso that he is in danger; or if he find himself already afflicted, he\nshould be told that the same course of life, which brought it on, will,\nwithout due care, encrease it to the most dreaded violence.\n\nThe middle period of life is that in which there is the greatest danger\nof an attack from this disease; and the latter end of autumn, when the\nsummer heats have a little time been over, is the season when in our\nclimate its first assaults are most to be expected. The same time of the\nyear always increases the disorder in those who have been before\nafflicted with it; and it is a truth must be confessed, that from its\nfirst attack the patient grows continually, though slowly, worse; unless\na careful regimen prevent it.\n\nThe constitutions most liable to this obstruction are the lean, and dark\ncomplexioned; the grave and sedentary. Let such watch the first\nsymptoms; and obviate, (as they may with ease) that which it will be\nmuch more difficult to remove.\n\nIt is happy a disease, wherein the patient must do a great deal for\nhimself, falls, for the most part, upon those who have the powers of\nreason strongest. Let them only be aware of this, that the distemper\nnaturally disposes them to inactivity; and reason will have no use\nunless accompanied with resolution to enforce it.\n\nThough the physician can do something toward the cure, much more depends\nupon the patient; and here his constancy of mind will be employed most\nhappily. No one is better qualified to judge on a fair hearing what\ncourse is the most fit; and having made that choice, he must with\npatience wait its good effects. Diseases that come on slowly must have\ntime for curing; an attention to the first appearances of the disorder\nwill be always happiest; because when least established it is easiest\noverthrown: but when that happy period has been neglected, he must wait\nthe effects of such a course as will dilute and melt the obstructing\nmatter gradually; for till that be done it is not only vain, but\nsometimes dangerous, to attempt its expulsion from the body.\n\nThe blood easily separates itself into the grosser and the thinner\nparts: we see this in bleeding; and from the toughness of the red cake\nmay guess how very difficult it will be to dissolve a substance of like\nfirmness in the vessels of the body. That it can thus become thickened\nwithin the body, a Pleurisy shews us too evidently: in that case it is\nbrought on suddenly, and with inflammation; in this other, slowly and\nwithout; and here, even before it forms the obstruction, can bring on\nmany mischiefs. Various causes can produce the same effect, but that in\nall cases operates most durably, which operates most slowly. The watery\npart of the blood is its mild part; in the remaining gross matter of it,\nare acrid salts and burning oils, and these, when destitute of that\nhappy dilution nature gives them in a healthy body, are capable of doing\ngreat mischief to the tender vessels in which they are kept stagnant.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. III. - The SYMPTOMS of the DISORDER.\n\n\nThe first and lightest of the signs that shew this illness are a lowness\nof spirits, and inaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love\nof solitude and a habit of thinking, even on trifling subjects, with too\nmuch steadiness. A very little help may combat these: but if that\nindolence which is indeed a part of the disorder, will neglect them;\nworse must be expected soon to follow.\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness, weight, and oppression in the body,\na want of appetite, or, what is worse, an appetite without digestion;\nfor these are the conditions of different states of the disease, a\nfullness and a difficulty of breathing after meals, a straitness of the\nbreast, pains and flatulencies in the bowels, and an unaptness to\ndischarge their contents.\n\nThe pulse becomes low, weak, and unequal; and there are frequent\npalpitations of the heart, a little dark-coloured urine is voided at\nsome times; and a flood of colourless and insipid at others; relieving\nfor a moment, but increasing the distemper: there is in some cases also\na continual teazing cough, with a choaking stoppage in the throat at\ntimes; then heartburn, sickness, hardness of the belly, and a costive\nhabit, or a tormenting and vain irritation.\n\nThe lips turn pale, the eyes loose their brightness and by degrees the\nwhite grows as it were greenish, the gums want their due firmness, with\ntheir proper colour; and an unpleasing foulness grows upon the teeth:\nthe inside of the mouth is pale and furred, and the throat dry and\nhusky: the colour of the skin is pale (though there are periods when the\nface is florid) and as the obstruction gathers ground, and more affects\nthe liver, the whole body becomes yellow, tawny, greenish, and at length\nof that deep and dusky hue, to which men of swift imagination have given\nthe name of blackness.\n\nThese symptoms do not all appear in any one period of the disease, or in\none case, but at one time or other all of them, as well as those which\nfollow: the flesh becomes cold to the touch, though the patient does not\nhimself perceive it; the limbs grow numbed and torpid, the breathing\ndull and slow, and the voice hollow; and usually the appetite in this\nperiod declines, and comes almost to nothing: night sweats come on,\nblack swellings appear on the veins, the flesh wastes and the breast\nbecomes flat and hollow: the mouth is full of a thin spittle, the head\nis dizzy and confus'd, and sometimes there is an unconquerable numbness\nin the organs of speech.\n\nI have known the temporary silence that follows upon this last symptom\nbecome a jest to the common herd; and the unhappy patient, instead of\ncompassion and assistance, receive the reproof of sullenness, from those\nwho should have known and acted better.\n\nAbout twenty years ago I met on a visit at Catthorpe in Leicestershire a\nyoung gentleman of distinguished learning and abilities, who at certain\ntimes was speechless. The vulgar thought it a pretence: and a jocose\nlady, where he was at tea with company, putting him as she said to a\ntrial, poured out a dish very strong and without sugar. He drank it and\nreturned the cup with a bow of great reserve, and his eye bent on the\nground: she then filled the cup with sugar, and pouring weak tea on it,\nsent it him: he drank that too, looked at her steadily, and blushed for\nher. The lady declared the man was dumb; the rest thought him perverse,\nand obstinate; but a constant and steady perseverance in an easy method\ncured him.\n\nAll these are miseries which the disease, while it retains its natural\nform, can bring upon the patient; and thus he will in time be worn out,\nand led miserably, though slowly, to the grave. Let him not indulge his\ninactivity so far as to give way to this, because it is represented as\nfar off; the disease may suddenly and frightfully change its nature; and\nswifter evils follow.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. IV. - The DANGER.\n\n\nWe have done with the obstruction considered in itself; but this, though\noften unsurmountable by art, at least by the methods now in use, will be\nsometimes broken through at once by nature, or by accidents; and bring\non fatal evils. These are strictly different diseases, and are no\notherway concerned here, than as the consequences of that of which we\nare treating.\n\nThe thick and glutinous blood which has so long stagnated in the spleen,\nwill have in that time altered its nature, and acquired a very great\ndegree of acrimony: while it lies dormant, this does no more mischiefs,\nthan those named already; but when violent exercise, a fit of outrageous\nanger, or any thing else that suddenly shocks and disturbs the frame,\nputs it in motion, it melts at once into a kind of liquid putrefaction.\n\nBeing now thin, it mixes itself readily with the blood again, and brings\non putrid fevers; destroys the substance of the spleen itself, or being\nthrown upon some other of the viscera, corrodes them, and leads on this\nway a swift and miserable death. If it fall upon the liver, its tender\npulpy substance is soon destroyed, jaundices beyond the help of art\nfirst follow, then dropsies and all their train of misery; if on lungs,\nconsumptions; if on the brain, convulsions, epilepsy, palsy, apoplexy;\nif on the surface, leprosy.\n\nThe intention of cure is to melt this coagulation softly, not to break\nit violently; and then to give it a very gentle passage through the\nbowels. There is no safe way for it to take but that; and even that when\nurged too far may bring on fatal dysenteries.\n\nLet none wonder at the sudden devastation which sometimes arises from\nthis long stagnant matter, when liquified too hastily: how long, how\nmany years the impacted matter will continue quiet in a schirrous tumour\nof the breast; but being once put in motion, whether from accident, or\nin the course of nature, what can describe; or what can stop its\nhavock!\n\nInstances of the other are too frequent. A nobleman the other day died\nparalytick: dissection shewed a spleen consumed by an abscess, formed\nfrom the dissolved matter of such an obstruction: and 'tis scarce longer\nsince, a learned gentleman, who had been several years lost to his\nfriends, by the extreams of a Hypochondriacal disorder, seem'd gradually\nwithout assistance to recover: but the lungs suffered while the spleen\nwas freed; and he died very soon of what is called a galloping\nconsumption.\n\nWhen the obstruction is great and of long continuance, if it be thus\nhastily moved, the consequence is, equally, a sudden and a miserable\ndeath, whether, like the matter of a cancer, it remains in its place; or\nlike that of a bad small pox, be thrown upon some other vital part.\n\nLet not the patient be too much alarmed; this is laid down to caution,\nnot to terrify him: it is fit he should know his danger, and attend to\nit; for the prevention is easy; and the cure, even of the most advanced\nstages, when undertaken by gentle means, is not at all impracticable: to\nassist the physician, let him look into himself, and recollect the\nsource of his complaint. This he may judge of from the following\nnotices.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. V. - The Causes of the HYPOCHONDRIASIS.\n\n\nThe obstruction which forms this disease, may take its origin from\ndifferent accidents: a fever ill cured has often caused it; or the\npiles, which had been used to discharge largely, ceasing; a marshy soil,\npoisoned with stagnant water, has given it to some persons; and altho'\nindolence and inactivity are oftenest at the root, yet it has arisen\nfrom too great exercise.\n\nReal grief has often brought it on; and even love, for sometimes that is\nreal. Study and fixed attention of the mind have been accused before;\nand add to these the stooping posture of the body, which most men use,\nthough none should use it, in writing and in reading. This has\ncontributed too much to it; but of all other things night studies are\nthe most destructive. The steady stillness, and dusky habit of all\nnature in those hours, enforce, encourage, and support that settled\ngloom, which rises from fixt thought; and sinks the body to the grave;\neven while it carries up the mind to heaven. He who would have his lamp\n        At midnight hour\n  Be seen in some high lonely tower,\nwill waste the flame of this unheeded life: and while he labours to\nunsphere the spirit of Plato will let loose his own.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VI. - The Cure of the HYPOCHONDRIASIS.\n\n\nLet him who would escape the mischiefs of an obstructed spleen, avoid\nthe things here named: and let him who suffers from the malady,\nendeavour to remember to which of them it has been owing; for half the\nhope depends upon that knowledge.\n\nNature has sometimes made a cure herself, and we should watch her ways;\nfor art never is so right as when it imitates her: sometimes the\npatient's own resolution has set him free. This is always in his power,\nand at all times will do wonders.\n\nThe bleeding of the piles, from nature's single efforts, has at once\ncured a miserable man; where their cessation was the cause of the\ndisorder. A leprosy has appeared upon the skin, and all the symptoms of\nthe former sickness vanished. This among the Jews happened often: both\ndiseases we know were common among them: and I have here seen something\nvery like it: Water-Dock has thrown out scorbutic eruptions, and all the\nformer symptoms of an Hypochondriacal disorder have disappeared:\nreturning indeed when these were unadvisedly struck in; but keeping off\nentirely when they were better treated. A natural purging unsuppressed\nhas sometimes done the same good office: but this is hazardous.\n\nIt is easy to be directed from such instances; only let us take the\nwhole along with us. Bleeding would have answered nature's purpose, if\nshe could not have opened of herself the h\u00e6morrhoidal vessels; but he\nwho should give medicines for that purpose, might destroy his patient by\ntoo great disturbance. If a natural looseness may perform the cure, so\nmay an artificial; when the original source of the disorder points that\nway. But these are helps that take place only in particular cases.\n\nThe general and universal method of cure must be by some mild and gently\nresolving medicine, under the influence of which the obstructing matter\nmay be voided that, or some other way with safety. The best season to\nundertake this is the autumn, but even here there must be caution.\n\nIn the first place, no strong evacuating remedy must be given; for that,\nby carrying off the thinner parts of the juices, will tend to thicken\nthe remainder; and certainly encrease the distemper. No acrid medicine\nmust be directed, for that may act too hastily, dissolve the impacted\nmatter at once, and let it loose, to the destruction of the sufferer; no\nantimonial, no mercurial, no martial preparation must be taken; in\nshort, no chymistry: nature is the shop that heaven has set before us,\nand we must seek our medicine there. The venerable ancients, who knew\nnot this new art, will lead us in the search; and (faithful relators as\nthey are of truth) will tell us whence we may deduce our hope; and what\nwe are to fear.\n\nBut prior to the course of any medicine, and as an essential to any good\nhope from it, the patient must prescribe himself a proper course of\nlife, and a well chosen diet: let us assist him in his choice; and speak\nof this first, as it comes first in order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VI. - Rules of Life for Hypochondriac Persons.\n\n\nAir and exercise, as they are the best preservers of health, and\ngreatest assistants in the cure of all long continued diseases, will\nhave their full effect in this; but there requires some caution in the\nchoice, and management of them. It is common to think the air of high\ngrounds best; but experience near home shews otherwise: the\nHypochondriac patient is always worse at Highgate even than in London.\n\nThe air he breathes should be temperate; not exposed to the utmost\nviolences of heat and cold, and the swift changes from one to the\nother; which are most felt on those high grounds. The side of a hill is\nthe best place for him: and though wet grounds are hurtful; yet let\nthere be the shade of trees, to tempt him often to a walk; and soften by\ntheir exhalation the over dryness of the air.\n\nThe exercise he takes should be frequent; but not violent. Motion\npreserves the firmness of the parts, and elasticity of the vessels; it\nprevents that aggregation of thick humours which he is most to fear. A\nsedentary life always produces weakness, and that mischief always\nfollows: weak eyes are gummy, weak lungs are clogged with phlegm, and\nweak bowels waste themselves in vapid diarrhoeas.\n\nLet him invite himself abroad, and let his friends invite him by every\ninnocent inducement. For me, I should advise above all other things the\nstudy of nature. Let him begin with plants: he will here find a\ncontinual pleasure, and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful\nthings; even of the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to\nwalk; and every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket,\nwill afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually\nin the air, and continually to change the nature and quality of the air,\nby visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the lawn, the\nheath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be abroad; and the\nunceasing variety of the subjects of his observation, will prevent his\nwalking hastily: he will pursue his studies in the air; and that\ncontemplative turn of mind, which in his closet threatened his\ndestruction, will thus become the great means of his recovery.\n\nIf the mind tire upon this, from the repeated use, another of nature's\nkingdoms opens itself at once upon him; the plant he is weary of\nobserving, feeds some insect he may examine; nor is there a stone that\nlies before his foot, but may afford instruction and amusement.\n\nEven what the vulgar call the most abject things will shew a wonderful\nutility; and lead the mind, in pious contemplation higher than the\nstars. The poorest moss that is trampled under foot, has its important\nuses: is it at the bottom of a wood we find it? why there it shelters\nthe fallen seeds; hides them from birds, and covers them from frost;\nand thus becomes the foster father of another forest! creeps it along\nthe surface of a rock? even there its good is infinite! its small roots\nrun into the stone, and the rains make their way after them; the moss\nhaving lived its time dies; it rots and with the mouldered fragments of\nthe stone forms earth; wherein, after a few successions, useful plants\nmay grow, and feed more useful cattle!\n\nIs there a weed more humble in its aspect, more trampled on, or more\ndespised than knot grass! no art can get the better of its growth, no\nlabour can destroy it; 'twere pity if they could, for the thing lives\nwhere nothing would of use to us; and its large and most wonderfully\nabundant seeds, feed in hard winters, half the birds of Heaven.\n\nWhat the weak moss performs upon the rock the loathed toadstool brings\nabout in timber: is an oak dead where man's eye will not find it? this\nfungus roots itself upon the bark, and rots the wood beneath it; hither\nthe beetle creeps for shelter, and for sustenance; him the woodpecker\nfollows as his prey; and while he tears the tree in search of him, he\nscatters it about the ground; which it manures.\n\nNor is it the beetle alone that thus insinuates itself into the\nsubstance of the vegetable tribe: the tender aphide, whom a touch\ndestroys, burrows between the two skins of a leaf, for shelter from his\nwinged enemies; tracing, with more than Dedal\u00e6an art, his various\nmeanders; and veining the green surface with these white lines more\nbeautifully than the best \u00c6gyptian marble.\n\n'Twere endless to proceed; nor is it needful: one object will not fail\nto lead on to another, and every where the goodness of his God will\nshine before him even in what are thought the vilest things; his\ngreatness in the lead of them.\n\nLet him pursue these thoughts, and seek abroad the objects and the\ninstigations to them: but let him in these and all other excursions\navoid equally the dews of early morning, and of evening.\n\nThe more than usual exercise of this prescription will dispose him to\nmore than customary sleep, let him indulge it freely; so far from\nhurting, it will help his cure.\n\nLet him avoid all excesses: drink need scarce be named, for we are\nwriting to men of better and of nobler minds, than can be tempted to\nthat humiliating vice. Those who in this disorder have too great an\nappetite, must not indulge it; much eaten was never well digested: but\nof all excesses the most fatal in this case is that of venery. It is the\nexcess we speak of.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VII. - The proper DIET.\n\n\nIn the first place acids must be avoided carefully; and all things that\nare in a state of fermentation, for they will breed acidity. Provisions\nhardened by salting never should be tasted; much less those cured by\nsmoaking, and by salting. Bacon is indigestible in an Hypochondriac\nstomach; and hams, impregnated as is now the custom, with acid fumes\nfrom the wood fires over which they are hung, have that additional\nmischief.\n\nMilk ought to be a great article in the diet: and even in this there\nshould be choice. The milk of grass-fed cows has its true quality: no\nother. There are a multitude of ways in which this may be made a part\nboth of our foods and drinks, and they should all be used.\n\nThe great and general caution is that the diet be at all times of a kind\nloosening and gently stimulating; light but not acrid. Veal, lamb,\nfowls, lobsters, crabs, craw-fish, fresh water fish and mutton broth,\nwith plenty of boiled vegetables, are always right; and give enough\nvariety.\n\nRaw vegetables are all bad: sour wines, old cheese, and bottled beer are\nthings never to be once tasted. Indeed much wine is wrong, be it of what\nkind soever. It is the first of cordials; and as such I would have it\ntaken in this disease when it is wanted: plainly as a medicine, rather\nthan a part of diet. Malt liquor carefully chosen is certainly the best\ndrink. This must be neither new, nor tending to sourness; perfectly\nclear, and of a moderate strength: it is the native liquor of our\ncountry, and the most healthful.\n\nToo much tea weakens; and even sugar is in this disorder hurtful: but\nhoney may supply its place in most things; and this is not only harmless\nbut medicinal; a very powerful dissolvent of impacted humours, and a\ngreat deobstruent.\n\nWhat wine is drank should be of some of the sweet kinds. Old Hock has\nbeen found on enquiry to yield more than ten times the acid of the sweet\nwines; and in red Port, at least in what we are content to call so,\nthere is an astringent quality, that is most mischievous in these cases:\nit is said there is often alum in it: how pregnant with mischief that\nmust be to persons whose bowels require to be kept open, is most\nevident. Summer fruits perfectly ripe are not only harmless but\nmedicinal; but if eaten unripe they will be very prejudicial. A light\nsupper, which will leave an appetite for a milk breakfast, is always\nright; this will not let the stomach be ravenous for dinner, as it is\napt to be in those who make that their only meal.\n\nOne caution more must be given, and it may seem a strange one: it is\nthat the patient attend regularly to his hours of eating. We have to do\nwith men for the most part whose soul is the great object of their\nregard; but let them not forget they have a body.\n\nThe late Dr. STUKELY has told me, that one day by appointment visiting\nSir ISAAC NEWTON, the servant told him, he was in his study. No one was\npermitted to disturb him there; but as it was near dinner time, the\nvisitor sat down to wait for him. After a time dinner was brought in; a\nboil'd chicken under a cover. An hour pass'd, and Sir ISAAC did not\nappear. The doctor eat the fowl, and covering up the empty dish, bad\nthem dress their master another. Before that was ready, the great man\ncame down; he apologiz'd for his delay, and added, \"give me but leave to\ntake my short dinner, and I shall be at your service; I am fatigued and\nfaint.\" Saying this, he lifted up the cover; and without any emotion,\nturned about to STUKELY with a smile; \"See says he, what we studious\npeople are, I forgot I had din'd.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VIII. - The MEDICINE.\n\n\n'Tis the ill fate of this disease, more than of all others to be\nmisunderstood at first, and thence neglected; till the physician shakes\nhis head at a few first questions. None steals so fatally upon the\nsufferer: its advances are by very slow degrees; but every day it grows\nmore difficult of cure.\n\nThat this obstruction in the spleen is the true malady, the cases\nrelated by the antients, present observation, and the unerring\ntestimonies of dissections leave no room to doubt. Being understood, the\npath is open where to seek a remedy: and our best guides in this, as in\nthe former instance, will be those venerable Greeks; who saw a thousand\nof these cases, where we see one; and with less than half our theory,\ncured twice as many patients.\n\nOne established doctrine holds place in all these writers; that whatever\nby a hasty fermentation dissolves the impacted matter of the\nobstruction, and sends it in that state into the blood, does incredible\nmischief: but that whatever medicine softens it by slow degrees, and, as\nit melts, delivers it to the bowels without disturbance; will cure with\nequal certainty and safety.\n\nFor this good purpose, they knew and tried a multitude of herbs; but in\nthe end they fixed on one: and on their repeated trials of this, they\nbanished all the rest. This stood alone for the cure of the disease; and\nfrom its virtue received the name of SPLEEN-WORT. O wise and happy\nGreeks! authors of knowledge and perpetuators of it! With them the very\nname they gave a plant declared its virtues: with us, a writer calls a\nplant from some friend; that the good gardener who receives the honour,\nmay call another by his name who gave it. We now add the term smooth\nto this herb, to distinguish it from another, called by the same general\nterm, though not much resembling it.\n\nThe virtues of this smooth Spleen-wort have flood the test of ages; and\nthe plant every where retained its name and credit: and one of our good\nherbalists, who had seen a wonderful case of a swoln spleen, so big, and\nhard as to be felt with terror, brought back to a state of nature by it;\nand all the miserable symptoms vanish; thought Spleen-wort not enough\nexpressive of its excellence; but stamp'd on it the name of MILT-WASTE.\n\nIn the Greek Islands now, the use of it is known to every one; and even\nthe lazy monks who take it, are no longer splenetic. In the west of\nEngland, the rocks are stripped of it with diligence; and every old woman\ntells you how charming that leaf is for bookish men: in Russia they use\na plant of this kind in their malt liquor: it came into fashion there\nfor the cure of this disease; which from its constant use is scarce\nknown any longer; and they suppose 'tis added to their liquor for a\nflavour.\n\nThe ancients held it in a kind of veneration; and used what has been\ncalled a superstition in the gathering it. It was to be taken up with a\nsharp knife, without violence, and laid upon the clean linen: no time\nbut the still darkness of the night was proper, and even the moon was\nnot to shine upon it. I know they have been ridiculed for this; for\nnothing is so vain as learned ignorance: but let me be permitted once to\nvindicate them.\n\nThe plant has leaves that can close in their sides; and their under part\nis covered thick with a yellow powder, consisting of the seeds, and seed\nvessels: in these they knew the virtue most resided: this was the golden\ndust they held so valuable; and this they knew they could not be too\ncautious to preserve. They were not ignorant of the sleep of plants; a\nmatter lately spoken of by some, as if a new discovery; and being\nsensible that light, a dry air, an expanded leaf, and a tempestuous\nseason, were the means of losing this fine dust; and knowing also that\ndarkness alone brought on that closing of the leaf which thence has\nbeen called sleep; and which helped to defend and to secure it, they\ntherefore took such time, and used such means as could best preserve the\nplant entire; and even save what might be scattered from it.--And now\nwhere is their superstition?\n\nFrom this plant thus collected they prepared a medicine, which in a\ncourse of forty days scarce ever failed to make a perfect cure.\n\nWe have the plant wild with us; and till the fashion of rough chemical\npreparations took off our attention from these gentler remedies, it was\nin frequent use and great repute. I trust it will be so again: and many\nthank me for restoring it to notice.\n\nSpleen-wort gives out its virtues freely in a tincture; and a small dose\nof this, mixing readily with the blood and juices, gradually dissolves\nthe obstruction; and by a little at a time delivers its contents to be\nthrown off without pain, from the bowels. Let this be done while the\nviscera are yet sound and the cure is perfect. More than the forty days\nof the Greek method is scarce ever required; much oftener two thirds of\nthat time suffice; and every day, from the first dose of it, the patient\nfeels the happy change that is growing in his constitution. His food no\nmore turns putrid on his stomach, but yields its healthful nourishment.\n\nThe swelling after meals therefore vanishes; and with that goes the\nlowness, and anxiety, the difficult breath, and the distracting cholick:\nhe can bear the approach of rainy weather without pain; he finds himself\nmore apt for motion, and ready to take that exercise which is to be\nassistant in his cure; life seems no longer burthensome. His bowels get\ninto the natural condition of health, and perform their office once at\nleast a day; better if a little more: the dull and dead colour of his\nskin goes off, his lips grow red again, and every sign of health\nreturns.\n\nLet him who takes the medicine, say whether any thing here be\nexaggerated. Let him, if he pleases to give himself the trouble, talk\nover with me, or write to me, this gradual decrease of his complaints,\nas he proceeds in his cure. My uncertain state of health does not\npermit me to practise physic in the usual way, but I am very desirous to\ndo what good I can, and shall never refuse my advice, such as it may be,\nto any person rich or poor, in whatever manner he may apply for it. I\nshall refer him to no apothecary, whose bills require he should be\ndrenched with potions; but tell him, in this as in all other cases,\nwhere to find some simple herb; which he may if he please prepare\nhimself; or if he had rather spare that trouble, may have it so prepared\nfrom me.\n\nWith regard to Spleen-wort, no method of using it is more effectual than\nsimply taking it in powder; the only advantage of a tincture, is that a\nproper dose may be given, and yet the stomach not be loaded with so\nlarge a quantity: it is an easier and pleasanter method, and nothing\nmore.\n\nIf any person choose to take it in the other way, I should still wish\nhim once at least to apply to me; that he may be assured what he is\nabout to take is the right plant. Abuses in medicines are at this time\nvery great, and in no instance worse than what relates to herbs. The\nbest of our physicians have complained upon this head with warmth, but\nwithout redress: they know the virtues and the value of many of our\nnative plants, but dread to prescribe them; lest some wrong thing should\nbe administered in their place; perhaps inefficacious, perhaps\nmischievous, nay it may be fatal. The few simple things I direct are\nalways before me; and it will at all times be a pleasure to me, in this\nand any other instance, to see whether what any person is about to take\nbe right. I have great obligations to the public, and this is the best\nreturn that I know how to make.\n\nTo see the need of such a caution, hear a transaction but of yesterday!\n\nAn intelligent person was directed to go to the medicinal herb shops in\nthe several markets, and buy some of this Spleen-wort; the name was\nwritten, and shewn to every one; every shop received his money, and\nalmost every one sold a different plant, under the name of this: but\nwhat is very striking, not one of them the right. Such is the chance of\nhealth in those hands through which the best means of it usually pass;\neven in the most regular course of application.\n\nI would not be understood to limit the little services I may this way be\nable to render the afflicted, to this single instance; much less to\npropose to myself any advantages from it. Whoever pleases will be\nwelcome to me, upon any such occasion; and whatever be the herb on which\nhe places a dependance, he shall be shewn it growing. I once recommended\na garden to be established for this use, at the public expence: one\ngreat person has put it in my power to answer all its purposes.\n\n                        F  I  N  I  S.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris, he was\n\"nominated\" to the Academy. He had but to present an Historical\nPainting in order to take his seat as an Academician.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VENUS AND MARRIAGE\n\n\nBack in his beloved Paris again; thrilled by the atmosphere and gaiety\nof its merry life; in the full vigour of manhood on the eve of his\nthirties; amongst congenial friends; done with the drudgery of winning\nto Academic honour, Boucher saw that the public were not falling over\neach other to purchase religious or historic pictures; he straightway\nturned his back upon these things, and on the edge of his thirtieth\nyear he gave to the world his \"Marriage of the Children of God with\nthe Children of Men,\" in which Venus is the avowed mistress of his\nadoration. It caused a fine stir, and greatly increased his repute.\n\nIn this picture he ends his Italian period and strikes his own\npersonal note. Both this and the \"Venus asking arms for Aeneas from\nVulcan,\" together with the \"Birth of Adonis\" and the \"Death of\nAdonis,\" of about the same period, still show Boucher strongly under\nthe influence of his master, Lemoyne. Indeed, the \"Birth\" and \"Death\nof Adonis,\" their record lost during the scuffle and confusion of the\nRevolution, for long hung side by side as pictures by Lemoyne, until,\nbeing cleaned about 1860, Boucher's initials were discovered upon\nthem, and, contemporary engravings being hunted up, still further\nproved their origin. But in the Venus that now figures in all his\nworks there is that flesh-painting of the nude, and that rosy touch\nupon the flesh of the female figure, that are a far more certain\nsignature of Boucher's handiwork than any written name.\n\nUnfortunately the Salons were closed during Boucher's earlier years\nuntil he was thirty-four, and the record of his work during these\nyears is difficult to follow; but with his service to Venus his\npersonal career begins, and the stream of his Venus-pieces steadily\nflows from his hands.\n\nHe came to her service rid of all prentice essays in craftsmanship, a\nfinished and consummate artist. He found in his subject a goddess to\nwhom he could devote his great and splendid gifts. He painted her\ndainty body with a radiant delight and a rare colour-sense such as\nFrance had never before seen or uttered. He remains to this day the\nfirst painter of the subtle, delicate, and elusive thing that is\nfemininity; he caught her allure, her charm, as he was to catch the\nfragrance and charm of children and flowers; and he set the statement\nof these things upon canvas as they have never been uttered.\n\nThe whole of his life long, Boucher gave himself up with equal and\npassionate devotion to work and to pleasure--working at his easel\noften twelve hours of his day without losing, to the end when the\nbrush fell from his dead fingers, his blitheness of heart or his\ngenerosity of act, and without weakening the pleasure-loving desires\nof his gadding spirit. Out of his splendid toil he made the means to\nindulge his tastes for pleasure; and the gratifying of his tastes in\nturn renewed and created the ideas that made the subjects of his\nartistry. He brought to all he did a joy in the doing that made of his\nvast labour one long pleasure--of his pleasures a riot of industry. He\nplayed as he toiled, scarce knowing which was play and which toil.\n\nThe gossip of his love-affairs makes no romantic story--they were but\ncommonplace ecstasies with unknown frail women. But hard as he worked\nand lived and played, he found time to get himself married in his\nthirtieth year to pretty seventeen-year-old Marie Jeanne Buseau, a\nlittle Parisian--and for love of her, so far as he understood the\nbusiness; for she brought him no dowry.\n\nThe young couple settled down for the next ten years in the Rue\nSaint-Thomas-du-Louvre. Here Boucher lived through his thirties.\n\nMadame was a pretty creature, if we had but Latour's pastel portrait\nalone to prove it. But the pretty features were the crown to as pretty\na body, for she sat often to her lord; and it is clear from his\ncorrespondence with a friend, Bachaumont, that she is the Psyche of\nhis illustrated fable--and Psyche runs much to the Altogether.\n\nMarriage, however, was not likely to imprison Boucher's gadding eyes;\nand it did not. Madame Boucher seems to have had as frail a heart, and\navoided strife by amusing herself, amongst others, with the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who, to gain access to the lady,\ncommissioned Boucher to do the Watteau-like illustrations to\nAcajou--a dull affair. Boucher's pretty wife, herself no mean\nartist, worked in his studio, and painted several smaller canvases\nafter his pictures, gaining some fame as a miniaturist and engraver.\n\nNor did Marriage turn Boucher from his art. Two years were gone by\nsince his nomination to the Academy; he had now to paint the formal\nHistorical Picture and present it in order to take his seat as\nAcademician; and it was in this his thirtieth year that he painted and\nwon his academic rank with the \"Renauld et Armide\" now at the Louvre.\n\nHere he sufficiently subordinated his own style to the academic to\nensure success; and the work was hailed by Academicians and critics,\nincluding Diderot, with enthusiasm. But even here we have his cupids\npeeping round the mythologic event; and Armide herself has pretty\nFrench lips that knew no Greek.\n\nOnce secure of his position, he straightway flung the last remnants of\nthe academic style out of his studio door; and it is a grim comment on\ncriticism that it was just exactly in proportion as he developed his\nown personal genius and uttered the France of his day, that he was\nattacked; whilst the stilted things that he knew were third-rate, and\nwhich he wholly rejected from henceforth, were exactly the things that\nwere praised!\n\nHis election to the Academy, and the enthusiasm over the picture that\nwon him his seat thereat, brought his name before the young king; the\nfollowing year he received his first order from the Court whose\npainter he was destined to become. The decorations in the queen's\napartments were gloomy and had grown black; and he painted in their\nstead the \"Charity,\" \"Abundance,\" \"Fidelity,\" and \"Prudence\" still\nthere to be seen. Indeed, with his gay vision, his pretty habit of\nculling only the flowers from the garden of life, and his quickness to\nset down the pleasing thing in every prospect, Boucher was the\ndestined painter of a Court weary of pomposity and the pose of the\nmock-heroic, and which was wholly giving itself up to pleasure and the\nelegances.\n\nBut neither his new dignity of Academician nor the royal favour, kept\nhim from the bookshops; and he illustrated, with rare beauty and a\ncharm worthy of Watteau, the great edition of the Works of Moli\u00e8re\nin his thirty-first year. It is true that he made as free with\nMoli\u00e8re's world as with the Gods of Olympus; he peoples the plays with\ncharacters of his own day, arrayed in the dress and habit of that day,\nand moving in surroundings that he saw about him.\n\n\nLE MONDE QUI S'AMUSE\n\n\nThe Homely had come upon the town out of Holland, painted with most\nconsummate artistry by Chardin, and was soon in the vogue. Boucher had\na quick eye for the mode. And he straightway set himself to the\npainting of \"La Belle Cuisini\u00e8re.\" Still-life and homely subjects need\nan accuracy of realism and a Dutch sense of these things, a sense of\nsincerity and an appreciation of the dignity of the work-a-day life of\nthe people, in which Boucher was wholly lacking. Above all, it calls\nfor a sense of \"character,\" which, in Boucher, was always weak. It was\na sneer against him that his very broomsticks called for pompons and\nribbons--and there was more than a little truth in the spite. He is\nmore concerned with the accident of the kissing of a kitchen-maid than\nwith the kitchen's habit. He cannot even peep into a scullery without\ndragging in Venus by the skirts, and tricking her out in a\nproperty-wardrobe of a scullery-wench, in which the girl is clearly\nbut acting the part.\n\nHowever, these passing vogues and experiments in different methods\nwere only gay asides--he was working the while upon his own subjects;\nand, to the display by its several members ordered by the Academy, he\nsent four little paintings of fauns and cupids which won him the\nhonour of election as deputy-professor. His brain and hand were very\nbusy, and he turns from one thing to another with amazing facility,\nbringing distinction to all that he does.\n\nBut he painted about this time two pictures of infants, \"L'Amour\nOiseleur\" and \"L'Amour Moissonneur,\" which were the beginning of that\nhost of cupids that he let fly from his studio; they frolic across his\ncanvases and join the retinue of Venus, peeping out from clouds, over\nwaves, round curtains, painted with a perfection that has never been\nsurpassed in the portrayal of infants. He painted their round limbs,\ntheir lusty life, their delightful awkwardnesses, their jolly fat\ngrace, their na\u00efve surprise at life and glory in it, as they had never\nbeen painted before, and have never been painted since.\n\nHe also gave forth in this his thirty-third year a \"Pastoral\" and a\n\"Shepherd and Shepherdess in Conversation,\" with sheep about them and\nin a pleasant landscape, which were his first essays in the style that\nhe created and which made him famous.\n\nHis friend Meissonnier, the inventor of the rococo, stood godfather to\nBoucher's first-born son in the May of 1736.\n\nFrom the very beginning Boucher seems to have been engraved. And these\nengravings, done by the best gravers of his day, greatly extended his\nreputation and popularised him; he fully realised the value of the\nadvertisement as well as his profits from it. Before his thirty-third\nyear was run out he published his well-known \"Cries of Paris.\"\n\nBoucher's description of them, \"studies from the low classes,\" holds\nthe key to that something of failure to realise the dramatic verities\nthat is over all; it gives also the attitude of the France that he\nknew towards the France that he did not, and could not understand. He\ncreated that dainty, pleasant atmosphere that comes floating up to the\nwindows on a fresh morning in Paris from the musical cries of\nthe street vendors; but of the deeper significance of the\nstreet-sellers--of the miserable accent in their life, of their weary\ntoil, of the dignity of their labour--he knew nothing; his brush could\nnot refrain from making elegance and fine manners peep from behind the\nstreet-porter's fustian or the milkmaid's skirt.\n\nBut his thirty-third year was to contain a more far-reaching\nsignificance even than the creation of his cupid-pieces and pastorals.\n\nThe \"Cries of Paris\" were scarce printed when Boucher's illustration\nto \"Don Quixote\" appeared--\"Sancho pursued by the servants of the\nDuke.\" This design was to have far-reaching results that Boucher\nlittle suspected.\n\nThe painter Oudry had been called to the conduct of the great tapestry\nlooms at Beauvais a couple of years before; and in his efforts to\nfurnish the looms with good designs, he now called Boucher to his aid,\nwhose original and fresh style, colour, and arrangement, together with\nhis personal vision, and the enthusiasm and zeal with which he threw\nhimself into the work, at once increased the reputation and the\nproducts of the famous looms. This large designing for the tapestries\nwas, in return, of immense value to the development of the genius of\nthe man, enlarging his breadth of style and giving scope to that great\ndecorative sense that was his superb gift. Thenceforth he was destined\nto play a supreme part in the history of the world-famed factories. He\nnow produced painting after painting for the Beauvais looms.\n\nLife is now one long triumph for Boucher, only disturbed in this year\nby the sad news of the suicide of his old master, Lemoyne. It was in\nthis, Boucher's thirty-fourth year, that the Salon was opened for the\nfirst time since Boucher's infancy, and he contributed several\ncanvases to it.\n\nRigaud, the old Academician, now close upon eighty, straggling through\nthe great galleries, might well blink and gasp at the change that had\ncome over French art since he last exhibited there, thirty-three years\ngone by; but his scoffs and regrets held no terrors for the younger\nAcademicians gathered about. He stood in a new world. A new generation\nwas in possession. The grand manner, the severe etiquette, formal\nmock-heroics, and solemn pomposity of Louis the Fourteenth were\nvanished, and the Agreeable and the Pleasant Make-Believe of Louis the\nFifteenth reigned in their stead. Old Rigaud might blink indeed! Just\nas the imposing and stilted etiquette of the reception-room had given\nplace to the easy manners and airy etiquette of the dainty boudoir, so\nhad light chatter and gay wit and the quick repartee usurped the heavy\nsplendours of a consequential age. France, weary of an eternal pose of\nthe grand manner, was seeking change in joyousness and amusement.\n\nGallantry and gaiety were become the object of the ambition of a\ndandified and elegant day. France became a coquette; dressed herself\nas a porcelain shepherdess; and with beribboned crook and sheep,\nseeking pleasant prospects to stroll through, gave herself to\ndalliance--her powder-puff and patch-box and fan a serious part of her\nunseriousness.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE CH\u00c2TEAUROUX\n\n\nAt thirty-five Boucher has arrived. He is in the vogue; in favour at\nCourt--as well as in the fashion. In his three years from taking his\nseat at the Academy to the opening of the first Salon he has created a\nnew and original style--his cupid pieces, his pastorals, his\nVenus-pieces, his tapestry. Boucher's kingdom lay in the realm of the\ndecorative painter--and he has found it. Torn from the surroundings\nfor which he designed them, as part and parcel of the general scheme,\nhis pictures are as out of place as an Italian altarpiece in an\nEnglish dining-room, yet they suffer less. Several may still be seen,\nas he set them up in frames of his own planning, as overdoors in the\npalace of the Soubise, now given up to the national archives.\n\nThe ghost of the Prince of Soubise, who commissioned them, may haunt\nhis palace, but his kin know the place no longer. The overdoors\nwrought by Boucher's skill look down now on the nation's collection of\nhistoric documents. The \"Three Graces enchaining Love,\" the fine\npastoral of \"The Cage,\" and the pastoral of the \"Shepherd placing a\nRose in his Shepherdess's Hair,\" were to see a mightier change than\nthe usurpation of Louis the Fourteenth's pompous age by the elegant\nyears of Louis the Fifteenth. But this was not as yet. Here at least\nwe see Boucher's art rid of all outside influences, and at the full\ntide of creation; here we have the inimitable lightness of touch, the\nfigures and landscape bathed in the airy volume of atmosphere.\n\nHe seems at this time to have played with pastel, due probably to his\nfriendship with Latour, who sent a portrait of Boucher's wife to this\nSalon. Boucher showed in the use of chalks the artistry and skill that\nwere always at his command.\n\nHe also was putting to its full use his innate sense of landscape,\nraising to high achievement that astonishing balance of landscape and\nfigures in his design--a balance that has never been surpassed; his\nfigures never override his landscape; his landscape never overpowers\nhis figures. His earnest counsels to his pupils and his constant\ndeploring of the lack of the landscape art in France prove the great\nstress he laid upon it.\n\nThe designing of a frontispiece for the catalogue of a personal\nfriend, one Gersaint, a merchant of oriental wares, started Boucher in\nhis thirty-third year upon that series of Chinese pictures and\ntapestries known as the \"Chinoiseries,\" in which he frittered away\nonly too many precious hours, for they were received with great favour\nby the public. The paintings of Chinese subjects designed for the\nlooms of Beauvais are still to be seen at Besan\u00e7on.\n\nBut busy as were his brain and hand in the exercise of his wide and\nversatile gifts, pouring out \"Chinoiseries,\" illustrations for books,\ntapestries on a large scale, landscapes, models for the gilt bronze\ndecorations of porcelain vases, scheming handsome frames for his\npictures, designing furniture and fans--Boucher was true, above all,\n\"to his goddess,\" and painted the famed \"Birth of Venus,\" which,\nthanks to the Swedish Ambassador's fondness for Madame Boucher, now\nhangs at Stockholm; our amorous Count de Tessin, to be just, seems to\nhave had a rare flair for the artistic--besides artist's wives. It was\non the 15th of April in 1742, the last year of his thirties, that the\nRoyal favour was marked by the grant of a pension of 400 livres\n(double florins) to Boucher with promise of early benefits to follow.\n\nTwo years afterwards it was raised to 600 livres.\n\nThis was the year that he painted the beautiful canvas of \"Diana\nleaving the Bath with one of her Companions,\" now at the Louvre. It\nwas also the year that saw his landscape, the \"Hamlet of Iss\u00e9\" at the\nSalon. This \"Hameau d'Iss\u00e9\" was to be enlarged for the Opera, proving\nhim to be decorator there, where he was arranging waterfalls,\ncascades, and the rest of the pretty business, without staying his\nhand from his art.\n\nAt forty Boucher has come into his kingdom. The ten years of these\nforties were to be a vast triumph for him. He was to produce\nmasterpiece after masterpiece. His art had caught the taste of the\nday. He was at the height of his powers. He had done great things--he\nwas to do greater. During these ten years of his forties he poured\nforth vivid and glowing works of sustained power and originality.\n\nWe have a picture of him as he was in the flesh at this time--the\npastel portrait by Lundberg, now at the Louvre--a gay, somewhat\ndissipated, handsomely dressed dandy of the time, smiling out of his\ncareless day, the debonnair man of fashion, the laughing eyes showing\nsigns of the night carousals, which were the rest from the prodigious\ntoil of this vital and forthright spirit.\n\nIt was in this our artist's fortieth year that the gifted old Cardinal\nFleury, who had guided the fortunes of France with rare skill, died,\nbroken by his ninety years and the blunders of the disastrous war that\nhe had so strenuously opposed; and Louis, essaying the strut of\nkingship, became king by act. His indolent character, unequal to the\nmighty business, his indeterminate will fretted by the set of\nquarrelling and intriguing rogues that he gathered about him as his\nministers, he fell into the habit that became his thenceforth, the\nonly thing to which he paid the tribute of constancy--he ruled France\nfrom behind pretty petticoats. He had early shown the adulterous blood\nof his great-grandfather; two, if not three, of five sisters of the\nnoble and historic house of De Nesle had yielded to his gadding fancy;\nthe youngest now ousted her sister De Mailly from the king's favour,\nwas publicly acknowledged as the king's mistress, and became Duchess\nof Ch\u00e2teauroux. Boucher painted her handsome being as a shepherdess in\none of his pastorals. She was no ordinary toy of a king. A woman of\ntalent, with hot ambitions for the king's majesty, fired with the\npride of race of the old French noblesse, it was during her short\nyears of ascendancy over the king that he roused from his body's\ntorpor and made an effort to reach the dignity and eminence befitting\nto the lord of a great and gallant people. He stepped forth awhile\nfrom his drunken bouts and manifold mean adulteries, and set himself\nat the head of the army in Flanders, and strutted it as conqueror.\n\nPoor Ch\u00e2teauroux only got the hate of the people for reward, Louis the\nhonours; for the people resented the public dishonour of her state.\n\nPower she found to be a dead-sea apple in her pretty mouth. The glory\nof it all, the splendours, were not the easily won delights for which\nshe had looked. She had to fight a duel, that never ended, with the\nking's witty, crafty, and scurrilous Prime Minister, the notorious\nMaurepas--and Maurepas willed that no woman should ever come between\nhim and the king--Maurepas who knew no mercy, no decency, no chivalry,\nno scruple. At Ch\u00e2teauroux's urging, Louis placed himself at the\nhead of the army; and France went near mad with joy that she had\nagain found a king. Crafty Maurepas urged on the business; the\nCh\u00e2teauroux suddenly realised his cunning glee--it separated her from\nthe king.\n\nOut of the whirl of things Boucher's fortune was ripening, little as\nhe might suspect it.\n\nHe was painting masterpieces that make his name live. To his fortieth\nyear belong the famed \"Birth of Venus,\" the \"Venus leaving the Bath,\"\nthe \"Muse Clio,\" the \"Muse Melpomene,\" and the three well-known\npastorals now at the Louvre--\"The Sleeping Shepherdess,\" the \"Nest,\"\n\n\nand the \"Shepherd and Shepherdesses.\" Of the many famous Venus-pieces\nthat his hand painted during these years it is not easy to write the\nlist. But having signed the \"Marriage of Love and Psyche\" at\nforty-one, he turned his experimental hand to the homely, realistic\nDutch style that was having a wide vogue, and painted the\n\"Dejeuner\"--a family of the prosperous class of the day at\nbreakfast--showing with rare charm the surroundings and home life of\nthe well-to-do of his time.\n\nAll goes well with Boucher. He changes into better quarters in the Rue\nde Grenelle-Saint-Honor\u00e9, where he lived for the next five years,\nuntil 1749; but his eyes are fixed upon a studio and apartments at\nthe old palace of the Louvre, though the hard intriguing of his\npowerful friends at Court on his behalf failed for some time. He had,\nindeed, to make another move before he arrived at his longed-for goal.\n\nPensions Boucher, like others, had found to be somewhat empty affairs;\nbut rooms at the Louvre were a solid possession eagerly sought after\nby the artists.\n\nIn this year of 1744 Boucher created a new fashion at the annual Salon\nby sending studies and sketches instead of finished pictures; and it\nset a value upon such things not before realised by artists, for\nsuccess was instant and loud.\n\nTowards the end of the next, Boucher's forty-second year, the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who was to take his leave of Paris,\ncommissioned four pictures to represent the day of a woman of fashion,\nand to be entitled \"Morning,\" \"Midday,\" \"Evening,\" and \"Night.\"\n\nBoucher painted one of these for him, now known as the \"Marchande de\nModes.\" The others were painted later, and all had a wide vogue as\nengravings. The correspondence has interest since it reveals Boucher's\nbusiness habits; he was paid for a picture on its delivery, and for\neach of these he was to receive 600 livres (double florins or\ndollars)--about a hundred and twenty pounds.\n\nIn an official document of the Director of Buildings to the king (or\nMinister of Fine Art, as we should say), written in this year of 1745,\nBoucher being forty-two, is a \"list of the best painters,\" in which\nBoucher is singled out for distinction as \"an historic painter, living\nin the Rue de Grenelle-Saint-Honor\u00e9, opposite the Rue des Deux-Ecus,\npupil of Lemoyne, excelling also in landscape, grotesques, and\nornaments in the manner of Watteau; and equally skilled in painting\nflowers, fruit, architecture, and subjects of gallantry and of\nfashion.\"\n\nNot so bad for dry officialdom; the critics could learn a lesson. For\nhe was nothing less. What indeed does he not do? and wondrous well!\nthis painter of the age.\n\nAnd the mighty rush of events is about to sweep him into further\nprominence; the very things which he probably passed by with a gay\nshrug are to enrich him, to help him to his highest fulfilment.\n\nPoor Ch\u00e2teauroux saw that she must lose the king's gadding favour in\nthe conflict with Maurepas unless she joined her lord, now with the\narmy. She realised full well that she had created the new Louis of\nAmbition--that her going must bring the people's hate to her. But she\ndared not lose the king. And she went. Maurepas had overdone his\njibings. The indiscretion at once rang through the land; became the\njest of the army--and Maurepas was not far from the bottom of the\nbusiness. The discreet indiscretion of covered ways between the king's\nlodgings and hers only added to the mockeries, and increased the\npeople's hate against, of course, the Ch\u00e2teauroux. Then upon a day in\nAugust the small-pox seized Louis at Metz; poor Ch\u00e2teauroux fought for\npossession of the king in the sick room, until his fear of\ndeath--Louis' sole piety--sent her packing--shrinking back in the\nhired carriage at each halting-place for change of horses, lest she\nshould be seen and torn from her place and destroyed by the populace.\n\nBut Louis recovered; Paris rang with bells at joy on his recovery, and\nhe entered the city amidst mad enthusiasm, hailed as The Well-Beloved.\n\nHe sent for the Ch\u00e2teauroux to find her dying, Maurepas having to\ndeliver the message of recall. She died suddenly and in great agony,\nswearing that Maurepas had poisoned her--died in the arms of her poor\ndiscarded sister, the De Mailly.\n\nBut this year of 1745 Boucher hears a mightier scandal that is to mean\nvast things to all France--and not least of all to Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE POMPADOUR\n\n\nA young bride had become the gossip of the rich merchant society of\nParis--that class that was ousting the old noblesse from power. She\nwas a beautiful, a remarkable woman; her wit was repeated in the\ndrawing-rooms, she had all the accomplishments; her charming\nname--Madame Lenormant d'Etioles.\n\nDraw aside the curtains of the past and we discover our little Jeanne\nPoisson--grown into this exquisite creature. It has come about in\nstrange fashion enough. The father--a scandalous fellow--having\nfingered the commissariat moneys in ugly ways to his own use, had been\nbanished for the ugly business. Nor is Jeanne's mother any better than\nshe should be; and the wags wink knowingly at the handsome and rich\nman of fashion, Monsieur Lenormant de Tournehem, who has been the\nfavoured gallant during the absence of the light-fingered Poisson.\n\nAnd, of a truth, Lenormant de Tournehem takes astonishing interest in\nthe little Jeanne--watching over her up-growing and giving her the\nbest of education at the convent, where she wins all hearts, and is\nknown as \"the little queen.\" The truth spoken with wondrous prophecy,\nif unthinkingly, as we shall see. Complacent Poisson came home, and\ntook the rich and fashionable, bland and smiling Lenormant de\nTournehem to his arms. Has he not wealth and estates? therefore as\nexcellent a friend for Poisson as for Madame Poisson. The girl Jeanne\nleaves the convent to be taught the accomplishments by the supreme\nmasters of France, the wits foregather at Madame Poisson's, and the\nbrilliant Jeanne is soon mistress of the arts--coquetry not least of\nall; has also the most exquisite taste in dress. Under all is a heart\ncold as steel; calculating as the higher mathematics. She has but one\nhindrance to ambition--her mean birth. Lenormant de Tournehem rids her\neven of this slur by making his nephew, Lenormant d'Etioles, marry\nher, giving the young couple half his fortune for dowry, and the\npromise of the rest when he dies--also he grants him a splendid\ntown-house, as splendid a country seat. And consequential\nself-respecting little Lenormant d'Etioles is lord of Etioles, amongst\nother seignories. So Jane Fish appears as Madame Lenormant d'Etioles,\nseductive, beautiful, accomplished, to whose house repair the new\nphilosophy, the wits, and artists. She has a certain sense of virtue;\nindeed openly vows that no one but the king shall ever come between\nher and her lord. But, deep in her heart, she has harboured a fierce\nambition--that the king shall help her to keep her bond. She puts\nforth all her gifts, all her powers, to win to the strange goal;\nconfides it to her worldly mother and \"uncle,\" Lenormant de Tournehem;\nfinds keen allies therein to the reaching of that strange goal. The\ndeath of the Ch\u00e2teauroux clears the way. At a masked ball the king is\nintrigued as to the personality of a beautiful woman who plagues him\nwith her art; he orders the unmasking. Madame Lenormant d'Etioles\nstands revealed, drops her handkerchief as by accident; the whisper\nruns through the Court that \"the handkerchief has been thrown!\" The\nking stoops and picks it up. A few evenings later she is smuggled into\nthe \"private apartments.\" She goes again a month later; in the morning\nis seized with sudden terror--she daren't go back to her angry lord\nlest he do her grievous harm; he will have missed her. The king is\ntouched; allows her to hide from henceforth in the secret apartments;\npromises the beautiful creature a lodging, her husband's banishment,\nand early acknowledgment as titular mistress--before the whole Court\nat Easter, says the pious Great One. But he has to join the army to\nplay the Conqueror at Fontenoy; and it is later in the year\n(September) before Madame d'Etioles is presented to the Court in a\nvast company and proceeds to the queen's apartments to kiss hands on\nappointment. Thus was Jeanne Poisson raised to the great aristocracy\nof France in her twenty-third year as Marquise de Pompadour.\n\nBoucher had been one of the brilliant group of artists of the\nd'Etioles' circle. That the Pompadour's influence had much effect upon\nhis position at Court for a year or two is unlikely; for she had to\nfight for possession of the king day and night, as the Ch\u00e2teauroux\nhad done, against the queen's party and the unscrupulous enmity of\nMaurepas. To set down Boucher's favour at Court to her is ridiculous.\n\nHe was painting for the queen's apartments at thirty-one when the\nPompadour was a school-girl of twelve. But in the year following her\nrise to power, Boucher painted four pictures for the large room of the\nDauphin, which were \"placed elsewhere\"; and, the year after that, he\nwas at work upon two pictures for the bedroom of the king at the\ncastle of Marly. It is likely enough that the Pompadour directed this\norder. She had almost immediately secured the office of the\nDirector-General of Buildings, which covered the direction of the\nroyal art treasures, for \"uncle\" Lenormant de Tournehem, who was also\na friend of the artist. And from this year it is significant that\nBoucher paints no more for the opposing camp of the Queen and Dauphin.\n\nHe was now giving all his strength to the \"Rape of Europa\" that he\npainted for the competition ordered by the Academy at the command of\nLenormant de Tournehem in the king's name, in which ten chosen\nAcademicians were to paint subjects in their own style for six prizes\nand a gold medal, to be awarded in secret vote by the competing\nartists themselves. Boucher won, by his amiable nature, the good-will\nof them all by proposing that they should so arrange as to share the\nprizes equally, and thus prevent any sense of soreness inevitable in\nthe losers.\n\nBut greatly as he won the good-fellowship of his fellow-artists by it,\nthis picture caused a murmur to rise amongst the critics who,\naforetime loud in his praise, now began to complain of his \"abuse of\nrose tints\" in the painting of the female nude. The fact was that\nDiderot and the men of the New Philosophy were turning their eyes to\nthe whole foundations upon which France was built, art as well as\nsociety, and were beginning to demand of art \"grandeur and morality in\nits subjects.\" They were soon to be clamouring for \"the statement of a\ngreat maxim, a lesson for the spectator.\" Diderot, with bull-like\ncourage, picked out the greatest, and turned upon Boucher, blaming him\nfor triviality.\n\nThe nations, weary of war, concluded the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in\nthe October of 1748. No sooner was peace concluded than Louis\nrelapsed into his old habit of dandified indolence and profligate\nease; and, putting from him his duties as the lord of a great people,\nhe gave himself up to shameless intrigues. He allowed the Pompadour to\nusurp his magnificence and to rule over the land. He yielded himself\nutterly, if sometimes sulkily, to her domination; and for sixteen\nyears she was the most powerful person at Court, the greatest force in\nthe state--making and unmaking ministers, disposing of office,\nhonours, titles, pensions. All political affairs were discussed and\narranged under her guidance; ministers, ambassadors, generals\ntransacted their business in her stately boudoirs; the whole patronage\nof the sovereign was dispensed by her pretty hands; the prizes of the\nChurch, of the army, of the magistracy could be obtained solely\nthrough her favour and good-will. Her energy must have been\nprodigious. Possessed of extraordinary talents and exquisite tastes,\nshe gave full rein to them, and it was in the indulgence of her better\nqualities that Destiny brought Boucher into the friendship of this\nwonderful woman. She became not only his patron but his pupil,\nengraving several of his designs.\n\nBut this, her sovereignty over the king, easy and light in its outward\nseeming, was a haggard nightmare to the calculating woman who had so\nlonged for it. She knew no single hour's rest from the night she won\nto the king's bed. She had to fight her enemies, secret and open, for\npossession of the king's will, day and night; and she fought--with\nrare courage. She won by consummate skill and unending pluck. She made\nherself an essential part of the king's freedom from care. The Court\nparty fought her for power with constant vigilance. Maurepas brought\nall his unscrupulous art, all his ironic mimicry, all his vile jibes\nand unchivalrous hatred to bear against her. He had made himself a\nnecessity to the king; and he never slept away a chance of injuring\nher. He knew no mercy, no nobility, no pity. He made her the detested\nobject of the people. With his own hands he penned the witty verses\nand epigrams that were sung and flung about the streets of Paris.\n\nBut she had an enemy more subtle than any at the Court--hour by hour\nshe had to dispute the king with the king's boredom. And it was in the\neffort to do so that she created her celebrated theatre in the\nprivate apartments, calling Boucher and others to her aid in the doing\nof it. Here the noblest of France vied with each other to obtain the\nsmallest part to play, an instrument in its orchestra, an invitation\nto its performances.\n\nBoucher left the Opera to become its decorator in 1748, and did not\nreturn until her death. For her, he also decorated her beautiful rooms\nat Bellevue. She bought at high prices many of his greatest\nmasterpieces.\n\nThe Pompadour's power so greatly increased that she openly took\ncommand of the king's will; dared and succeeded in getting his\nfavourite Maurepas banished; and herself took to the use of the kingly\n\"we.\" Her rascally father was created Lord of Marigny; her brother,\nwhom the king liked well and called \"little brother,\" was created\nMarquis de Vandi\u00e8res; her only child, Alexandrine, signed her name as\na princess of the blood royal, and would have been married to the\nblood royal had she not caught the small-pox and died. She amassed a\nprivate fortune, castles, and estates such as no mistress had dreamed\nof; and into them she poured art treasures that cost the nation\nthirty-six millions of money. She created the porcelain factory of\nS\u00e8vres, kept keen watch over the Gobelins looms, and founded the great\nMilitary School of St. Cyr amidst work that would have kept several\nstatesmen busy, and of deadly intrigues at Court that would have\nbroken the spirit of many a brilliant man.\n\nIt was in her hectic desire to keep the king from being bored that she\nstooped, and made Boucher stoop, to the employment of his high\nartistry in the painting of a series of indecent pictures wherewith to\ntickle the jaded desires of Boredom, and thereby gave rise to the\nwidespread impression that Boucher's art was ever infected by base\ndesign. But Boucher was, at his very worst, but a healthy animal; and\neven in these secret works for the king he did not reach so low as did\nmany an artist of more pious memory who painted with no excuse but his\nown pleasure.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the Pompadour has been blamed too much for this\nevil act, and too much forgotten for her splendid patronage of the man\nwho, under it and during these great years of his forties, produced a\nseries of masterpieces that place him in the foremost rank of the\npainters of his century. It is impossible to reckon the number of the\npastorals and Venus-pieces that his master-hand painted and loved to\npaint, during these the supreme years of his genius. It is significant\nthat they were painted during the years that saw the Pompadour in\nsupreme power.\n\nBoucher was so firmly established in 1750, his forty-seventh year,\nthat he moved into a new house in the Rue Richelieu, near the Palais\nRoyal. Disappointed in not receiving a studio and apartments at the\nLouvre, he was allowed to use a studio in the king's library. He was\nnow making money so easily that he was able to collect pictures and\nprecious stones and the gaily coloured curiosities that appealed to\nhis tastes.\n\nThe critics were becoming more and more censorious; and one of them\nhits true with the comment that in his pastorals his shepherdesses\nlook as if they had stepped over from the Opera and would soon be off\nagain thereto.\n\nIn his forty-eighth year Boucher's art was at its most luminous\nstage--his atmosphere clear and subtle and exquisitely rendered; his\nyellows golden; his whites satin-like and silvery; his flesh-tones\nupon the nude bodies of his goddesses unsurpassed by previous art. The\nbeauty of it all was not to last much longer.\n\nLenormant de Tournehem died suddenly in the November of 1751; the\nPompadour's brother, Abel Poisson de Vandi\u00e8res, was appointed\nDirector-General in his stead at the age of twenty-five--and soon\nafterwards, on the death of his father, created Marquis de Marigny--a\nshy, handsome youth, a gentleman and an honourable fellow, whom the\nking liked well, and against whom his sister's sole complaint was that\nhe lacked the brazen effrontery of the courtiers of the day. No man\ndid more for the advancement of the art of his time. A pension of a\nthousand livres falling vacant, the young fellow secured it for\nBoucher; and almost immediately afterwards, a studio becoming vacant\nat the Louvre owing to the death of Coypel, first painter to the king,\nBoucher came to his coveted home, eagerly moving in with his family as\nsoon as its wretched state could be put into repair.\n\nThe decoration of the new wing to the palace at Fontainebleau brought\nthe commission for the painting of the ceiling and the principal\npicture in the Council Chamber to Boucher, who had already decorated\nthe Dining-Room. This was the period of his painting the \"Rising\" and\nthe \"Setting of the Sun\" for the Pompadour, now in the Watteau\ncollection, two canvases that were always favourites with the painter,\nbitterly as they were assailed by the critic Grimm.\n\nHe was turning out so much work that it was impossible to give as much\ncare to his pictures as he ought. For he refused sternly, his life\nlong, to raise his prices; by consequence he had to create a larger\namount of work in order to meet his expenditure. It was about this\ntime that Reynolds, passing through Paris, went to visit him and found\nhim painting on a huge canvas without models or sketches. \"On\nexpressing my surprise,\" writes Reynolds, \"he replied that he had\nconsidered the model as necessary during his youth until he had\ncompleted his study of art, but that he had not used one for a long\ntime past.\"\n\nHe soon had not the time, not only to paint from nature but even to\ngive his pictures the work necessary to complete them. The feverish\nhaste which took possession of him in his frantic endeavour to meet\nthe vast demand for his pictures, and the eager efforts of his\nengravers to satisfy the public call for engravings after his works,\ngave him less and less leisure to joy in their doing. And his eyesight\nbegan to fail. His flesh-tints deepened to a reddish hue; and he\nstands baffled before his work, suspecting his sight, since what every\none cries out upon as being bright vermilion, he only sees as a dull\nearthy colour. Boucher has topped the height of his achievement; he\nhas to \"descend the other side of the hill.\" Boucher begins to grow\nold.\n\nIn Boucher's fifty-first year an ugly intrigue of the queen's party at\nCourt to sap the Pompadour's influence over the king by drawing away\nthe king's affections towards Madame de Choiseul-Romanet, a reckless\nyoung beauty of the Court, brought about a strange alliance. The Count\nde Stainville, one of the Pompadour's bitterest enemies, was shown the\nking's letter of invitation to his young kinswoman; and he, deeply\nwounded in his pride that his kinswoman should have been offered to\nthe king, went to the Pompadour and exposed the plot. A close\nalliance followed; and De Stainville thenceforth became her chief\nguide in affairs of state. It was at her instance that the king called\nhim to be his Prime Minister, raising him to the Duchy of Choiseul--a\nname he made illustrious as one of the greatest Ministers of France.\n\nIn his fifty-second year Boucher was appointed to the directorship of\nthe Gobelins looms, to the huge delight of the weavers and all\nconcerned with the tapestry factory. This was the year of his painting\nthe famous portrait of the Pompadour, to whom he several times paid\nthis \"tribute of immorality.\" For the Gobelins looms he produced many\nhandsome designs; and he was painting with astounding industry. But\nhis hand's skill began to falter. His art shows weariness in his\nsixtieth year, and sickness fell upon him, and held him in servitude\nnow with rare moments of respite. The critics, notoriously Diderot,\nwere now attacking him with shameless virulence. Boucher passed it all\nby; but he felt the change that was taking place in the public taste.\n\nThe ideas of the New Philosophy were infecting public opinion; the Man\nof Feeling had arisen in the land; and France, humiliated in war, and\nresenting the follies and the greed of her shameless privileged class,\nwas openly resenting it and all its works. Choiseul had planted his\nstrength deep in the people's party, and was come near to being its\ngod. His masterly mind had checked Frederick of Prussia to the North;\nand the nations, exhausted by the struggle, signed the Peace of Paris\nin 1763. Choiseul, with France at peace abroad, turned to the blotting\nout of the turbulent order of the Jesuits at home. Their attempt to\nend the Pompadour's relations with the king made this powerful woman\neager to complete his design; the chance was soon to come, and the\nOrder was abolished from France and its vast property seized by the\nstate.\n\nThe Pompadour lived but a short while to enjoy her triumph. Worn out\nby her superhuman activities, assailed by debt, she fell ill of a\nracking cough, dying on the 15th of April, 1764, in her forty-second\nyear, keeping her ascendancy over the king and the supreme power in\nFrance to her last hour. Death found her transacting affairs of state.\n\nLouis, weary of his servitude, had only a heartless epigram to cast\nat the body of the dead woman as she passed to her last resting-place.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE END\n\n\nThe death of the Pompadour robbed Boucher of a friend; but her\nbrother, Marigny, remained faithfully attached to the old artist, and\nseized every chance to honour him. On the death of Carle van Loo,\nBoucher, at sixty-two, was made first painter to the king, with all\nhis pensions and privileges that were consistent with this the supreme\nappointment in the art world.\n\nThere had been serious intention of making Boucher the head of the\nEcole des El\u00e8ves Proteg\u00e9s; he had the art of making himself liked and\nof inspiring the love of the arts. He was very popular with the\nstudents and artists, owing to his kindliness, his eagerness to render\nservice, his readiness to encourage the youngsters or to console them.\n\nWhen the riot took place, provoked by the Academicians by their award\nof the Prix de Rome in 1767, the students insulted the Academicians,\nbut hailed Boucher with enthusiastic applause. The reason was not far\nto seek. When a student came to the old master for advice he did not\n\"play the pontiff,\" and, scorning the false dignity of big phrases, he\ntook the brush in his hand and showed the way out of all difficulties\nby simplehearted example, despising rules, and putting himself out in\norder to make things clear to a young artist.\n\nHowever, the Academicians feared he would be an unorthodox master for\nyouth, and appointed another in his place.\n\nA long and serious illness thwarted his keen energies. Diderot was\ngiving himself up to outrageous violence against him. If the old\npainter exhibited at the Salon, Diderot fiercely assailed his art; if\nhe did not exhibit, Diderot as bitterly assailed him for his\nnegligences. Above all, he attacked Boucher in that he did not paint\nwhat Diderot would have painted--but could not. \"When he paints\ninfants,\" cries Diderot, \"you will not find one employed in a real act\nof life--studying his lesson, reading, writing, stripping hemp.\"\n\nPoor unfortunate infants! for whom Philosophy could find no happier\njoy in life than stripping hemp! Boucher was but an artist. He\npainted his generation as far as he could see it, and, with all his\nfaults and weaknesses, he never debauched his art with foreign and\nalien things that had no part in the nation's life; he painted fair\nFrance into his landscapes, not a make-believe land he did not know\nwith preposterous Greek ruins; and best of all, to his eternal honour,\nhe painted infants glad in their gladness to be alive, with no desire\nto send their happy little bodies to school, with no sickly ambition\nto make them into budding philosophers, with no thought of making them\npose and lie as Men of Feeling. He had no joy in setting their little\nbodies to toil--in making them \"teach a lesson to the spectator,\" in\nmaking them stoop their little shoulders to the \"picking of hemp.\"\n\nHe continued to paint as he had always painted--except that he painted\nless well. The wreath of roses was wilting on a grey head. The blood\njigged less warmly in the frail body. The features showed pallid--the\neyes haggard. The sight failed. The hand alone kept something of its\ncunning.\n\nHe went to Holland with his friend Randon du Boisset, but health\nshrank farther from him. Diderot had near spent his last jibe.\n\nIn 1768, Boucher's sixty-fifth year, the neglected queen went to her\ngrave. The king's grief and contrition and vows to amend his life came\ntoo late, and lasted little longer than the drying of the floods of\ntears over the body of his dead consort. A year later he was become\nthe creature of a pretty woman of the gutters, whom he caused to be\nmarried to the Count du Barry--the infamously famous Madame du Barry.\n\nBut neither the remonstrances of Choiseul with the king against this\nfurther degradation of the throne of France, nor his unconcealed scorn\nof the upstart countess, nor the dangerous enemy he made for himself\nthereby, signified now to Boucher, first painter to the king.\n\nBoucher was failing. His son was a prig and a disappointment. His two\nfavourite pupils, Baudoin and Deshayes, who had married his two girls,\ndied.\n\nTo the Salon of 1769 he sent his \"Caravan of Bohemians.\" It was his\nlast display. He had been going about for some time like a gaunt ghost\nof his former self, afflicted with all the ills inevitable to a life\nfeverishly consumed in work and the pursuit of pleasure.\n\nThey went to his studio at five of the clock one May morning, and\nfound him seated at his easel, before a canvas of Venus, dead, with\nthe paint-filled brush fallen out of his fingers.\n\nSo passed he away on the 30th of May 1770, in his sixty-seventh year.\n\nWhen Boucher died, the generation of which he was the limner was near\ncome to its violent end. The rosy carnivals and gay gallantries of his\nage gave way to the blood-stained romance and fierce tempest of the\nRevolution. The garrets of the old curiosity-shops received the\ndiscarded canvases of the master. His shepherds and shepherdesses were\nput to rout by the Romans of his pupil, citizen David. The old order\nwas brought into contempt and overthrown. And with it, Boucher's art,\nlike much that was gracious and charming and good in the evil thing,\nwent down also, and was overwhelmed for a while.\n\nFor a while only. For just as, out of the blood and terror of the\nRevolution, a real France arose, phnix-wise, from the ruin, and in\nbeing born, whilst putting off the vilenesses of the thing from which\nshe sprang, took on also to herself the gracious and winsome qualities\nthat place her amongst the most fascinating peoples of the ages; so\nBoucher has come into his kingdom again--the most gracious of painters\nthat the years have yielded."

                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n        a. One bed, or folding cot,\n        b. One oil stove,\n        c. One lamp,\n        d. Enough supplies of all kinds sufficient for six months,\n        e. Pots, pans, kettles, etc.\nIt is needless to say that positions in Manila and Iloilo were now at\na premium.\n\nWas it possible that teachers were to be sent to places where even the\nnecessaries of life could not be obtained! Was it possible that many\nwould be sent to places so remote that for six months no fresh\nsupplies could be gotten! A mass meeting was held at once, and a\ncommittee was appointed to send a cablegram to the Associated Press\npetitioning aid from the American people at large. Realizing what\nconsternation would be created throughout the United States by such a\nmessage, two of the teachers leaped into a carriage at the close of\nthe meeting and a few moments later were closeted with the chief\nexecutive of the department. As a result the committee was persuaded\nnot to send the cablegram to the Associated Press until by courtesy it\nhad been sent to the President. Of course, this diplomatic move tided\naffairs over and the teachers who had flatly refused to budge from\nManila now agreed to go on to their stations, being assured that\nwhatever action was best would be taken.\n\nThe day had come when we must separate. We were to enter an untried\nand an unknown field. It was fitting that we have a final joyous\nmeeting, so the best orchestra in the archipelago was engaged and we\n\"chased the hours with flying feet\" until dawn so that whatever might\ncome to us in that unknown future upon which we were entering each\nwould hold in pleasant memory our last evening together.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER III. - A DRAMA IN ACTUAL LIFE.\n\n\nAlmost every one heeded the warning to go to his station forearmed\nwith at least necessaries of life, but, as it had never fallen to the\nlot of the writer to cook, he refused to learn at that late day, so he\ntook no pot, no pan, no kettle, putting his future into the hands of\nan uncertain fate and relying upon the unknown hospitality of the\nFilipino.\n\nBacalod, the capital of the province of Occidental Negros, was our\ndestination. The second morning after leaving Manila, we awoke with\nthe \"Kilpatrick\" lying at anchor in a shallow bay. We were several\nmiles from the shore and nothing in sight indicated that we had\nreached a place of any importance. Late the night before we had been\nawakened by the loud, sharp ringing of the ship's bells, accompanied\nby the reversal of the engines and a general disturbance awaking the\ncrew. So our first impressions on coming on deck were that we had run\naground. But the captain assured us that everything was ship-shape and\nthat this was the nearest point of approach to Capiz, a town of\nconsiderable importance on the island of Panay, where a body of troops\nwas to embark for home. Not even the grass hut of a native was in\nsight. Search as we would, not a sign was seen of a stream flowing\ninto the sea, indicating the probable presence of a town. There was\nnot a sign of life of any kind save one lone column of thin, blue\nsmoke that arose from the side of a mountain miles away. One would\nhave thought that we were explorers of three hundred years ago lying\noff the shore of some unknown land.\n\nAfter breakfast the steam launch, together with all the boats, was\nlowered, and several of us who had determined to miss no opportunity\nto gather information about the islands took our places in the launch\nby the side of the ship's mate, and steamed away across the water with\na long line of boats strung out in the rear. We headed away toward a\ngroup of cocoanut trees, and about an hour later stepped ashore on a\npile of decayed coral rocks that extended some twenty or thirty feet\nout into the water, thus forming the only landing place of a town of\nseveral thousands of people and of considerable commercial importance.\n\nA few moments after we had landed, an army wagon drawn by a\nmagnificent pair of mules came up out of a tropical jungle along a\nnarrow road. We clambered into the wagon and were soon lost in the\ndepths of foliage from which we had just seen the vehicle emerge.\n\nLong waving bamboos with their plumy leafage hung over the road from\neach side, meeting and overlapping in the center until they formed an\narchway so dense that the tropical sun now high in the heavens\npenetrated it only at intervals. At times the wagon sank up to the\nhubs in the soft earth, and the muscles of the mules stood out like\nwhip-cords under the skin as they drew us forward.\n\nAt a sharp turn in the road we came upon the first division of troops\nthat was to embark for home. The look of joy upon their sun-browned\nfaces was inexpressible. Their work was done, and with elastic step\nand smiling faces they saluted us as they passed by. The reign of\nforce was at an end; it was going out with them; the reign of peace\nhad begun; it was coming in with us.\n\nIn the afternoon when we returned from the town the last of the troops\nhad arrived and, as we drove up, the bugle was sounding the call to\nsupper. We noticed native women mingling with the troops and, indeed,\na native woman was in constant attention waiting upon one of the\nsoldiers with whom we ate. Her clothes were clean, her hair was nicely\ncombed, and her general appearance was neat. She seemed to anticipate\nthe slightest wish of the soldier with whom she was. She brought him\nwater to drink, cleaned his plate after the meal and saw that his\nknife, fork, and spoon were put into his haversack.\n\nWe had now finished supper and the launch had returned for the last\nload of troops. The lieutenant in command of the company gave the\norder to \"fall in\"; the men shouldered their rifles and fell into\nline. \"Forward, march!\" called the lieutenant, and the column swept\nforward towards the boats. The women had until now restrained\nthemselves, but, as their husbands marched away never to return, their\nfeelings could no longer be restrained. One young woman of about\neighteen, who was leaning against a rock by the roadside sobbing, when\nher husband passed, leaped up in frenzy of passionate love and caught\nthe rifle from his shoulder. Her first impulse seemed to be to throw\nthe gun away, but suddenly realizing the futility of such an act she\nburst into tears, shouldered the rifle herself and marched on by his\nside. Another woman of more mature age threw her arms around the legs\nof a tall stalwart man, and drew him bodily from the line.\n\nBut the troops marched on and entered the boats. One woman who had\nbeen unnoticed before came down into the shallow water and caught hold\nof our last boat as if to prevent its leaving, while others stood\nmingling their sobs with the sounds of the wavelets as they broke on\nthe sands. As we passed away, an expectant mother, standing in bold\noutline against the twilight sky, threw up her hands in an agony of\ndespair and then sank upon the stones. The curtain had fallen upon a\ndrama in actual life deeper in pathos than any other we had ever seen\nor ever expected to see. Depth of passion, depth of love! Who can\nfathom the human heart?\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. - WHAT THE TEACHERS DID.\n\n\nThere is a remarkable sameness about the towns in the Philippines.\n\nThey all have a large open square about the middle of the town, around\nthree sides of which are Chinese stores, unless one side lies open to\nthe sea, and on the fourth is the great stone ecclesia. The streets\nrun at right angles to one another and divide up the town into\ncreditable squares.\n\nEverybody in the Philippines lives up-stairs, for the ground is so\nsoaked with water during the rainy season that it is a menace to\nhealth to live upon the ground floor. So even the poorest nippa hut\nis built upon stakes four or five feet above the ground.\n\nBacalod is a typical Philippine town. As we landed, a broad open\nsquare was spread out before us. Two sides of the square were lined\nwith two-story houses in which were Chinese stores below and Filipino\nhomes above. On the third side stood the great stone church in whose\nmassive tower the clock was striking the hour of four, while the\nfourth lay open to the sea that had borne us thither.\n\nWe landed, but it was in a method new to us and one not usually\nemployed by the traveling public.\n\nWhen our sail boat ran aground on the sandy bottom a hundred yards or\nmore from the shore, a crowd of Filipino men who were on the beach\nslowly rolled up their pantaloons and waded out to the rescue,--for\nthe money that was in it. The boat's crew elevated their trousers'\nlegs also and slided down into the water. Each of us then straddled\nthe neck of a Filipino standing in the water and was held by ankles to\nbe steadied while our biped mounts proceeded to the shore.\n\nWe were now on the ground and face to face with the situation. To give\nthe reader an idea of the actual conditions met by the first teachers\nwho went to the Islands, the following is copied from the instructions\ngiven us in Manila:\n    1. There shall be two sessions daily of all schools, and the\n    last hour of the morning session shall be devoted solely to\n    instructing the Filipino teachers.\n\n    2. In cases where teachers are sent to a town in which there\n    is no school-house, they are expected to secure the aid of the\n    people and have one built.\n\n    3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is\n    stopped.\n\n    4. All supplies must be kept under lock and key. In towns\n    where there is no case or box to lock the supplies in, and it\n    is also impossible to get the town council to furnish a case,\n    a requisition may be sent to Manila, and, if an appropriation\n    can be secured, one will be made and sent out.\n\nThus it can be easily seen that we were indeed pioneers. In many\nplaces no school-house was to be found, and in some cases it was even\ndifficult to get the town council to provide a case in which to keep\nthe supplies.\n\nThe work of the teachers was, in short; to \"make the English language\nthe basis of instruction in the public schools.\" On our arrival at\nBacalod two schools were found in progress, for some soldiers had been\ndetailed for the work here previous to our coming. One of these was\nfor boys and the other, for girls. Thus the work here had been in a\nmeasure simplified, but complications that had arisen at Talisay, one\nof the largest and richest towns on the island, demanded a change of\nteachers and the writer was assigned to the place as superintendent.\n\nHere an attempt had been made to start a school but it had failed\nignominiously and a system of education was to be put into operation\nfrom the very start.\n\nThe Filipinos are not strong advocates of co-education, so separate\nschools were to be started for the boys and the girls. The one for the\nboys was gotten well in hand before the one for the girls was\nattempted at all.\n\nA few days after reaching the town and securing a home the\npresidente of the town had it publicly announced that the following\nMonday morning at eight o'clock a public school for boys would be\nopened in a building that had been rented for the purpose by the\nmunicipal council. About the middle of the afternoon of the same day a\nman beat a little drum throughout all the streets of the town to call\nthe people out and the town clerk announced both in Spanish and in the\nnative language that this public school would begin at the time and\nplace mentioned above; that instruction would be free to all who came;\nthat the government would furnish all supplies; and that instruction\nwould be given in the English language. A native principal and\nassistants were employed and everything was ready to begin.\n\nThe official report of the result is as follows:\n    Boys' public school of Talisay, Negros, P. I., began November\n    4, 1901. Forty-three boys present at eight o'clock. Forty-one\n    of them knew \"good morning\" and \"good afternoon\" but do not\n    know the distinction between them. Two of them speak simple\n    Spanish. At eight forty-five, eight more, who had been\n    attending an early morning private school, came in together.\n\n    The books they brought were so varied and so different from\n    one another that it seemed impossible to bring any reasonable\n    degree of order out of such a chaos, and so, after struggling\n    vainly for about a week with the problem, the superintendent\n    by one fell stroke removed everything in use and put in a\n    uniform system, and from that day on the English language has\n    been the basis of instruction in the public schools of\n    Talisay. The work was of necessity very slow at first, but by\n    the end of a year two schools were going nicely and a number\n    of the brightest boys and girls had made really excellent\n    progress.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER V. - A \"BAILE.\"\n\n\nNot long after the arrival of our party at Bacalod we received an\ninvitation to a \"baile\" given in our honor by the inhabitants of\nSilay, a town some ten or twelve miles up the northern coast and one\nnoted for its social life. The invitation was accepted with pleasure,\nand about the middle of the afternoon on the day appointed we were\nclad in the immaculate white of the tropics and steaming away up the\ncoast on board a launch sent for our conveyance. Twilight was still\nlingering on the path of day when we anchored just off shore at the\ntown. A row-boat containing the officials of the city came out to meet\nus and, in due season, we were ushered into a spacious drawing-room\nfilled almost to overflowing with the \u00e9lite of the town. The \u00e9lite of\ntowns in the Philippines speak Spanish, and, as only one or two of our\nparty could at that time boast of more than a formal acquaintance with\nthe Castilian tongue, the exchange of ideas that evening between us\nand the Filipinos was of necessity not very rapid.\n\nThe necessity of easy communication between us was rendered somewhat\nless indispensable by the announcement of supper as soon as we were\nrested from our trip. When we had taken our places at the table a\nyoung Filipino about twenty-five years of age arose and gave a lengthy\ntoast to the recent union of the Philippines with the United States.\n\nBut as we Americans were unable to scale the dizzy heights of his\nclimaxes or sink to the depths of his pathos, we forewent the\npleasures of his oratory and turned our attention to the savory odor\nof lamb, chicken, and roast pig that came slyly stealing up our\nnostrils to send us nerve dispatches about the gastronomic delights of\nour not far distant future.\n\nAt last the toast was ended and the world-wide soup ushered in a long\ntrain of things good to eat, served in a style better fitted to the\ndelights of the appetite than to the formalities of dinners, for, as\nsoon as the pleasant task of one dish was completed by any one, the\nnext was served him at once regardless of the progress made by the\nothers at the table.\n\nThe last course was dulce. The new-comers to the Philippines will\nnot be long in making the acquaintance of this dish, and at all\nmeetings, both public and private, where eatables are served, it\nperforms an important part. It is anything sweet, and it may vary all\nthe way from an india-rubber-like black mixture of cocoanut milk and\ndirty sugar to a really toothsome and respectable confection. No\nmatter of what materials a dish is composed, just so long as it is\nsweet, it is dulce.\n\nAfter paying our respects to this last course, we arose from the table\nand entered a great rectangular room from the center of whose ceiling\nhung a large glass chandelier, a mass of shimmering crystals. In the\nchairs around the room were the wealth, the youth, and the beauty of\nthe town.\n\nThe first and also the last number of every Filipino dance of any\nformality is the \"rigodon.\" The dancers are arranged in a square, or\nquadrangle according to the number participating, and are then led\nthrough a tangled maze of figures that so utterly bewilders the novice\nthat he sinks into his chair at the end of the dance wondering how it\nall came to pass.\n\nWe Americans breathed a sigh of relief when the \"rigodon\" ended, and\nmustered fresh courage for social conquests in the waltz that was now\nbreathing forth from the trembling strings. My companion in the first\ndance had been the young lady by whose side I had sat at dinner. But\nit now became necessary to search for another, so I prudently waited\nto see how partners were chosen, and made no mistake when a few\nmoments later I faced one of the most luscious looking se\u00f1oritas on\nthe opposite side of the room and offered her my arm. My eyes must\nhave told the story that my lips could not utter in Spanish, for she\nsmiled upon me sweetly, arose, and put her hand upon my shoulder. My\narm encircled her waist and I began to waltz. Unfortunately my\ncompanion did not follow, but began to hop up and down in a manner\nmost distressing. Supposing the attack to be only temporary, I paused\nand, much to my relief, she soon showed signs of recovery; and in the\ncourse of time she came to a standstill looking up into my face in an\ninquiring sort of way, apparently wondering why St. Vitus had not paid\nhis respects to me also. A second attempt to follow the music met with\nresults similar to the first, and during the third attempt, which\nseemed to be trembling on the verge of a failure, St. Vitus let go my\ncompanion and seized me with such vigor that she, who was small even\nfor a Filipino, was gathered up bodily and taken around the room at\nsuch a pace that her toes touched the floor only at far distant\nintervals.\n\nAt this point my devotion to the shrine of Terpsichore ceased from\nforce of circumstances and I seated myself in one of the most\ncomfortable chairs in sight that I might carry out a previously formed\nplan to study the Filipino somewhat critically as he appears in\nsociety.\n\nThe first thing that impressed me as the dancers passed up and down\nthe room was the flash of diamonds. Nearly every woman in the room had\non a brooch that flashed the colors of the rainbow at every turn.\n\nAlmost all of them wore one or more rings that showed up brilliantly\nunder the chandelier. Many of the men too, especially the young men,\nwore gems that appeared to be exquisite. A closer inspection showed\nthat some of the gems had flaws and others were of a poor color, but\nno one would have denied that, taken as a whole, it was a really\nbeautiful display.\n\nThe dress of the ladies was richly colored. Many of their skirts were\nof silk covered with hand embroidered flowers, and their filmy pina\nwaists and broad collar pieces were rich with needle-work. They all\nwore a kind of heelless velvet slipper, very common as a dress shoe in\nthe Philippines, or high-heeled patent leather shoes with neatly\nfitting black stockings.\n\nThe men were dressed in white coats and white pantaloons or black\ncoats and white pantaloons. White shirts and collars, together with\nall sorts and styles of cravats and low-cut patent leather shoes with\nhighly colored socks completed their dress.\n\nIt was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money;\nthat they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a\ntable loaded with good things was a fact to which all of us were\nenthusiastic witnesses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VI. - A SKETCH OF LIFE IN THE PHILIPPINES.\n\n\nHouse-keeping in the Philippines presents some interesting phases. Our\nclub of American officials decided to run a mess, so we employed a\ncook and a house boy, then each of us provided himself with a personal\nservant, making a total of six servants for four men--it takes about\nthis proportion of servants to live in any sort of comfort in the\nPhilippines--and launched ourselves boldly upon the sea of domestic\neconomy. But there were shoals ahead of us, for the question of\nregulating servants is one of no small importance in the Philippines,\nand one of its most disadvantageous features is the long chain of\ndependents that usually attends it.\n\nWe gave the cooks so much a day with which to buy supplies in the\nlocal market, for our own table, making him render a daily list of\nexpenditures, and a fixed amount besides to purchase rice and fish for\nhimself and the other servants. Of course, if they wished to vary\ntheir diet and get chicken and fresh pork, which could be had at far\ndistant intervals, it was wholly a matter of their option, but the\nallowance was made on the basis of so much rice and fish a day for\neach. This allowance was about fifteen cents a day in Spanish coin per\nservant.\n\nThus far all was well. We had agreed to give the cook eight dollars a\nmonth in Spanish money, thinking that good wages would procure good\nservice, but the visions of affluence that floated before him on such\nfloods of wealth were so alluring that they drew him from the kitchen\nto the cooler veranda. In less than a week he had employed an\nassistant at four dollars a month; in less than another week that\nassistant had employed him an assistant at two dollars a month; in\nless than another week that assistant to the assistant had employed\nhim an assistant at the princely salary of fifty cents a month; and\nfrom fear that the chain of dependents would end only by our having\nthe whole Filipino race attached to our culinary force, we broke up\nhouse-keeping and went boarding again, choosing that as the less of\nthe two evils.\n\nOur house furnishings were almost wholly Philippine. The table ware\nand the food on the table came from the ends of the earth. The knives\nand forks were made in Germany, the plates were manufactured in\nEngland, the glass ware and table cloth, in the United States. The\noatmeal and flour came from the United States also. The butter came\nfrom Australia, the rice from China, the salt from Russia, and the\nother eatables from sources about as various as their separate names.\n\nSwitzerland furnished the condensed milk and Illinois the canned\ncream. Nearly all of the canned fruit bore labels from Spain.\n\nThus it can easily be seen that life in the Philippines, if lived\naccording to American ideals, is dependent upon a highly developed and\nhighly complex commerce. However, the difficulties of transportation\nand the restriction of large stocks of merchandise to Manila and some\nhalf a dozen other towns, make so great a difference between country\nlife and city life that a short comparison of the two will not be out\nof place, and life in Manila may well be taken as being fairly typical\nof the latter.\n\nLife in Manila is pleasant, but expensive. It is pleasant from the\nfact that it is not only the capital but also metropolis of the\narchipelago. Thus the combination of wealth and high official position\nhas given to Manila a society of the highest and most refined type.\n\nThe process of beautifying and improving the city which is constantly\ngoing on bids fair to give us at no distant day a city of which we may\nwell be proud.\n\nBut let him who intends living well in Manila on a small income bid\nfarewell at once to so idylic a dream, for it costs much to live well\nthere. In the city of Manila one can get almost anything he wishes,\nbut it must be paid for at the price it commands. Especially in the\ncase of eatables, this price is by no means small, because to the\nfirst cost of articles must in most cases be added the expense of\ndistant shipment from American, European, or Australian ports, and not\ninfrequently the cost of long refrigeration must also be taken into\nconsideration. But, expensive though it is, it is very pleasant to\nlive there and those who have once enjoyed it often wish again to\nquaff the cup of its delights.\n\nIn strong contrast to this pleasant life is the life of the quiet\nlittle hamlet away in the distant islands. Indeed, the Filipino from\nthe distant town, who by some good fortune has been to Manila, or, by\na coup de main, has studied in one of the Manila colleges, is looked\nup to in a true hero-worshiping attitude by all who either know him or\nhear of his fame. Life in such a place is one long state of harmless\ninactivity. Not a wave of trouble from the great outer world ever\ndisturbs its peaceful repose. One lounges forever in an air of\nindolent ease and extreme aversion to anything approaching what might\nbe called a respectable effort.\n\nOne arises in the morning about the time the sun's first rays silver\nthe top leaves of the cocoanut trees and then stirs around until nine\nor ten o'clock, when it is found expedient to avoid a further exposure\nto the sun. From then until about five o'clock in the afternoon it is\nbest to take things as they come, even though one of those things be a\nFilipino dinner. But then you may have your vehiclo attached to a\nyoung bull with a ring in his nose and go for a drive. If it is the\ndry season you will probably enjoy the drive unless you object to the\nfrequent clouds of dust swept along by the evening wind. If it is in\nthe rainy season your pleasure will depend to a considerable extent\nupon how wet you get; but, whether the season be wet or dry, your\npleasure will be regulated largely by the state of harmony existing\nbetween the driver and the bull.\n\nIn these quiet secluded nooks successive generations of Filipinos are\nborn, reared, grow old and die in an even chain of events broken only\nby the occasional erection of a new grass house on the identical spot\nwhere its predecessors have stood for ages. The son lives in the house\nof his father, cultivates the same few square feet of soil planted in\nedible roots, climbs the same cocoanut trees, follows the same winding\npath down to the stream, pounds rice in the same mortar and with the\nsame stick that his ancestors have used from time unremembered, and,\nin case of illness, curls up on a grass mat in a corner of the room\nuntil he dies or by some good fortune recovers. Beyond this narrow\nhorizon he never looks. So narrow and contracted is the life that the\nlanguages of two towns a few miles apart are so different that one\nwould scarcely recognize them as belonging to the same race of people.\n\nSuch are the two extremes of life in our new far Eastern provinces:\nthe one is active, progressive, and cosmopolitan; the other, inactive,\ndecadent, and narrow; but, whether one enjoys the first or endures the\nsecond, there comes to him after leaving a longing to lounge again in\ntropic airs and listen to the lullaby of the winds among the palms.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VII. - THE FILIPINO AT HOME.\n\n\nAs one enters a Filipino sitting-room for the first time, there is one\nfeature in the arrangement of the furniture that impresses itself upon\nhim at once, and it may be stated without fear of serious\ncontradiction that this same peculiar feature in its arrangement will\ncontinue to face him, as he enters different homes, about as certainly\nas he crosses the threshold.\n\nThe arrangement referred to is that of one large mirror, one settee,\nand some ten or a dozen chairs that appear to have had a certain\norderly affection for one another. The mirror is hung upon one of the\nlarge interior parts of the house about four feet above the floor. The\nwooden houses in the Philippines are built by setting large posts\nupright into the ground, extending into the air from twenty to thirty\nfeet. Cross timbers are fastened to these upright posts about eight or\nten feet above the ground and then not sawed off even with the posts,\nbut allowed to extend beyond them each way. The framework of the house\nis built upon these extending cross timbers, a style of building by\nwhich these large upright posts are left standing out on the inside of\nthe room from one to three feet from the walls. It is on that one of\nthese posts most nearly opposite the door that the mirror always finds\nits place. Immediately beneath the mirror is the settee; and the\nchairs are arranged in two parallel lines facing one another and at\nright angles with the ends of the settee. However odd this arrangement\nmay appear to one when he first enters a Filipino drawing-room, there\nare two things to be said in its favor. In the first place, it places\nyou face to face with the person with whom you are conversing so that\nyou can watch him,--a matter of no small moment in the Philippines. In\nthe next place, it enables you to give one of the young ladies a\nsheep's-eye in the mirror while the others present are left where\nMoses was in our much abused conundrum.\n\nThe size of the residence and the quality of its furnishings depends\nupon the wealth of the owner. But there is so vast a difference\nbetween the mode of life of the highest class and the tao, or lowest\nclass, that it is well to speak of them separately, and the great\nmiddle class of Filipinos can easily be imagined to occupy the\nintervening ground.\n\nThe rich Filipino's house is usually of wood built upon a wall of\nstone or brick from ten to fifteen feet high. The floors are kept\nhighly polished in his hallway, dressing-room, and bed-rooms. There\nare, of course, no fire-places in any of the rooms, but on some\noccasions something is needed to dry the rain-soaked atmosphere, for\neven in the dry season it has been seen to rain for five successive\ndays and nights without the cessation of a moment.\n\nA long chain of dependents is attached to the household of the rich\nFilipino. The master has his special body servant to be present at all\ntimes to do his master's bidding, in short, to be the visible\nmechanism of his master's volition. So, too, the lady of the house has\nher servant woman to do the slightest bidding of her ladyship. Then\nthere is the cook who is almost invariably a man, a house boy or two,\nand the coachman. These functionaries, with their assistants and\nassistants to the assistants, together with a servant or two for the\nexclusive service of the children, complete the economic household.\n\nSuch a family has an abundance of rice and wheat bread, also of\nchicken and fish with occasional fresh beef. They have also a good\ndeal of dulce. They regularly serve wine and frequently serve beer\non their tables.\n\nIn strong contrast with this mode of life is that of the tao. His\ndiet consists almost wholly of rice and small uncleaned fish boiled\ntogether. As a rule knife, fork, plate, and spoon find no place in his\nhousehold. The rice and fish are boiled in a pot and then allowed to\ncool in the same vessel or poured out to cool in a large earthen or\nwooden bowl. Then Mr. Tao together with Mrs. Tao and all the young\nTaos squat on their heels around the mixture and satisfy that\nintangible thing called the appetite. They do not use chop sticks as\nthe Chinese do, but the rice and fish are caught in a hollow formed by\nthe first three fingers of the right hand. The thumb is then placed\nbehind the mass. It is raised up and poised before the mouth, with a\nskill coming from the evolution of ages, when a contraction of the\nmuscles of the thumb throws the mass into the mouth with a skill that\nis marvelous to any but a Filipino. To judge from the most reliable\ninformation, the poorest class do not have an abundance of food,\nalthough it would seem that such a condition of things would be\nwell-nigh impossible. However, in a census of one hundred school\nchildren there were found six boys and four girls who declared that\nthey had never had enough to eat, and the native teacher stated that\nthis was probably true.\n\nThe wide gulf between the tao and the rich man is filled by the\ngreat middle class of Filipinos.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VIII. - VISIT TO A LEPER COLONY.\n\n\nNot far from our town was a leper colony and the first Saturday that\ncould be spared was set aside for a trip to the place. It happened\nthat none of the other Americans were at leisure on this particular\nmorning, but, rather then delay the trip or miss it altogether, the\nwriter, armed with a revolver, started out alone.\n\nThe road had been described so accurately by one who was supposed to\nknow it that it was deemed well-nigh impossible to miss the way. The\nmain highway was followed to the point where the by-path supposed to\nlead to the settlement turned off through some bamboo thickets and a\nlow tropical wood. This path led straight away towards the sea-coast\nwhere the houses of the colony were said to stand in a cocoanut grove\nby the beach.\n\nUpon arriving at the settlement, a very inhospitable reception was\nreceived from a mangy cur that growled and showed a very uninviting\nset of sharp, white teeth behind his snarling lips. The growling of\nthe dog had attracted the attention of an old man who, with age-bent\nback, was pounding rice in a mortar about fifty yards away. He turned\nslowly around and, upon seeing an intruder into the primitive quiet of\nthe place, gave a sharp, far-reaching call. The sound had scarcely\nrung through the grove when from about a dozen of the little grass\nhouses dotted here and there fifteen or twenty men armed with bolos\ncame out and gathered around the old man. A sense of my danger flashed\nupon me. Three miles from town and alone in a tropical jungle, I could\nbe almost instantly overcome by this band of bolo-men, and the only\nreport that would ever reach my people would be that I had\n\"disappeared.\" Of course, attack was by no means certain, but the\npotentiality of the situation was thrilling. A drawn revolver and the\ngleaming of its shining barrel had the effect of stopping the men, who\nseemed to be hesitating as to a course of action, until a somewhat\ndignified retreat was made to an open space in the rear from where a\nless dignified and a more hasty retreat began which did not stop short\nof Bacalod.\n\nEnough had been seen, however, even in this short visit, to give\nconvincing proof that the settlement visited was no colony of lepers;\nso, that afternoon two servant boys being taken as guides and\ninterpreters, another attempt was made to reach the goal desired.\n\nThis attempt was successful, and, after about two hours of walking, a\nlittle cluster of grass huts snugly hidden by the sea-coast came into\nview. As we approached, one would have thought it a gala-day. Some few\nchildren, apparently from six to thirteen years of age, almost wholly\nnude, were romping and playing in the open space around which the huts\nstood, and no one would ever have thought that any cloud so horrible\nas leprosy could hover over a place apparently so happy.\n\nBy the side of the path as we passed was a man and his wife setting\nout potato plants. His hands were so puffed and his fingers so short\nthat he could scarcely use them, but he was working along as best he\ncould. His wife's feet were so swollen and twisted that she walked\nonly with the greatest difficulty. We passed them by and entered the\nopen space above referred to.\n\nThe children now saw us, and those of them who could darted away like\nfrightened rabbits, each to his own burrow. An old man who was sitting\nin the warm afternoon sun on the little bamboo platform before his hut\nwas aroused from his lethargic repose by the scampering away of the\nchildren. He arose, trembling upon his tottering limbs, all drawn and\ntwisted, and hobbled away into his hut.\n\nThe children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at\nthe doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of\nthe settlement. In a few moments we were surrounded by a circle of\nhuman beings at once so repulsive and so pitiable that its graphic\nvividness can never be accurately portrayed.\n\nThe old man referred to above, having put on a pair of snow-white\npantaloons, appeared now at the doorway of his hut, followed a few\nmoments later by his wife who had evidently clothed herself in the\nbest raiment she had. At a call from the old man, all the men, women,\nand children in the settlement came out of their huts and stood in a\nline before us. The old man was spokesman and in his native visayan\ntongue made a heart-rending appeal for aid which we were powerless to\ngive. Attention was called to a leper woman, apparently about\ntwenty-five years of age, whose face had been attacked by the disease\nand whose appearance was truly pathetic. Upon her hip was a child\nabout a year and a half old and, strange to say, the child showed as\nyet no signs whatever of the disease.\n\nWhat an indissoluble enigma is life! Here in a little cluster of grass\nhuts in a secluded nook of a secluded island of an all but secluded\narchipelago was gathered together a little community of wretched\nnatives, driven by their loathsomeness from association with others\neven of the same half-savage race. Yet here, men and women loved and\nwere married, by mutual trust if not by law, and children were born of\nthe union to live forever under the unspeakable horror that\novershadowed the unfortunate parents. Love, hatred, sorrow, and\njoy--every passion that enters into the complex structure of the human\nheart even here, in this scene of sadness and despair, was playing\napparently as freely as where misfortune and disease had never crossed\nthe portals of life.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER IX. - A \"HIKE.\"\n\n\nWe were lounging lazily in our hammocks at Jimamaylan one evening in\nApril. Supper was just ended, and the soldiers in the post were\ncollected in groups here and there spinning yarns to pass away the\ntime, when a Filipino clad only in a loin cloth came down the street\nat a steadily swinging run and stopped in front of the sentry. He\nbrought the announcement that a band of ladrones had just burned a\nsugar mill and were advancing to sack a barrio about fifteen miles\naway.\n\nThe invitation of the commanding officer to go on a \"hike\" was eagerly\naccepted, and, in ten minutes after the message was given, the troops\nwere on the march followed by two adventurous pedagogues.\n\nDarkness was just closing in as we left the town, but a resplendent\ntropic moon soon made the night almost as brilliant as the day. The\ntrail we followed led over rough and rocky country. Sometimes for a\ndistance of a mile or more we passed over barren wastes of volcanic\nslag poured out in anger by some peak whose convulsions have long\nsince ceased. Again we would descend into a tropical jungle from the\ndense foliage of which the ladrones could have leaped at any moment,\nhad they known of our coming, and annihilated our little band. We\nforded rapid streams with the water at our breasts, and halted only\nonce in that rapid march of fifteen miles.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the town we met a man who was standing\nguard against a surprise by the ladrones. Nothing could well have been\nmuch more grotesque and nothing could much better illustrate the\nabsolutely primitive condition of the Filipinos in the interior of the\nislands than the appearance of this guard. A pair of knee pants, a\nconical grass hat, and a hemp shirt formed his entire apparel. A long\nflat wooden shield, a bolo, and a long bamboo spear with a sharp,\nflat, iron point, completed his equipment for battle.\n\nHere stood the first and the twentieth centuries side by side. The\nFilipino who had advanced only a stage beyond the condition of\nprimitive man with his knife, spear, and wooden shield, stood side by\nside with the American soldier, a representative of modern life with\nhis magazine rifle, his canteen, his knapsack,--with every article of\nhis clothing made to give him the highest possible efficiency as the\nunit of a military organization.\n\nA few yards farther on we met another guard equipped similarly to the\nfirst. Upon reaching the town, news had just been received that a\ndetachment of troops from another post had intercepted the ladrones\nand fought a skirmish with them. The ladrones had escaped and we set\nout in pursuit of them on a chase wilder than a Quixotic dream. We\nwound our way into the mountains behind the town, inquiring at every\ngrass hut we passed whether the band of ladrones had passed that way,\nbut only once was even a trace of them found. Then it was learned that\nat a certain place they had separated into groups of three or four and\ngone glimmering through the dream of things that were. This place was\nin a secluded nook of the mountains where in years gone by some\nadventurous Spaniard had erected a primitive water mill to grind his\nsugar-cane. We had now marched about twenty miles and the feet of the\npedagogues were a mass of blisters. They had reached the point where\nthat form of military maneuvering called \"hiking\" ceased to possess\nany alluring charms. So a native was persuaded to come out of his lone\nmountain hut and hitch up his carabao and cart. He was then made to\nget on the carabao's back, while the aforesaid pedagogues lay down on\nthe sugar-cane pulp that had been put into the body of the cart, and\nthe driver was instructed to start for the post we had left hours\nbefore, and not to stop until he got there. Being uncertain but that\nsome of the ladrones would learn of our having left the body of troops\nand would try the metal of our steel, we at first agreed that neither\nof us should go to sleep, but it was later decided that probably the\ndriver had no greater desire to cross the Styx than his passengers had\nand that in case of danger he would awaken us, so both took a revolver\nin each hand, stretched out supinely and went to sleep.\n\nSuch a sleep! The rough jolting of the cart over an almost impassable\nroad was never enough to break the spell of slumber. When we awoke the\nblazing tropic sun was past the midday mark of morning, shining full\ninto our unprotected and well-nigh blistered faces.\n\nA pack of dogs were heralding our approach to a little village at the\nfoot of the mountains where ponies were procured to take us back to\nthe post.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he insists, \"have stood the test of ages; and the plant\nevery where retained its name and credit: and one of our good\nherbarists, who had seen a wonderful case of a swoln spleen, so big, and\nhard as to be felt with terror, brought back to a state of nature by it\"\n\n(p. 37). The greatest portion of Hill's concluding section combines\nadvertisement for the powder medicine he was himself manufacturing at a\nhandsome profit together with a protest against competing apothecaries:\n\"An intelligent person was directed to go to the medicinal herb shops in\nthe several markets, and buy some of this Spleen-wort; the name was\nwritten, and shewn to every one; every shop received his money, and\nalmost every one sold a different plant, under the name of this: but\nwhat is very striking, not one of them the right\" (p. 42).\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis did not cease to be printed after Hill's in\n1766, but continued to issue from the presses into the nineteenth\ncentury. A good example of this is the tome by John Reid, physician to\nthe Finsbury Dispensary in London, Essays on Insanity, Hypochondriasis\nand Other Nervous Affections (1816), which summarizes theories of the\nmalady. A bibliographical study of such works would probably reveal\na larger number of titles in the nineteenth century than in the previous\none, but by this time the nature and definition of hypochondria had\nchanged significantly.\n\nIf John Hill's volume is not an important contribution in the history of\nmedicine, it is a lucid and brief exposition of many of the best ideas\nthat had been thought and written on the hyp, with the exception of his\nuninhibited prescribing of herbal medicines as cure-alls. An\nunderstanding of this disease is essential for readers of neoclassical\nEnglish literature, especially when we reflect upon the fact that some\nof the best literature of the period was composed by writers whom it\nafflicted. It is perhaps not without significance that the greatest poet\nof the Augustan age, Alexander Pope, thought it necessary as he lay on\nhis deathbed in May 1744 to exclaim with his last breath, \"I never was\nhippish in my whole life.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. I. - The NATURE of the DISORDER.\n\n\nTo call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and cruel. It\nis a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by thickened\nand distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver, and other\nparts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick scarce knows\none more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\n\nThe blood is a mixture of many fluids, which, in a state of health, are\nso combined, that the whole passes freely through its appointed vessels;\nbut if by the loss of the thinner parts, the rest becomes too gross to\nbe thus carried through, it will stop where the circulation has least\npower; and having thus stopped it will accumulate; heaping by degrees\nobstruction on obstruction.\n\nHealth and chearfulness, and the quiet exercise of mind, depend upon a\nperfect circulation: is it a wonder then, when this becomes impeded the\nbody looses of its health, and the temper of its sprightliness? to be\notherwise would be the miracle; and he inhumanly insults the afflicted,\nwho calls all this a voluntary frowardness. Its slightest state brings\nwith it sickness, anguish and oppression; and innumerable ills follow\nits advancing steps, unless prevented by timely care; till life itself\ngrows burthensome.\n\nThe disease was common in antient Greece; and her physicians understood\nit, better than those perhaps of later times, in any other country; who\nthough happy in many advantages these fathers of the science could not\nhave, yet want the great assistance of frequent watching it in all its\nstages.\n\nThose venerable writers have delivered its nature, and its cure: in the\nfirst every thing now shews they were right; and what they have said as\nto the latter will be found equally true and certain. This, so far as\npresent experience has confirmed it, and no farther, will be here laid\nbefore the afflicted in a few plain words.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. II. - Persons Subject to it.\n\n\nFatigue of mind, and great exertion of its powers often give birth to\nthis disease; and always tend to encrease it. The finer spirits are\nwasted by the labour of the brain: the Philosopher rises from his study\nmore exhausted than the Peasant leaves his drudgery; without the benefit\nthat he has from exercise. Greatness of mind, and steady virtue;\ndetermined resolution, and manly firmness, when put in action, and\nintent upon their object, all also lead to it: perhaps whatever tends to\nthe ennobling of the soul has equal share in bringing on this weakness\nof the body.\n\nFrom this we may learn easily who are the men most subject to it; the\ngrave and studious, those of a sedate temper and enlarged understanding,\nthe learned and wise, the virtuous and the valiant: those whom it were\nthe interest of the world to wish were free from this and every other\nillness; and who perhaps, except for this alloy, would have too large a\nportion of human happiness.\n\nThough these are most, it is not these alone, who are subject to it.\n\nThere are countries where it is endemial, and in other places some have\nthe seeds of it in their constitution; and in some it takes rise from\naccidents. In these last it is the easiest of cure; and in the first\nmost difficult.\n\nBeside the Greeks already named, the Jews of old time were heavily\nafflicted with this disease; and in their descendants to this day it is\noften constitutional: the Spaniards have it almost to a man; and so have\nthe American Indians. Perhaps the character of these several nations may\nbe connected with it. The steady honour, and firm valour of the\nSpaniard, very like that of the ancient Doric nation, who followed the\nflute not the trumpet to the field; and met the enemy, not with shouts\nand fury, but with a determined virtue: it is the temper of the\nHypochondriac to be slow, but unmoveably resolved: the Jew has shewn\nthis mistakenly, but almost miraculously; and the poor Indian, untaught\nas he is, faces all peril with composure, and sings his death-song with\nan unalter'd countenance.\n\nAmong particular persons the most inquiring and contemplative are those\nwho suffer oftenest by this disease; and of all degrees of men I think\nthe clergy. I do not mean the hunting, shooting, drinking clergy, who\nbear the tables of the great; but the retir'd and conscientious; such as\nattend in midnight silence to their duty; and seek in their own cool\nbreasts, or wheresoever else they may be found, new admonitions for an\nage plunged in new vices. To this disease we owe the irreparable loss of\nDr. YOUNG; and the present danger of many other the best and most\nimproved amongst us. May what is here to be proposed assist in their\npreservation!\n\nThe Geometrician or the learned Philosopher of whatever denomination,\nwhose course of study fixes his eye for ever on one object, his mind\nintensely and continually employed upon one thought, should be warned\nalso that he is in danger; or if he find himself already afflicted, he\nshould be told that the same course of life, which brought it on, will,\nwithout due care, encrease it to the most dreaded violence.\n\nThe middle period of life is that in which there is the greatest danger\nof an attack from this disease; and the latter end of autumn, when the\nsummer heats have a little time been over, is the season when in our\nclimate its first assaults are most to be expected. The same time of the\nyear always increases the disorder in those who have been before\nafflicted with it; and it is a truth must be confessed, that from its\nfirst attack the patient grows continually, though slowly, worse; unless\na careful regimen prevent it.\n\nThe constitutions most liable to this obstruction are the lean, and dark\ncomplexioned; the grave and sedentary. Let such watch the first\nsymptoms; and obviate, (as they may with ease) that which it will be\nmuch more difficult to remove.\n\nIt is happy a disease, wherein the patient must do a great deal for\nhimself, falls, for the most part, upon those who have the powers of\nreason strongest. Let them only be aware of this, that the distemper\nnaturally disposes them to inactivity; and reason will have no use\nunless accompanied with resolution to enforce it.\n\nThough the physician can do something toward the cure, much more depends\nupon the patient; and here his constancy of mind will be employed most\nhappily. No one is better qualified to judge on a fair hearing what\ncourse is the most fit; and having made that choice, he must with\npatience wait its good effects. Diseases that come on slowly must have\ntime for curing; an attention to the first appearances of the disorder\nwill be always happiest; because when least established it is easiest\noverthrown: but when that happy period has been neglected, he must wait\nthe effects of such a course as will dilute and melt the obstructing\nmatter gradually; for till that be done it is not only vain, but\nsometimes dangerous, to attempt its expulsion from the body.\n\nThe blood easily separates itself into the grosser and the thinner\nparts: we see this in bleeding; and from the toughness of the red cake\nmay guess how very difficult it will be to dissolve a substance of like\nfirmness in the vessels of the body. That it can thus become thickened\nwithin the body, a Pleurisy shews us too evidently: in that case it is\nbrought on suddenly, and with inflammation; in this other, slowly and\nwithout; and here, even before it forms the obstruction, can bring on\nmany mischiefs. Various causes can produce the same effect, but that in\nall cases operates most durably, which operates most slowly. The watery\npart of the blood is its mild part; in the remaining gross matter of it,\nare acrid salts and burning oils, and these, when destitute of that\nhappy dilution nature gives them in a healthy body, are capable of doing\ngreat mischief to the tender vessels in which they are kept stagnant.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. III. - The SYMPTOMS of the DISORDER.\n\n\nThe first and lightest of the signs that shew this illness are a lowness\nof spirits, and inaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love\nof solitude and a habit of thinking, even on trifling subjects, with too\nmuch steadiness. A very little help may combat these: but if that\nindolence which is indeed a part of the disorder, will neglect them;\nworse must be expected soon to follow.\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness, weight, and oppression in the body,\na want of appetite, or, what is worse, an appetite without digestion;\nfor these are the conditions of different states of the disease, a\nfullness and a difficulty of breathing after meals, a straitness of the\nbreast, pains and flatulencies in the bowels, and an unaptness to\ndischarge their contents.\n\nThe pulse becomes low, weak, and unequal; and there are frequent\npalpitations of the heart, a little dark-coloured urine is voided at\nsome times; and a flood of colourless and insipid at others; relieving\nfor a moment, but increasing the distemper: there is in some cases also\na continual teazing cough, with a choaking stoppage in the throat at\ntimes; then heartburn, sickness, hardness of the belly, and a costive\nhabit, or a tormenting and vain irritation.\n\nThe lips turn pale, the eyes loose their brightness and by degrees the\nwhite grows as it were greenish, the gums want their due firmness, with\ntheir proper colour; and an unpleasing foulness grows upon the teeth:\nthe inside of the mouth is pale and furred, and the throat dry and\nhusky: the colour of the skin is pale (though there are periods when the\nface is florid) and as the obstruction gathers ground, and more affects\nthe liver, the whole body becomes yellow, tawny, greenish, and at length\nof that deep and dusky hue, to which men of swift imagination have given\nthe name of blackness.\n\nThese symptoms do not all appear in any one period of the disease, or in\none case, but at one time or other all of them, as well as those which\nfollow: the flesh becomes cold to the touch, though the patient does not\nhimself perceive it; the limbs grow numbed and torpid, the breathing\ndull and slow, and the voice hollow; and usually the appetite in this\nperiod declines, and comes almost to nothing: night sweats come on,\nblack swellings appear on the veins, the flesh wastes and the breast\nbecomes flat and hollow: the mouth is full of a thin spittle, the head\nis dizzy and confus'd, and sometimes there is an unconquerable numbness\nin the organs of speech.\n\nI have known the temporary silence that follows upon this last symptom\nbecome a jest to the common herd; and the unhappy patient, instead of\ncompassion and assistance, receive the reproof of sullenness, from those\nwho should have known and acted better.\n\nAbout twenty years ago I met on a visit at Catthorpe in Leicestershire a\nyoung gentleman of distinguished learning and abilities, who at certain\ntimes was speechless. The vulgar thought it a pretence: and a jocose\nlady, where he was at tea with company, putting him as she said to a\ntrial, poured out a dish very strong and without sugar. He drank it and\nreturned the cup with a bow of great reserve, and his eye bent on the\nground: she then filled the cup with sugar, and pouring weak tea on it,\nsent it him: he drank that too, looked at her steadily, and blushed for\nher. The lady declared the man was dumb; the rest thought him perverse,\nand obstinate; but a constant and steady perseverance in an easy method\ncured him.\n\nAll these are miseries which the disease, while it retains its natural\nform, can bring upon the patient; and thus he will in time be worn out,\nand led miserably, though slowly, to the grave. Let him not indulge his\ninactivity so far as to give way to this, because it is represented as\nfar off; the disease may suddenly and frightfully change its nature; and\nswifter evils follow.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. IV. - The DANGER.\n\n\nWe have done with the obstruction considered in itself; but this, though\noften unsurmountable by art, at least by the methods now in use, will be\nsometimes broken through at once by nature, or by accidents; and bring\non fatal evils. These are strictly different diseases, and are no\notherway concerned here, than as the consequences of that of which we\nare treating.\n\nThe thick and glutinous blood which has so long stagnated in the spleen,\nwill have in that time altered its nature, and acquired a very great\ndegree of acrimony: while it lies dormant, this does no more mischiefs,\nthan those named already; but when violent exercise, a fit of outrageous\nanger, or any thing else that suddenly shocks and disturbs the frame,\nputs it in motion, it melts at once into a kind of liquid putrefaction.\n\nBeing now thin, it mixes itself readily with the blood again, and brings\non putrid fevers; destroys the substance of the spleen itself, or being\nthrown upon some other of the viscera, corrodes them, and leads on this\nway a swift and miserable death. If it fall upon the liver, its tender\npulpy substance is soon destroyed, jaundices beyond the help of art\nfirst follow, then dropsies and all their train of misery; if on lungs,\nconsumptions; if on the brain, convulsions, epilepsy, palsy, apoplexy;\nif on the surface, leprosy.\n\nThe intention of cure is to melt this coagulation softly, not to break\nit violently; and then to give it a very gentle passage through the\nbowels. There is no safe way for it to take but that; and even that when\nurged too far may bring on fatal dysenteries.\n\nLet none wonder at the sudden devastation which sometimes arises from\nthis long stagnant matter, when liquified too hastily: how long, how\nmany years the impacted matter will continue quiet in a schirrous tumour\nof the breast; but being once put in motion, whether from accident, or\nin the course of nature, what can describe; or what can stop its\nhavock!\n\nInstances of the other are too frequent. A nobleman the other day died\nparalytick: dissection shewed a spleen consumed by an abscess, formed\nfrom the dissolved matter of such an obstruction: and 'tis scarce longer\nsince, a learned gentleman, who had been several years lost to his\nfriends, by the extreams of a Hypochondriacal disorder, seem'd gradually\nwithout assistance to recover: but the lungs suffered while the spleen\nwas freed; and he died very soon of what is called a galloping\nconsumption.\n\nWhen the obstruction is great and of long continuance, if it be thus\nhastily moved, the consequence is, equally, a sudden and a miserable\ndeath, whether, like the matter of a cancer, it remains in its place; or\nlike that of a bad small pox, be thrown upon some other vital part.\n\nLet not the patient be too much alarmed; this is laid down to caution,\nnot to terrify him: it is fit he should know his danger, and attend to\nit; for the prevention is easy; and the cure, even of the most advanced\nstages, when undertaken by gentle means, is not at all impracticable: to\nassist the physician, let him look into himself, and recollect the\nsource of his complaint. This he may judge of from the following\nnotices.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. V. - The Causes of the HYPOCHONDRIASIS.\n\n\nThe obstruction which forms this disease, may take its origin from\ndifferent accidents: a fever ill cured has often caused it; or the\npiles, which had been used to discharge largely, ceasing; a marshy soil,\npoisoned with stagnant water, has given it to some persons; and altho'\nindolence and inactivity are oftenest at the root, yet it has arisen\nfrom too great exercise.\n\nReal grief has often brought it on; and even love, for sometimes that is\nreal. Study and fixed attention of the mind have been accused before;\nand add to these the stooping posture of the body, which most men use,\nthough none should use it, in writing and in reading. This has\ncontributed too much to it; but of all other things night studies are\nthe most destructive. The steady stillness, and dusky habit of all\nnature in those hours, enforce, encourage, and support that settled\ngloom, which rises from fixt thought; and sinks the body to the grave;\neven while it carries up the mind to heaven. He who would have his lamp\n        At midnight hour\n  Be seen in some high lonely tower,\nwill waste the flame of this unheeded life: and while he labours to\nunsphere the spirit of Plato will let loose his own.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VI. - The Cure of the HYPOCHONDRIASIS.\n\n\nLet him who would escape the mischiefs of an obstructed spleen, avoid\nthe things here named: and let him who suffers from the malady,\nendeavour to remember to which of them it has been owing; for half the\nhope depends upon that knowledge.\n\nNature has sometimes made a cure herself, and we should watch her ways;\nfor art never is so right as when it imitates her: sometimes the\npatient's own resolution has set him free. This is always in his power,\nand at all times will do wonders.\n\nThe bleeding of the piles, from nature's single efforts, has at once\ncured a miserable man; where their cessation was the cause of the\ndisorder. A leprosy has appeared upon the skin, and all the symptoms of\nthe former sickness vanished. This among the Jews happened often: both\ndiseases we know were common among them: and I have here seen something\nvery like it: Water-Dock has thrown out scorbutic eruptions, and all the\nformer symptoms of an Hypochondriacal disorder have disappeared:\nreturning indeed when these were unadvisedly struck in; but keeping off\nentirely when they were better treated. A natural purging unsuppressed\nhas sometimes done the same good office: but this is hazardous.\n\nIt is easy to be directed from such instances; only let us take the\nwhole along with us. Bleeding would have answered nature's purpose, if\nshe could not have opened of herself the h\u00e6morrhoidal vessels; but he\nwho should give medicines for that purpose, might destroy his patient by\ntoo great disturbance. If a natural looseness may perform the cure, so\nmay an artificial; when the original source of the disorder points that\nway. But these are helps that take place only in particular cases.\n\nThe general and universal method of cure must be by some mild and gently\nresolving medicine, under the influence of which the obstructing matter\nmay be voided that, or some other way with safety. The best season to\nundertake this is the autumn, but even here there must be caution.\n\nIn the first place, no strong evacuating remedy must be given; for that,\nby carrying off the thinner parts of the juices, will tend to thicken\nthe remainder; and certainly encrease the distemper. No acrid medicine\nmust be directed, for that may act too hastily, dissolve the impacted\nmatter at once, and let it loose, to the destruction of the sufferer; no\nantimonial, no mercurial, no martial preparation must be taken; in\nshort, no chymistry: nature is the shop that heaven has set before us,\nand we must seek our medicine there. The venerable ancients, who knew\nnot this new art, will lead us in the search; and (faithful relators as\nthey are of truth) will tell us whence we may deduce our hope; and what\nwe are to fear.\n\nBut prior to the course of any medicine, and as an essential to any good\nhope from it, the patient must prescribe himself a proper course of\nlife, and a well chosen diet: let us assist him in his choice; and speak\nof this first, as it comes first in order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VI. - Rules of Life for Hypochondriac Persons.\n\n\nAir and exercise, as they are the best preservers of health, and\ngreatest assistants in the cure of all long continued diseases, will\nhave their full effect in this; but there requires some caution in the\nchoice, and management of them. It is common to think the air of high\ngrounds best; but experience near home shews otherwise: the\nHypochondriac patient is always worse at Highgate even than in London.\n\nThe air he breathes should be temperate; not exposed to the utmost\nviolences of heat and cold, and the swift changes from one to the\nother; which are most felt on those high grounds. The side of a hill is\nthe best place for him: and though wet grounds are hurtful; yet let\nthere be the shade of trees, to tempt him often to a walk; and soften by\ntheir exhalation the over dryness of the air.\n\nThe exercise he takes should be frequent; but not violent. Motion\npreserves the firmness of the parts, and elasticity of the vessels; it\nprevents that aggregation of thick humours which he is most to fear. A\nsedentary life always produces weakness, and that mischief always\nfollows: weak eyes are gummy, weak lungs are clogged with phlegm, and\nweak bowels waste themselves in vapid diarrhoeas.\n\nLet him invite himself abroad, and let his friends invite him by every\ninnocent inducement. For me, I should advise above all other things the\nstudy of nature. Let him begin with plants: he will here find a\ncontinual pleasure, and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful\nthings; even of the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to\nwalk; and every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket,\nwill afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually\nin the air, and continually to change the nature and quality of the air,\nby visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the lawn, the\nheath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be abroad; and the\nunceasing variety of the subjects of his observation, will prevent his\nwalking hastily: he will pursue his studies in the air; and that\ncontemplative turn of mind, which in his closet threatened his\ndestruction, will thus become the great means of his recovery.\n\nIf the mind tire upon this, from the repeated use, another of nature's\nkingdoms opens itself at once upon him; the plant he is weary of\nobserving, feeds some insect he may examine; nor is there a stone that\nlies before his foot, but may afford instruction and amusement.\n\nEven what the vulgar call the most abject things will shew a wonderful\nutility; and lead the mind, in pious contemplation higher than the\nstars. The poorest moss that is trampled under foot, has its important\nuses: is it at the bottom of a wood we find it? why there it shelters\nthe fallen seeds; hides them from birds, and covers them from frost;\nand thus becomes the foster father of another forest! creeps it along\nthe surface of a rock? even there its good is infinite! its small roots\nrun into the stone, and the rains make their way after them; the moss\nhaving lived its time dies; it rots and with the mouldered fragments of\nthe stone forms earth; wherein, after a few successions, useful plants\nmay grow, and feed more useful cattle!\n\nIs there a weed more humble in its aspect, more trampled on, or more\ndespised than knot grass! no art can get the better of its growth, no\nlabour can destroy it; 'twere pity if they could, for the thing lives\nwhere nothing would of use to us; and its large and most wonderfully\nabundant seeds, feed in hard winters, half the birds of Heaven.\n\nWhat the weak moss performs upon the rock the loathed toadstool brings\nabout in timber: is an oak dead where man's eye will not find it? this\nfungus roots itself upon the bark, and rots the wood beneath it; hither\nthe beetle creeps for shelter, and for sustenance; him the woodpecker\nfollows as his prey; and while he tears the tree in search of him, he\nscatters it about the ground; which it manures.\n\nNor is it the beetle alone that thus insinuates itself into the\nsubstance of the vegetable tribe: the tender aphide, whom a touch\ndestroys, burrows between the two skins of a leaf, for shelter from his\nwinged enemies; tracing, with more than Dedal\u00e6an art, his various\nmeanders; and veining the green surface with these white lines more\nbeautifully than the best \u00c6gyptian marble.\n\n'Twere endless to proceed; nor is it needful: one object will not fail\nto lead on to another, and every where the goodness of his God will\nshine before him even in what are thought the vilest things; his\ngreatness in the lead of them.\n\nLet him pursue these thoughts, and seek abroad the objects and the\ninstigations to them: but let him in these and all other excursions\navoid equally the dews of early morning, and of evening.\n\nThe more than usual exercise of this prescription will dispose him to\nmore than customary sleep, let him indulge it freely; so far from\nhurting, it will help his cure.\n\nLet him avoid all excesses: drink need scarce be named, for we are\nwriting to men of better and of nobler minds, than can be tempted to\nthat humiliating vice. Those who in this disorder have too great an\nappetite, must not indulge it; much eaten was never well digested: but\nof all excesses the most fatal in this case is that of venery. It is the\nexcess we speak of.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VII. - The proper DIET.\n\n\nIn the first place acids must be avoided carefully; and all things that\nare in a state of fermentation, for they will breed acidity. Provisions\nhardened by salting never should be tasted; much less those cured by\nsmoaking, and by salting. Bacon is indigestible in an Hypochondriac\nstomach; and hams, impregnated as is now the custom, with acid fumes\nfrom the wood fires over which they are hung, have that additional\nmischief.\n\nMilk ought to be a great article in the diet: and even in this there\nshould be choice. The milk of grass-fed cows has its true quality: no\nother. There are a multitude of ways in which this may be made a part\nboth of our foods and drinks, and they should all be used.\n\nThe great and general caution is that the diet be at all times of a kind\nloosening and gently stimulating; light but not acrid. Veal, lamb,\nfowls, lobsters, crabs, craw-fish, fresh water fish and mutton broth,\nwith plenty of boiled vegetables, are always right; and give enough\nvariety.\n\nRaw vegetables are all bad: sour wines, old cheese, and bottled beer are\nthings never to be once tasted. Indeed much wine is wrong, be it of what\nkind soever. It is the first of cordials; and as such I would have it\ntaken in this disease when it is wanted: plainly as a medicine, rather\nthan a part of diet. Malt liquor carefully chosen is certainly the best\ndrink. This must be neither new, nor tending to sourness; perfectly\nclear, and of a moderate strength: it is the native liquor of our\ncountry, and the most healthful.\n\nToo much tea weakens; and even sugar is in this disorder hurtful: but\nhoney may supply its place in most things; and this is not only harmless\nbut medicinal; a very powerful dissolvent of impacted humours, and a\ngreat deobstruent.\n\nWhat wine is drank should be of some of the sweet kinds. Old Hock has\nbeen found on enquiry to yield more than ten times the acid of the sweet\nwines; and in red Port, at least in what we are content to call so,\nthere is an astringent quality, that is most mischievous in these cases:\nit is said there is often alum in it: how pregnant with mischief that\nmust be to persons whose bowels require to be kept open, is most\nevident. Summer fruits perfectly ripe are not only harmless but\nmedicinal; but if eaten unripe they will be very prejudicial. A light\nsupper, which will leave an appetite for a milk breakfast, is always\nright; this will not let the stomach be ravenous for dinner, as it is\napt to be in those who make that their only meal.\n\nOne caution more must be given, and it may seem a strange one: it is\nthat the patient attend regularly to his hours of eating. We have to do\nwith men for the most part whose soul is the great object of their\nregard; but let them not forget they have a body.\n\nThe late Dr. STUKELY has told me, that one day by appointment visiting\nSir ISAAC NEWTON, the servant told him, he was in his study. No one was\npermitted to disturb him there; but as it was near dinner time, the\nvisitor sat down to wait for him. After a time dinner was brought in; a\nboil'd chicken under a cover. An hour pass'd, and Sir ISAAC did not\nappear. The doctor eat the fowl, and covering up the empty dish, bad\nthem dress their master another. Before that was ready, the great man\ncame down; he apologiz'd for his delay, and added, \"give me but leave to\ntake my short dinner, and I shall be at your service; I am fatigued and\nfaint.\" Saying this, he lifted up the cover; and without any emotion,\nturned about to STUKELY with a smile; \"See says he, what we studious\npeople are, I forgot I had din'd.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VIII. - The MEDICINE.\n\n\n'Tis the ill fate of this disease, more than of all others to be\nmisunderstood at first, and thence neglected; till the physician shakes\nhis head at a few first questions. None steals so fatally upon the\nsufferer: its advances are by very slow degrees; but every day it grows\nmore difficult of cure.\n\nThat this obstruction in the spleen is the true malady, the cases\nrelated by the antients, present observation, and the unerring\ntestimonies of dissections leave no room to doubt. Being understood, the\npath is open where to seek a remedy: and our best guides in this, as in\nthe former instance, will be those venerable Greeks; who saw a thousand\nof these cases, where we see one; and with less than half our theory,\ncured twice as many patients.\n\nOne established doctrine holds place in all these writers; that whatever\nby a hasty fermentation dissolves the impacted matter of the\nobstruction, and sends it in that state into the blood, does incredible\nmischief: but that whatever medicine softens it by slow degrees, and, as\nit melts, delivers it to the bowels without disturbance; will cure with\nequal certainty and safety.\n\nFor this good purpose, they knew and tried a multitude of herbs; but in\nthe end they fixed on one: and on their repeated trials of this, they\nbanished all the rest. This stood alone for the cure of the disease; and\nfrom its virtue received the name of SPLEEN-WORT. O wise and happy\nGreeks! authors of knowledge and perpetuators of it! With them the very\nname they gave a plant declared its virtues: with us, a writer calls a\nplant from some friend; that the good gardener who receives the honour,\nmay call another by his name who gave it. We now add the term smooth\nto this herb, to distinguish it from another, called by the same general\nterm, though not much resembling it.\n\nThe virtues of this smooth Spleen-wort have flood the test of ages; and\nthe plant every where retained its name and credit: and one of our good\nherbalists, who had seen a wonderful case of a swoln spleen, so big, and\nhard as to be felt with terror, brought back to a state of nature by it;\nand all the miserable symptoms vanish; thought Spleen-wort not enough\nexpressive of its excellence; but stamp'd on it the name of MILT-WASTE.\n\nIn the Greek Islands now, the use of it is known to every one; and even\nthe lazy monks who take it, are no longer splenetic. In the west of\nEngland, the rocks are stripped of it with diligence; and every old woman\ntells you how charming that leaf is for bookish men: in Russia they use\na plant of this kind in their malt liquor: it came into fashion there\nfor the cure of this disease; which from its constant use is scarce\nknown any longer; and they suppose 'tis added to their liquor for a\nflavour.\n\nThe ancients held it in a kind of veneration; and used what has been\ncalled a superstition in the gathering it. It was to be taken up with a\nsharp knife, without violence, and laid upon the clean linen: no time\nbut the still darkness of the night was proper, and even the moon was\nnot to shine upon it. I know they have been ridiculed for this; for\nnothing is so vain as learned ignorance: but let me be permitted once to\nvindicate them.\n\nThe plant has leaves that can close in their sides; and their under part\nis covered thick with a yellow powder, consisting of the seeds, and seed\nvessels: in these they knew the virtue most resided: this was the golden\ndust they held so valuable; and this they knew they could not be too\ncautious to preserve. They were not ignorant of the sleep of plants; a\nmatter lately spoken of by some, as if a new discovery; and being\nsensible that light, a dry air, an expanded leaf, and a tempestuous\nseason, were the means of losing this fine dust; and knowing also that\ndarkness alone brought on that closing of the leaf which thence has\nbeen called sleep; and which helped to defend and to secure it, they\ntherefore took such time, and used such means as could best preserve the\nplant entire; and even save what might be scattered from it.--And now\nwhere is their superstition?\n\nFrom this plant thus collected they prepared a medicine, which in a\ncourse of forty days scarce ever failed to make a perfect cure.\n\nWe have the plant wild with us; and till the fashion of rough chemical\npreparations took off our attention from these gentler remedies, it was\nin frequent use and great repute. I trust it will be so again: and many\nthank me for restoring it to notice.\n\nSpleen-wort gives out its virtues freely in a tincture; and a small dose\nof this, mixing readily with the blood and juices, gradually dissolves\nthe obstruction; and by a little at a time delivers its contents to be\nthrown off without pain, from the bowels. Let this be done while the\nviscera are yet sound and the cure is perfect. More than the forty days\nof the Greek method is scarce ever required; much oftener two thirds of\nthat time suffice; and every day, from the first dose of it, the patient\nfeels the happy change that is growing in his constitution. His food no\nmore turns putrid on his stomach, but yields its healthful nourishment.\n\nThe swelling after meals therefore vanishes; and with that goes the\nlowness, and anxiety, the difficult breath, and the distracting cholick:\nhe can bear the approach of rainy weather without pain; he finds himself\nmore apt for motion, and ready to take that exercise which is to be\nassistant in his cure; life seems no longer burthensome. His bowels get\ninto the natural condition of health, and perform their office once at\nleast a day; better if a little more: the dull and dead colour of his\nskin goes off, his lips grow red again, and every sign of health\nreturns.\n\nLet him who takes the medicine, say whether any thing here be\nexaggerated. Let him, if he pleases to give himself the trouble, talk\nover with me, or write to me, this gradual decrease of his complaints,\nas he proceeds in his cure. My uncertain state of health does not\npermit me to practise physic in the usual way, but I am very desirous to\ndo what good I can, and shall never refuse my advice, such as it may be,\nto any person rich or poor, in whatever manner he may apply for it. I\nshall refer him to no apothecary, whose bills require he should be\ndrenched with potions; but tell him, in this as in all other cases,\nwhere to find some simple herb; which he may if he please prepare\nhimself; or if he had rather spare that trouble, may have it so prepared\nfrom me.\n\nWith regard to Spleen-wort, no method of using it is more effectual than\nsimply taking it in powder; the only advantage of a tincture, is that a\nproper dose may be given, and yet the stomach not be loaded with so\nlarge a quantity: it is an easier and pleasanter method, and nothing\nmore.\n\nIf any person choose to take it in the other way, I should still wish\nhim once at least to apply to me; that he may be assured what he is\nabout to take is the right plant. Abuses in medicines are at this time\nvery great, and in no instance worse than what relates to herbs. The\nbest of our physicians have complained upon this head with warmth, but\nwithout redress: they know the virtues and the value of many of our\nnative plants, but dread to prescribe them; lest some wrong thing should\nbe administered in their place; perhaps inefficacious, perhaps\nmischievous, nay it may be fatal. The few simple things I direct are\nalways before me; and it will at all times be a pleasure to me, in this\nand any other instance, to see whether what any person is about to take\nbe right. I have great obligations to the public, and this is the best\nreturn that I know how to make.\n\nTo see the need of such a caution, hear a transaction but of yesterday!\n\nAn intelligent person was directed to go to the medicinal herb shops in\nthe several markets, and buy some of this Spleen-wort; the name was\nwritten, and shewn to every one; every shop received his money, and\nalmost every one sold a different plant, under the name of this: but\nwhat is very striking, not one of them the right. Such is the chance of\nhealth in those hands through which the best means of it usually pass;\neven in the most regular course of application.\n\nI would not be understood to limit the little services I may this way be\nable to render the afflicted, to this single instance; much less to\npropose to myself any advantages from it. Whoever pleases will be\nwelcome to me, upon any such occasion; and whatever be the herb on which\nhe places a dependance, he shall be shewn it growing. I once recommended\na garden to be established for this use, at the public expence: one\ngreat person has put it in my power to answer all its purposes.\n\n                        F  I  N  I  S.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris, he was\n\"nominated\" to the Academy. He had but to present an Historical\nPainting in order to take his seat as an Academician.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VENUS AND MARRIAGE\n\n\nBack in his beloved Paris again; thrilled by the atmosphere and gaiety\nof its merry life; in the full vigour of manhood on the eve of his\nthirties; amongst congenial friends; done with the drudgery of winning\nto Academic honour, Boucher saw that the public were not falling over\neach other to purchase religious or historic pictures; he straightway\nturned his back upon these things, and on the edge of his thirtieth\nyear he gave to the world his \"Marriage of the Children of God with\nthe Children of Men,\" in which Venus is the avowed mistress of his\nadoration. It caused a fine stir, and greatly increased his repute.\n\nIn this picture he ends his Italian period and strikes his own\npersonal note. Both this and the \"Venus asking arms for Aeneas from\nVulcan,\" together with the \"Birth of Adonis\" and the \"Death of\nAdonis,\" of about the same period, still show Boucher strongly under\nthe influence of his master, Lemoyne. Indeed, the \"Birth\" and \"Death\nof Adonis,\" their record lost during the scuffle and confusion of the\nRevolution, for long hung side by side as pictures by Lemoyne, until,\nbeing cleaned about 1860, Boucher's initials were discovered upon\nthem, and, contemporary engravings being hunted up, still further\nproved their origin. But in the Venus that now figures in all his\nworks there is that flesh-painting of the nude, and that rosy touch\nupon the flesh of the female figure, that are a far more certain\nsignature of Boucher's handiwork than any written name.\n\nUnfortunately the Salons were closed during Boucher's earlier years\nuntil he was thirty-four, and the record of his work during these\nyears is difficult to follow; but with his service to Venus his\npersonal career begins, and the stream of his Venus-pieces steadily\nflows from his hands.\n\nHe came to her service rid of all prentice essays in craftsmanship, a\nfinished and consummate artist. He found in his subject a goddess to\nwhom he could devote his great and splendid gifts. He painted her\ndainty body with a radiant delight and a rare colour-sense such as\nFrance had never before seen or uttered. He remains to this day the\nfirst painter of the subtle, delicate, and elusive thing that is\nfemininity; he caught her allure, her charm, as he was to catch the\nfragrance and charm of children and flowers; and he set the statement\nof these things upon canvas as they have never been uttered.\n\nThe whole of his life long, Boucher gave himself up with equal and\npassionate devotion to work and to pleasure--working at his easel\noften twelve hours of his day without losing, to the end when the\nbrush fell from his dead fingers, his blitheness of heart or his\ngenerosity of act, and without weakening the pleasure-loving desires\nof his gadding spirit. Out of his splendid toil he made the means to\nindulge his tastes for pleasure; and the gratifying of his tastes in\nturn renewed and created the ideas that made the subjects of his\nartistry. He brought to all he did a joy in the doing that made of his\nvast labour one long pleasure--of his pleasures a riot of industry. He\nplayed as he toiled, scarce knowing which was play and which toil.\n\nThe gossip of his love-affairs makes no romantic story--they were but\ncommonplace ecstasies with unknown frail women. But hard as he worked\nand lived and played, he found time to get himself married in his\nthirtieth year to pretty seventeen-year-old Marie Jeanne Buseau, a\nlittle Parisian--and for love of her, so far as he understood the\nbusiness; for she brought him no dowry.\n\nThe young couple settled down for the next ten years in the Rue\nSaint-Thomas-du-Louvre. Here Boucher lived through his thirties.\n\nMadame was a pretty creature, if we had but Latour's pastel portrait\nalone to prove it. But the pretty features were the crown to as pretty\na body, for she sat often to her lord; and it is clear from his\ncorrespondence with a friend, Bachaumont, that she is the Psyche of\nhis illustrated fable--and Psyche runs much to the Altogether.\n\nMarriage, however, was not likely to imprison Boucher's gadding eyes;\nand it did not. Madame Boucher seems to have had as frail a heart, and\navoided strife by amusing herself, amongst others, with the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who, to gain access to the lady,\ncommissioned Boucher to do the Watteau-like illustrations to\nAcajou--a dull affair. Boucher's pretty wife, herself no mean\nartist, worked in his studio, and painted several smaller canvases\nafter his pictures, gaining some fame as a miniaturist and engraver.\n\nNor did Marriage turn Boucher from his art. Two years were gone by\nsince his nomination to the Academy; he had now to paint the formal\nHistorical Picture and present it in order to take his seat as\nAcademician; and it was in this his thirtieth year that he painted and\nwon his academic rank with the \"Renauld et Armide\" now at the Louvre.\n\nHere he sufficiently subordinated his own style to the academic to\nensure success; and the work was hailed by Academicians and critics,\nincluding Diderot, with enthusiasm. But even here we have his cupids\npeeping round the mythologic event; and Armide herself has pretty\nFrench lips that knew no Greek.\n\nOnce secure of his position, he straightway flung the last remnants of\nthe academic style out of his studio door; and it is a grim comment on\ncriticism that it was just exactly in proportion as he developed his\nown personal genius and uttered the France of his day, that he was\nattacked; whilst the stilted things that he knew were third-rate, and\nwhich he wholly rejected from henceforth, were exactly the things that\nwere praised!\n\nHis election to the Academy, and the enthusiasm over the picture that\nwon him his seat thereat, brought his name before the young king; the\nfollowing year he received his first order from the Court whose\npainter he was destined to become. The decorations in the queen's\napartments were gloomy and had grown black; and he painted in their\nstead the \"Charity,\" \"Abundance,\" \"Fidelity,\" and \"Prudence\" still\nthere to be seen. Indeed, with his gay vision, his pretty habit of\nculling only the flowers from the garden of life, and his quickness to\nset down the pleasing thing in every prospect, Boucher was the\ndestined painter of a Court weary of pomposity and the pose of the\nmock-heroic, and which was wholly giving itself up to pleasure and the\nelegances.\n\nBut neither his new dignity of Academician nor the royal favour, kept\nhim from the bookshops; and he illustrated, with rare beauty and a\ncharm worthy of Watteau, the great edition of the Works of Moli\u00e8re\nin his thirty-first year. It is true that he made as free with\nMoli\u00e8re's world as with the Gods of Olympus; he peoples the plays with\ncharacters of his own day, arrayed in the dress and habit of that day,\nand moving in surroundings that he saw about him.\n\n\nLE MONDE QUI S'AMUSE\n\n\nThe Homely had come upon the town out of Holland, painted with most\nconsummate artistry by Chardin, and was soon in the vogue. Boucher had\na quick eye for the mode. And he straightway set himself to the\npainting of \"La Belle Cuisini\u00e8re.\" Still-life and homely subjects need\nan accuracy of realism and a Dutch sense of these things, a sense of\nsincerity and an appreciation of the dignity of the work-a-day life of\nthe people, in which Boucher was wholly lacking. Above all, it calls\nfor a sense of \"character,\" which, in Boucher, was always weak. It was\na sneer against him that his very broomsticks called for pompons and\nribbons--and there was more than a little truth in the spite. He is\nmore concerned with the accident of the kissing of a kitchen-maid than\nwith the kitchen's habit. He cannot even peep into a scullery without\ndragging in Venus by the skirts, and tricking her out in a\nproperty-wardrobe of a scullery-wench, in which the girl is clearly\nbut acting the part.\n\nHowever, these passing vogues and experiments in different methods\nwere only gay asides--he was working the while upon his own subjects;\nand, to the display by its several members ordered by the Academy, he\nsent four little paintings of fauns and cupids which won him the\nhonour of election as deputy-professor. His brain and hand were very\nbusy, and he turns from one thing to another with amazing facility,\nbringing distinction to all that he does.\n\nBut he painted about this time two pictures of infants, \"L'Amour\nOiseleur\" and \"L'Amour Moissonneur,\" which were the beginning of that\nhost of cupids that he let fly from his studio; they frolic across his\ncanvases and join the retinue of Venus, peeping out from clouds, over\nwaves, round curtains, painted with a perfection that has never been\nsurpassed in the portrayal of infants. He painted their round limbs,\ntheir lusty life, their delightful awkwardnesses, their jolly fat\ngrace, their na\u00efve surprise at life and glory in it, as they had never\nbeen painted before, and have never been painted since.\n\nHe also gave forth in this his thirty-third year a \"Pastoral\" and a\n\"Shepherd and Shepherdess in Conversation,\" with sheep about them and\nin a pleasant landscape, which were his first essays in the style that\nhe created and which made him famous.\n\nHis friend Meissonnier, the inventor of the rococo, stood godfather to\nBoucher's first-born son in the May of 1736.\n\nFrom the very beginning Boucher seems to have been engraved. And these\nengravings, done by the best gravers of his day, greatly extended his\nreputation and popularised him; he fully realised the value of the\nadvertisement as well as his profits from it. Before his thirty-third\nyear was run out he published his well-known \"Cries of Paris.\"\n\nBoucher's description of them, \"studies from the low classes,\" holds\nthe key to that something of failure to realise the dramatic verities\nthat is over all; it gives also the attitude of the France that he\nknew towards the France that he did not, and could not understand. He\ncreated that dainty, pleasant atmosphere that comes floating up to the\nwindows on a fresh morning in Paris from the musical cries of\nthe street vendors; but of the deeper significance of the\nstreet-sellers--of the miserable accent in their life, of their weary\ntoil, of the dignity of their labour--he knew nothing; his brush could\nnot refrain from making elegance and fine manners peep from behind the\nstreet-porter's fustian or the milkmaid's skirt.\n\nBut his thirty-third year was to contain a more far-reaching\nsignificance even than the creation of his cupid-pieces and pastorals.\n\nThe \"Cries of Paris\" were scarce printed when Boucher's illustration\nto \"Don Quixote\" appeared--\"Sancho pursued by the servants of the\nDuke.\" This design was to have far-reaching results that Boucher\nlittle suspected.\n\nThe painter Oudry had been called to the conduct of the great tapestry\nlooms at Beauvais a couple of years before; and in his efforts to\nfurnish the looms with good designs, he now called Boucher to his aid,\nwhose original and fresh style, colour, and arrangement, together with\nhis personal vision, and the enthusiasm and zeal with which he threw\nhimself into the work, at once increased the reputation and the\nproducts of the famous looms. This large designing for the tapestries\nwas, in return, of immense value to the development of the genius of\nthe man, enlarging his breadth of style and giving scope to that great\ndecorative sense that was his superb gift. Thenceforth he was destined\nto play a supreme part in the history of the world-famed factories. He\nnow produced painting after painting for the Beauvais looms.\n\nLife is now one long triumph for Boucher, only disturbed in this year\nby the sad news of the suicide of his old master, Lemoyne. It was in\nthis, Boucher's thirty-fourth year, that the Salon was opened for the\nfirst time since Boucher's infancy, and he contributed several\ncanvases to it.\n\nRigaud, the old Academician, now close upon eighty, straggling through\nthe great galleries, might well blink and gasp at the change that had\ncome over French art since he last exhibited there, thirty-three years\ngone by; but his scoffs and regrets held no terrors for the younger\nAcademicians gathered about. He stood in a new world. A new generation\nwas in possession. The grand manner, the severe etiquette, formal\nmock-heroics, and solemn pomposity of Louis the Fourteenth were\nvanished, and the Agreeable and the Pleasant Make-Believe of Louis the\nFifteenth reigned in their stead. Old Rigaud might blink indeed! Just\nas the imposing and stilted etiquette of the reception-room had given\nplace to the easy manners and airy etiquette of the dainty boudoir, so\nhad light chatter and gay wit and the quick repartee usurped the heavy\nsplendours of a consequential age. France, weary of an eternal pose of\nthe grand manner, was seeking change in joyousness and amusement.\n\nGallantry and gaiety were become the object of the ambition of a\ndandified and elegant day. France became a coquette; dressed herself\nas a porcelain shepherdess; and with beribboned crook and sheep,\nseeking pleasant prospects to stroll through, gave herself to\ndalliance--her powder-puff and patch-box and fan a serious part of her\nunseriousness.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE CH\u00c2TEAUROUX\n\n\nAt thirty-five Boucher has arrived. He is in the vogue; in favour at\nCourt--as well as in the fashion. In his three years from taking his\nseat at the Academy to the opening of the first Salon he has created a\nnew and original style--his cupid pieces, his pastorals, his\nVenus-pieces, his tapestry. Boucher's kingdom lay in the realm of the\ndecorative painter--and he has found it. Torn from the surroundings\nfor which he designed them, as part and parcel of the general scheme,\nhis pictures are as out of place as an Italian altarpiece in an\nEnglish dining-room, yet they suffer less. Several may still be seen,\nas he set them up in frames of his own planning, as overdoors in the\npalace of the Soubise, now given up to the national archives.\n\nThe ghost of the Prince of Soubise, who commissioned them, may haunt\nhis palace, but his kin know the place no longer. The overdoors\nwrought by Boucher's skill look down now on the nation's collection of\nhistoric documents. The \"Three Graces enchaining Love,\" the fine\npastoral of \"The Cage,\" and the pastoral of the \"Shepherd placing a\nRose in his Shepherdess's Hair,\" were to see a mightier change than\nthe usurpation of Louis the Fourteenth's pompous age by the elegant\nyears of Louis the Fifteenth. But this was not as yet. Here at least\nwe see Boucher's art rid of all outside influences, and at the full\ntide of creation; here we have the inimitable lightness of touch, the\nfigures and landscape bathed in the airy volume of atmosphere.\n\nHe seems at this time to have played with pastel, due probably to his\nfriendship with Latour, who sent a portrait of Boucher's wife to this\nSalon. Boucher showed in the use of chalks the artistry and skill that\nwere always at his command.\n\nHe also was putting to its full use his innate sense of landscape,\nraising to high achievement that astonishing balance of landscape and\nfigures in his design--a balance that has never been surpassed; his\nfigures never override his landscape; his landscape never overpowers\nhis figures. His earnest counsels to his pupils and his constant\ndeploring of the lack of the landscape art in France prove the great\nstress he laid upon it.\n\nThe designing of a frontispiece for the catalogue of a personal\nfriend, one Gersaint, a merchant of oriental wares, started Boucher in\nhis thirty-third year upon that series of Chinese pictures and\ntapestries known as the \"Chinoiseries,\" in which he frittered away\nonly too many precious hours, for they were received with great favour\nby the public. The paintings of Chinese subjects designed for the\nlooms of Beauvais are still to be seen at Besan\u00e7on.\n\nBut busy as were his brain and hand in the exercise of his wide and\nversatile gifts, pouring out \"Chinoiseries,\" illustrations for books,\ntapestries on a large scale, landscapes, models for the gilt bronze\ndecorations of porcelain vases, scheming handsome frames for his\npictures, designing furniture and fans--Boucher was true, above all,\n\"to his goddess,\" and painted the famed \"Birth of Venus,\" which,\nthanks to the Swedish Ambassador's fondness for Madame Boucher, now\nhangs at Stockholm; our amorous Count de Tessin, to be just, seems to\nhave had a rare flair for the artistic--besides artist's wives. It was\non the 15th of April in 1742, the last year of his thirties, that the\nRoyal favour was marked by the grant of a pension of 400 livres\n(double florins) to Boucher with promise of early benefits to follow.\n\nTwo years afterwards it was raised to 600 livres.\n\nThis was the year that he painted the beautiful canvas of \"Diana\nleaving the Bath with one of her Companions,\" now at the Louvre. It\nwas also the year that saw his landscape, the \"Hamlet of Iss\u00e9\" at the\nSalon. This \"Hameau d'Iss\u00e9\" was to be enlarged for the Opera, proving\nhim to be decorator there, where he was arranging waterfalls,\ncascades, and the rest of the pretty business, without staying his\nhand from his art.\n\nAt forty Boucher has come into his kingdom. The ten years of these\nforties were to be a vast triumph for him. He was to produce\nmasterpiece after masterpiece. His art had caught the taste of the\nday. He was at the height of his powers. He had done great things--he\nwas to do greater. During these ten years of his forties he poured\nforth vivid and glowing works of sustained power and originality.\n\nWe have a picture of him as he was in the flesh at this time--the\npastel portrait by Lundberg, now at the Louvre--a gay, somewhat\ndissipated, handsomely dressed dandy of the time, smiling out of his\ncareless day, the debonnair man of fashion, the laughing eyes showing\nsigns of the night carousals, which were the rest from the prodigious\ntoil of this vital and forthright spirit.\n\nIt was in this our artist's fortieth year that the gifted old Cardinal\nFleury, who had guided the fortunes of France with rare skill, died,\nbroken by his ninety years and the blunders of the disastrous war that\nhe had so strenuously opposed; and Louis, essaying the strut of\nkingship, became king by act. His indolent character, unequal to the\nmighty business, his indeterminate will fretted by the set of\nquarrelling and intriguing rogues that he gathered about him as his\nministers, he fell into the habit that became his thenceforth, the\nonly thing to which he paid the tribute of constancy--he ruled France\nfrom behind pretty petticoats. He had early shown the adulterous blood\nof his great-grandfather; two, if not three, of five sisters of the\nnoble and historic house of De Nesle had yielded to his gadding fancy;\nthe youngest now ousted her sister De Mailly from the king's favour,\nwas publicly acknowledged as the king's mistress, and became Duchess\nof Ch\u00e2teauroux. Boucher painted her handsome being as a shepherdess in\none of his pastorals. She was no ordinary toy of a king. A woman of\ntalent, with hot ambitions for the king's majesty, fired with the\npride of race of the old French noblesse, it was during her short\nyears of ascendancy over the king that he roused from his body's\ntorpor and made an effort to reach the dignity and eminence befitting\nto the lord of a great and gallant people. He stepped forth awhile\nfrom his drunken bouts and manifold mean adulteries, and set himself\nat the head of the army in Flanders, and strutted it as conqueror.\n\nPoor Ch\u00e2teauroux only got the hate of the people for reward, Louis the\nhonours; for the people resented the public dishonour of her state.\n\nPower she found to be a dead-sea apple in her pretty mouth. The glory\nof it all, the splendours, were not the easily won delights for which\nshe had looked. She had to fight a duel, that never ended, with the\nking's witty, crafty, and scurrilous Prime Minister, the notorious\nMaurepas--and Maurepas willed that no woman should ever come between\nhim and the king--Maurepas who knew no mercy, no decency, no chivalry,\nno scruple. At Ch\u00e2teauroux's urging, Louis placed himself at the\nhead of the army; and France went near mad with joy that she had\nagain found a king. Crafty Maurepas urged on the business; the\nCh\u00e2teauroux suddenly realised his cunning glee--it separated her from\nthe king.\n\nOut of the whirl of things Boucher's fortune was ripening, little as\nhe might suspect it.\n\nHe was painting masterpieces that make his name live. To his fortieth\nyear belong the famed \"Birth of Venus,\" the \"Venus leaving the Bath,\"\nthe \"Muse Clio,\" the \"Muse Melpomene,\" and the three well-known\npastorals now at the Louvre--\"The Sleeping Shepherdess,\" the \"Nest,\"\n\n\nand the \"Shepherd and Shepherdesses.\" Of the many famous Venus-pieces\nthat his hand painted during these years it is not easy to write the\nlist. But having signed the \"Marriage of Love and Psyche\" at\nforty-one, he turned his experimental hand to the homely, realistic\nDutch style that was having a wide vogue, and painted the\n\"Dejeuner\"--a family of the prosperous class of the day at\nbreakfast--showing with rare charm the surroundings and home life of\nthe well-to-do of his time.\n\nAll goes well with Boucher. He changes into better quarters in the Rue\nde Grenelle-Saint-Honor\u00e9, where he lived for the next five years,\nuntil 1749; but his eyes are fixed upon a studio and apartments at\nthe old palace of the Louvre, though the hard intriguing of his\npowerful friends at Court on his behalf failed for some time. He had,\nindeed, to make another move before he arrived at his longed-for goal.\n\nPensions Boucher, like others, had found to be somewhat empty affairs;\nbut rooms at the Louvre were a solid possession eagerly sought after\nby the artists.\n\nIn this year of 1744 Boucher created a new fashion at the annual Salon\nby sending studies and sketches instead of finished pictures; and it\nset a value upon such things not before realised by artists, for\nsuccess was instant and loud.\n\nTowards the end of the next, Boucher's forty-second year, the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who was to take his leave of Paris,\ncommissioned four pictures to represent the day of a woman of fashion,\nand to be entitled \"Morning,\" \"Midday,\" \"Evening,\" and \"Night.\"\n\nBoucher painted one of these for him, now known as the \"Marchande de\nModes.\" The others were painted later, and all had a wide vogue as\nengravings. The correspondence has interest since it reveals Boucher's\nbusiness habits; he was paid for a picture on its delivery, and for\neach of these he was to receive 600 livres (double florins or\ndollars)--about a hundred and twenty pounds.\n\nIn an official document of the Director of Buildings to the king (or\nMinister of Fine Art, as we should say), written in this year of 1745,\nBoucher being forty-two, is a \"list of the best painters,\" in which\nBoucher is singled out for distinction as \"an historic painter, living\nin the Rue de Grenelle-Saint-Honor\u00e9, opposite the Rue des Deux-Ecus,\npupil of Lemoyne, excelling also in landscape, grotesques, and\nornaments in the manner of Watteau; and equally skilled in painting\nflowers, fruit, architecture, and subjects of gallantry and of\nfashion.\"\n\nNot so bad for dry officialdom; the critics could learn a lesson. For\nhe was nothing less. What indeed does he not do? and wondrous well!\nthis painter of the age.\n\nAnd the mighty rush of events is about to sweep him into further\nprominence; the very things which he probably passed by with a gay\nshrug are to enrich him, to help him to his highest fulfilment.\n\nPoor Ch\u00e2teauroux saw that she must lose the king's gadding favour in\nthe conflict with Maurepas unless she joined her lord, now with the\narmy. She realised full well that she had created the new Louis of\nAmbition--that her going must bring the people's hate to her. But she\ndared not lose the king. And she went. Maurepas had overdone his\njibings. The indiscretion at once rang through the land; became the\njest of the army--and Maurepas was not far from the bottom of the\nbusiness. The discreet indiscretion of covered ways between the king's\nlodgings and hers only added to the mockeries, and increased the\npeople's hate against, of course, the Ch\u00e2teauroux. Then upon a day in\nAugust the small-pox seized Louis at Metz; poor Ch\u00e2teauroux fought for\npossession of the king in the sick room, until his fear of\ndeath--Louis' sole piety--sent her packing--shrinking back in the\nhired carriage at each halting-place for change of horses, lest she\nshould be seen and torn from her place and destroyed by the populace.\n\nBut Louis recovered; Paris rang with bells at joy on his recovery, and\nhe entered the city amidst mad enthusiasm, hailed as The Well-Beloved.\n\nHe sent for the Ch\u00e2teauroux to find her dying, Maurepas having to\ndeliver the message of recall. She died suddenly and in great agony,\nswearing that Maurepas had poisoned her--died in the arms of her poor\ndiscarded sister, the De Mailly.\n\nBut this year of 1745 Boucher hears a mightier scandal that is to mean\nvast things to all France--and not least of all to Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE POMPADOUR\n\n\nA young bride had become the gossip of the rich merchant society of\nParis--that class that was ousting the old noblesse from power. She\nwas a beautiful, a remarkable woman; her wit was repeated in the\ndrawing-rooms, she had all the accomplishments; her charming\nname--Madame Lenormant d'Etioles.\n\nDraw aside the curtains of the past and we discover our little Jeanne\nPoisson--grown into this exquisite creature. It has come about in\nstrange fashion enough. The father--a scandalous fellow--having\nfingered the commissariat moneys in ugly ways to his own use, had been\nbanished for the ugly business. Nor is Jeanne's mother any better than\nshe should be; and the wags wink knowingly at the handsome and rich\nman of fashion, Monsieur Lenormant de Tournehem, who has been the\nfavoured gallant during the absence of the light-fingered Poisson.\n\nAnd, of a truth, Lenormant de Tournehem takes astonishing interest in\nthe little Jeanne--watching over her up-growing and giving her the\nbest of education at the convent, where she wins all hearts, and is\nknown as \"the little queen.\" The truth spoken with wondrous prophecy,\nif unthinkingly, as we shall see. Complacent Poisson came home, and\ntook the rich and fashionable, bland and smiling Lenormant de\nTournehem to his arms. Has he not wealth and estates? therefore as\nexcellent a friend for Poisson as for Madame Poisson. The girl Jeanne\nleaves the convent to be taught the accomplishments by the supreme\nmasters of France, the wits foregather at Madame Poisson's, and the\nbrilliant Jeanne is soon mistress of the arts--coquetry not least of\nall; has also the most exquisite taste in dress. Under all is a heart\ncold as steel; calculating as the higher mathematics. She has but one\nhindrance to ambition--her mean birth. Lenormant de Tournehem rids her\neven of this slur by making his nephew, Lenormant d'Etioles, marry\nher, giving the young couple half his fortune for dowry, and the\npromise of the rest when he dies--also he grants him a splendid\ntown-house, as splendid a country seat. And consequential\nself-respecting little Lenormant d'Etioles is lord of Etioles, amongst\nother seignories. So Jane Fish appears as Madame Lenormant d'Etioles,\nseductive, beautiful, accomplished, to whose house repair the new\nphilosophy, the wits, and artists. She has a certain sense of virtue;\nindeed openly vows that no one but the king shall ever come between\nher and her lord. But, deep in her heart, she has harboured a fierce\nambition--that the king shall help her to keep her bond. She puts\nforth all her gifts, all her powers, to win to the strange goal;\nconfides it to her worldly mother and \"uncle,\" Lenormant de Tournehem;\nfinds keen allies therein to the reaching of that strange goal. The\ndeath of the Ch\u00e2teauroux clears the way. At a masked ball the king is\nintrigued as to the personality of a beautiful woman who plagues him\nwith her art; he orders the unmasking. Madame Lenormant d'Etioles\nstands revealed, drops her handkerchief as by accident; the whisper\nruns through the Court that \"the handkerchief has been thrown!\" The\nking stoops and picks it up. A few evenings later she is smuggled into\nthe \"private apartments.\" She goes again a month later; in the morning\nis seized with sudden terror--she daren't go back to her angry lord\nlest he do her grievous harm; he will have missed her. The king is\ntouched; allows her to hide from henceforth in the secret apartments;\npromises the beautiful creature a lodging, her husband's banishment,\nand early acknowledgment as titular mistress--before the whole Court\nat Easter, says the pious Great One. But he has to join the army to\nplay the Conqueror at Fontenoy; and it is later in the year\n(September) before Madame d'Etioles is presented to the Court in a\nvast company and proceeds to the queen's apartments to kiss hands on\nappointment. Thus was Jeanne Poisson raised to the great aristocracy\nof France in her twenty-third year as Marquise de Pompadour.\n\nBoucher had been one of the brilliant group of artists of the\nd'Etioles' circle. That the Pompadour's influence had much effect upon\nhis position at Court for a year or two is unlikely; for she had to\nfight for possession of the king day and night, as the Ch\u00e2teauroux\nhad done, against the queen's party and the unscrupulous enmity of\nMaurepas. To set down Boucher's favour at Court to her is ridiculous.\n\nHe was painting for the queen's apartments at thirty-one when the\nPompadour was a school-girl of twelve. But in the year following her\nrise to power, Boucher painted four pictures for the large room of the\nDauphin, which were \"placed elsewhere\"; and, the year after that, he\nwas at work upon two pictures for the bedroom of the king at the\ncastle of Marly. It is likely enough that the Pompadour directed this\norder. She had almost immediately secured the office of the\nDirector-General of Buildings, which covered the direction of the\nroyal art treasures, for \"uncle\" Lenormant de Tournehem, who was also\na friend of the artist. And from this year it is significant that\nBoucher paints no more for the opposing camp of the Queen and Dauphin.\n\nHe was now giving all his strength to the \"Rape of Europa\" that he\npainted for the competition ordered by the Academy at the command of\nLenormant de Tournehem in the king's name, in which ten chosen\nAcademicians were to paint subjects in their own style for six prizes\nand a gold medal, to be awarded in secret vote by the competing\nartists themselves. Boucher won, by his amiable nature, the good-will\nof them all by proposing that they should so arrange as to share the\nprizes equally, and thus prevent any sense of soreness inevitable in\nthe losers.\n\nBut greatly as he won the good-fellowship of his fellow-artists by it,\nthis picture caused a murmur to rise amongst the critics who,\naforetime loud in his praise, now began to complain of his \"abuse of\nrose tints\" in the painting of the female nude. The fact was that\nDiderot and the men of the New Philosophy were turning their eyes to\nthe whole foundations upon which France was built, art as well as\nsociety, and were beginning to demand of art \"grandeur and morality in\nits subjects.\" They were soon to be clamouring for \"the statement of a\ngreat maxim, a lesson for the spectator.\" Diderot, with bull-like\ncourage, picked out the greatest, and turned upon Boucher, blaming him\nfor triviality.\n\nThe nations, weary of war, concluded the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in\nthe October of 1748. No sooner was peace concluded than Louis\nrelapsed into his old habit of dandified indolence and profligate\nease; and, putting from him his duties as the lord of a great people,\nhe gave himself up to shameless intrigues. He allowed the Pompadour to\nusurp his magnificence and to rule over the land. He yielded himself\nutterly, if sometimes sulkily, to her domination; and for sixteen\nyears she was the most powerful person at Court, the greatest force in\nthe state--making and unmaking ministers, disposing of office,\nhonours, titles, pensions. All political affairs were discussed and\narranged under her guidance; ministers, ambassadors, generals\ntransacted their business in her stately boudoirs; the whole patronage\nof the sovereign was dispensed by her pretty hands; the prizes of the\nChurch, of the army, of the magistracy could be obtained solely\nthrough her favour and good-will. Her energy must have been\nprodigious. Possessed of extraordinary talents and exquisite tastes,\nshe gave full rein to them, and it was in the indulgence of her better\nqualities that Destiny brought Boucher into the friendship of this\nwonderful woman. She became not only his patron but his pupil,\nengraving several of his designs.\n\nBut this, her sovereignty over the king, easy and light in its outward\nseeming, was a haggard nightmare to the calculating woman who had so\nlonged for it. She knew no single hour's rest from the night she won\nto the king's bed. She had to fight her enemies, secret and open, for\npossession of the king's will, day and night; and she fought--with\nrare courage. She won by consummate skill and unending pluck. She made\nherself an essential part of the king's freedom from care. The Court\nparty fought her for power with constant vigilance. Maurepas brought\nall his unscrupulous art, all his ironic mimicry, all his vile jibes\nand unchivalrous hatred to bear against her. He had made himself a\nnecessity to the king; and he never slept away a chance of injuring\nher. He knew no mercy, no nobility, no pity. He made her the detested\nobject of the people. With his own hands he penned the witty verses\nand epigrams that were sung and flung about the streets of Paris.\n\nBut she had an enemy more subtle than any at the Court--hour by hour\nshe had to dispute the king with the king's boredom. And it was in the\neffort to do so that she created her celebrated theatre in the\nprivate apartments, calling Boucher and others to her aid in the doing\nof it. Here the noblest of France vied with each other to obtain the\nsmallest part to play, an instrument in its orchestra, an invitation\nto its performances.\n\nBoucher left the Opera to become its decorator in 1748, and did not\nreturn until her death. For her, he also decorated her beautiful rooms\nat Bellevue. She bought at high prices many of his greatest\nmasterpieces.\n\nThe Pompadour's power so greatly increased that she openly took\ncommand of the king's will; dared and succeeded in getting his\nfavourite Maurepas banished; and herself took to the use of the kingly\n\"we.\" Her rascally father was created Lord of Marigny; her brother,\nwhom the king liked well and called \"little brother,\" was created\nMarquis de Vandi\u00e8res; her only child, Alexandrine, signed her name as\na princess of the blood royal, and would have been married to the\nblood royal had she not caught the small-pox and died. She amassed a\nprivate fortune, castles, and estates such as no mistress had dreamed\nof; and into them she poured art treasures that cost the nation\nthirty-six millions of money. She created the porcelain factory of\nS\u00e8vres, kept keen watch over the Gobelins looms, and founded the great\nMilitary School of St. Cyr amidst work that would have kept several\nstatesmen busy, and of deadly intrigues at Court that would have\nbroken the spirit of many a brilliant man.\n\nIt was in her hectic desire to keep the king from being bored that she\nstooped, and made Boucher stoop, to the employment of his high\nartistry in the painting of a series of indecent pictures wherewith to\ntickle the jaded desires of Boredom, and thereby gave rise to the\nwidespread impression that Boucher's art was ever infected by base\ndesign. But Boucher was, at his very worst, but a healthy animal; and\neven in these secret works for the king he did not reach so low as did\nmany an artist of more pious memory who painted with no excuse but his\nown pleasure.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the Pompadour has been blamed too much for this\nevil act, and too much forgotten for her splendid patronage of the man\nwho, under it and during these great years of his forties, produced a\nseries of masterpieces that place him in the foremost rank of the\npainters of his century. It is impossible to reckon the number of the\npastorals and Venus-pieces that his master-hand painted and loved to\npaint, during these the supreme years of his genius. It is significant\nthat they were painted during the years that saw the Pompadour in\nsupreme power.\n\nBoucher was so firmly established in 1750, his forty-seventh year,\nthat he moved into a new house in the Rue Richelieu, near the Palais\nRoyal. Disappointed in not receiving a studio and apartments at the\nLouvre, he was allowed to use a studio in the king's library. He was\nnow making money so easily that he was able to collect pictures and\nprecious stones and the gaily coloured curiosities that appealed to\nhis tastes.\n\nThe critics were becoming more and more censorious; and one of them\nhits true with the comment that in his pastorals his shepherdesses\nlook as if they had stepped over from the Opera and would soon be off\nagain thereto.\n\nIn his forty-eighth year Boucher's art was at its most luminous\nstage--his atmosphere clear and subtle and exquisitely rendered; his\nyellows golden; his whites satin-like and silvery; his flesh-tones\nupon the nude bodies of his goddesses unsurpassed by previous art. The\nbeauty of it all was not to last much longer.\n\nLenormant de Tournehem died suddenly in the November of 1751; the\nPompadour's brother, Abel Poisson de Vandi\u00e8res, was appointed\nDirector-General in his stead at the age of twenty-five--and soon\nafterwards, on the death of his father, created Marquis de Marigny--a\nshy, handsome youth, a gentleman and an honourable fellow, whom the\nking liked well, and against whom his sister's sole complaint was that\nhe lacked the brazen effrontery of the courtiers of the day. No man\ndid more for the advancement of the art of his time. A pension of a\nthousand livres falling vacant, the young fellow secured it for\nBoucher; and almost immediately afterwards, a studio becoming vacant\nat the Louvre owing to the death of Coypel, first painter to the king,\nBoucher came to his coveted home, eagerly moving in with his family as\nsoon as its wretched state could be put into repair.\n\nThe decoration of the new wing to the palace at Fontainebleau brought\nthe commission for the painting of the ceiling and the principal\npicture in the Council Chamber to Boucher, who had already decorated\nthe Dining-Room. This was the period of his painting the \"Rising\" and\nthe \"Setting of the Sun\" for the Pompadour, now in the Watteau\ncollection, two canvases that were always favourites with the painter,\nbitterly as they were assailed by the critic Grimm.\n\nHe was turning out so much work that it was impossible to give as much\ncare to his pictures as he ought. For he refused sternly, his life\nlong, to raise his prices; by consequence he had to create a larger\namount of work in order to meet his expenditure. It was about this\ntime that Reynolds, passing through Paris, went to visit him and found\nhim painting on a huge canvas without models or sketches. \"On\nexpressing my surprise,\" writes Reynolds, \"he replied that he had\nconsidered the model as necessary during his youth until he had\ncompleted his study of art, but that he had not used one for a long\ntime past.\"\n\nHe soon had not the time, not only to paint from nature but even to\ngive his pictures the work necessary to complete them. The feverish\nhaste which took possession of him in his frantic endeavour to meet\nthe vast demand for his pictures, and the eager efforts of his\nengravers to satisfy the public call for engravings after his works,\ngave him less and less leisure to joy in their doing. And his eyesight\nbegan to fail. His flesh-tints deepened to a reddish hue; and he\nstands baffled before his work, suspecting his sight, since what every\none cries out upon as being bright vermilion, he only sees as a dull\nearthy colour. Boucher has topped the height of his achievement; he\nhas to \"descend the other side of the hill.\" Boucher begins to grow\nold.\n\nIn Boucher's fifty-first year an ugly intrigue of the queen's party at\nCourt to sap the Pompadour's influence over the king by drawing away\nthe king's affections towards Madame de Choiseul-Romanet, a reckless\nyoung beauty of the Court, brought about a strange alliance. The Count\nde Stainville, one of the Pompadour's bitterest enemies, was shown the\nking's letter of invitation to his young kinswoman; and he, deeply\nwounded in his pride that his kinswoman should have been offered to\nthe king, went to the Pompadour and exposed the plot. A close\nalliance followed; and De Stainville thenceforth became her chief\nguide in affairs of state. It was at her instance that the king called\nhim to be his Prime Minister, raising him to the Duchy of Choiseul--a\nname he made illustrious as one of the greatest Ministers of France.\n\nIn his fifty-second year Boucher was appointed to the directorship of\nthe Gobelins looms, to the huge delight of the weavers and all\nconcerned with the tapestry factory. This was the year of his painting\nthe famous portrait of the Pompadour, to whom he several times paid\nthis \"tribute of immorality.\" For the Gobelins looms he produced many\nhandsome designs; and he was painting with astounding industry. But\nhis hand's skill began to falter. His art shows weariness in his\nsixtieth year, and sickness fell upon him, and held him in servitude\nnow with rare moments of respite. The critics, notoriously Diderot,\nwere now attacking him with shameless virulence. Boucher passed it all\nby; but he felt the change that was taking place in the public taste.\n\nThe ideas of the New Philosophy were infecting public opinion; the Man\nof Feeling had arisen in the land; and France, humiliated in war, and\nresenting the follies and the greed of her shameless privileged class,\nwas openly resenting it and all its works. Choiseul had planted his\nstrength deep in the people's party, and was come near to being its\ngod. His masterly mind had checked Frederick of Prussia to the North;\nand the nations, exhausted by the struggle, signed the Peace of Paris\nin 1763. Choiseul, with France at peace abroad, turned to the blotting\nout of the turbulent order of the Jesuits at home. Their attempt to\nend the Pompadour's relations with the king made this powerful woman\neager to complete his design; the chance was soon to come, and the\nOrder was abolished from France and its vast property seized by the\nstate.\n\nThe Pompadour lived but a short while to enjoy her triumph. Worn out\nby her superhuman activities, assailed by debt, she fell ill of a\nracking cough, dying on the 15th of April, 1764, in her forty-second\nyear, keeping her ascendancy over the king and the supreme power in\nFrance to her last hour. Death found her transacting affairs of state.\n\nLouis, weary of his servitude, had only a heartless epigram to cast\nat the body of the dead woman as she passed to her last resting-place.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE END\n\n\nThe death of the Pompadour robbed Boucher of a friend; but her\nbrother, Marigny, remained faithfully attached to the old artist, and\nseized every chance to honour him. On the death of Carle van Loo,\nBoucher, at sixty-two, was made first painter to the king, with all\nhis pensions and privileges that were consistent with this the supreme\nappointment in the art world.\n\nThere had been serious intention of making Boucher the head of the\nEcole des El\u00e8ves Proteg\u00e9s; he had the art of making himself liked and\nof inspiring the love of the arts. He was very popular with the\nstudents and artists, owing to his kindliness, his eagerness to render\nservice, his readiness to encourage the youngsters or to console them.\n\nWhen the riot took place, provoked by the Academicians by their award\nof the Prix de Rome in 1767, the students insulted the Academicians,\nbut hailed Boucher with enthusiastic applause. The reason was not far\nto seek. When a student came to the old master for advice he did not\n\"play the pontiff,\" and, scorning the false dignity of big phrases, he\ntook the brush in his hand and showed the way out of all difficulties\nby simplehearted example, despising rules, and putting himself out in\norder to make things clear to a young artist.\n\nHowever, the Academicians feared he would be an unorthodox master for\nyouth, and appointed another in his place.\n\nA long and serious illness thwarted his keen energies. Diderot was\ngiving himself up to outrageous violence against him. If the old\npainter exhibited at the Salon, Diderot fiercely assailed his art; if\nhe did not exhibit, Diderot as bitterly assailed him for his\nnegligences. Above all, he attacked Boucher in that he did not paint\nwhat Diderot would have painted--but could not. \"When he paints\ninfants,\" cries Diderot, \"you will not find one employed in a real act\nof life--studying his lesson, reading, writing, stripping hemp.\"\n\nPoor unfortunate infants! for whom Philosophy could find no happier\njoy in life than stripping hemp! Boucher was but an artist. He\npainted his generation as far as he could see it, and, with all his\nfaults and weaknesses, he never debauched his art with foreign and\nalien things that had no part in the nation's life; he painted fair\nFrance into his landscapes, not a make-believe land he did not know\nwith preposterous Greek ruins; and best of all, to his eternal honour,\nhe painted infants glad in their gladness to be alive, with no desire\nto send their happy little bodies to school, with no sickly ambition\nto make them into budding philosophers, with no thought of making them\npose and lie as Men of Feeling. He had no joy in setting their little\nbodies to toil--in making them \"teach a lesson to the spectator,\" in\nmaking them stoop their little shoulders to the \"picking of hemp.\"\n\nHe continued to paint as he had always painted--except that he painted\nless well. The wreath of roses was wilting on a grey head. The blood\njigged less warmly in the frail body. The features showed pallid--the\neyes haggard. The sight failed. The hand alone kept something of its\ncunning.\n\nHe went to Holland with his friend Randon du Boisset, but health\nshrank farther from him. Diderot had near spent his last jibe.\n\nIn 1768, Boucher's sixty-fifth year, the neglected queen went to her\ngrave. The king's grief and contrition and vows to amend his life came\ntoo late, and lasted little longer than the drying of the floods of\ntears over the body of his dead consort. A year later he was become\nthe creature of a pretty woman of the gutters, whom he caused to be\nmarried to the Count du Barry--the infamously famous Madame du Barry.\n\nBut neither the remonstrances of Choiseul with the king against this\nfurther degradation of the throne of France, nor his unconcealed scorn\nof the upstart countess, nor the dangerous enemy he made for himself\nthereby, signified now to Boucher, first painter to the king.\n\nBoucher was failing. His son was a prig and a disappointment. His two\nfavourite pupils, Baudoin and Deshayes, who had married his two girls,\ndied.\n\nTo the Salon of 1769 he sent his \"Caravan of Bohemians.\" It was his\nlast display. He had been going about for some time like a gaunt ghost\nof his former self, afflicted with all the ills inevitable to a life\nfeverishly consumed in work and the pursuit of pleasure.\n\nThey went to his studio at five of the clock one May morning, and\nfound him seated at his easel, before a canvas of Venus, dead, with\nthe paint-filled brush fallen out of his fingers.\n\nSo passed he away on the 30th of May 1770, in his sixty-seventh year.\n\nWhen Boucher died, the generation of which he was the limner was near\ncome to its violent end. The rosy carnivals and gay gallantries of his\nage gave way to the blood-stained romance and fierce tempest of the\nRevolution. The garrets of the old curiosity-shops received the\ndiscarded canvases of the master. His shepherds and shepherdesses were\nput to rout by the Romans of his pupil, citizen David. The old order\nwas brought into contempt and overthrown. And with it, Boucher's art,\nlike much that was gracious and charming and good in the evil thing,\nwent down also, and was overwhelmed for a while.\n\nFor a while only. For just as, out of the blood and terror of the\nRevolution, a real France arose, phnix-wise, from the ruin, and in\nbeing born, whilst putting off the vilenesses of the thing from which\nshe sprang, took on also to herself the gracious and winsome qualities\nthat place her amongst the most fascinating peoples of the ages; so\nBoucher has come into his kingdom again--the most gracious of painters\nthat the years have yielded."

                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n        a. One bed, or folding cot,\n        b. One oil stove,\n        c. One lamp,\n        d. Enough supplies of all kinds sufficient for six months,\n        e. Pots, pans, kettles, etc.\nIt is needless to say that positions in Manila and Iloilo were now at\na premium.\n\nWas it possible that teachers were to be sent to places where even the\nnecessaries of life could not be obtained! Was it possible that many\nwould be sent to places so remote that for six months no fresh\nsupplies could be gotten! A mass meeting was held at once, and a\ncommittee was appointed to send a cablegram to the Associated Press\npetitioning aid from the American people at large. Realizing what\nconsternation would be created throughout the United States by such a\nmessage, two of the teachers leaped into a carriage at the close of\nthe meeting and a few moments later were closeted with the chief\nexecutive of the department. As a result the committee was persuaded\nnot to send the cablegram to the Associated Press until by courtesy it\nhad been sent to the President. Of course, this diplomatic move tided\naffairs over and the teachers who had flatly refused to budge from\nManila now agreed to go on to their stations, being assured that\nwhatever action was best would be taken.\n\nThe day had come when we must separate. We were to enter an untried\nand an unknown field. It was fitting that we have a final joyous\nmeeting, so the best orchestra in the archipelago was engaged and we\n\"chased the hours with flying feet\" until dawn so that whatever might\ncome to us in that unknown future upon which we were entering each\nwould hold in pleasant memory our last evening together.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER III. - A DRAMA IN ACTUAL LIFE.\n\n\nAlmost every one heeded the warning to go to his station forearmed\nwith at least necessaries of life, but, as it had never fallen to the\nlot of the writer to cook, he refused to learn at that late day, so he\ntook no pot, no pan, no kettle, putting his future into the hands of\nan uncertain fate and relying upon the unknown hospitality of the\nFilipino.\n\nBacalod, the capital of the province of Occidental Negros, was our\ndestination. The second morning after leaving Manila, we awoke with\nthe \"Kilpatrick\" lying at anchor in a shallow bay. We were several\nmiles from the shore and nothing in sight indicated that we had\nreached a place of any importance. Late the night before we had been\nawakened by the loud, sharp ringing of the ship's bells, accompanied\nby the reversal of the engines and a general disturbance awaking the\ncrew. So our first impressions on coming on deck were that we had run\naground. But the captain assured us that everything was ship-shape and\nthat this was the nearest point of approach to Capiz, a town of\nconsiderable importance on the island of Panay, where a body of troops\nwas to embark for home. Not even the grass hut of a native was in\nsight. Search as we would, not a sign was seen of a stream flowing\ninto the sea, indicating the probable presence of a town. There was\nnot a sign of life of any kind save one lone column of thin, blue\nsmoke that arose from the side of a mountain miles away. One would\nhave thought that we were explorers of three hundred years ago lying\noff the shore of some unknown land.\n\nAfter breakfast the steam launch, together with all the boats, was\nlowered, and several of us who had determined to miss no opportunity\nto gather information about the islands took our places in the launch\nby the side of the ship's mate, and steamed away across the water with\na long line of boats strung out in the rear. We headed away toward a\ngroup of cocoanut trees, and about an hour later stepped ashore on a\npile of decayed coral rocks that extended some twenty or thirty feet\nout into the water, thus forming the only landing place of a town of\nseveral thousands of people and of considerable commercial importance.\n\nA few moments after we had landed, an army wagon drawn by a\nmagnificent pair of mules came up out of a tropical jungle along a\nnarrow road. We clambered into the wagon and were soon lost in the\ndepths of foliage from which we had just seen the vehicle emerge.\n\nLong waving bamboos with their plumy leafage hung over the road from\neach side, meeting and overlapping in the center until they formed an\narchway so dense that the tropical sun now high in the heavens\npenetrated it only at intervals. At times the wagon sank up to the\nhubs in the soft earth, and the muscles of the mules stood out like\nwhip-cords under the skin as they drew us forward.\n\nAt a sharp turn in the road we came upon the first division of troops\nthat was to embark for home. The look of joy upon their sun-browned\nfaces was inexpressible. Their work was done, and with elastic step\nand smiling faces they saluted us as they passed by. The reign of\nforce was at an end; it was going out with them; the reign of peace\nhad begun; it was coming in with us.\n\nIn the afternoon when we returned from the town the last of the troops\nhad arrived and, as we drove up, the bugle was sounding the call to\nsupper. We noticed native women mingling with the troops and, indeed,\na native woman was in constant attention waiting upon one of the\nsoldiers with whom we ate. Her clothes were clean, her hair was nicely\ncombed, and her general appearance was neat. She seemed to anticipate\nthe slightest wish of the soldier with whom she was. She brought him\nwater to drink, cleaned his plate after the meal and saw that his\nknife, fork, and spoon were put into his haversack.\n\nWe had now finished supper and the launch had returned for the last\nload of troops. The lieutenant in command of the company gave the\norder to \"fall in\"; the men shouldered their rifles and fell into\nline. \"Forward, march!\" called the lieutenant, and the column swept\nforward towards the boats. The women had until now restrained\nthemselves, but, as their husbands marched away never to return, their\nfeelings could no longer be restrained. One young woman of about\neighteen, who was leaning against a rock by the roadside sobbing, when\nher husband passed, leaped up in frenzy of passionate love and caught\nthe rifle from his shoulder. Her first impulse seemed to be to throw\nthe gun away, but suddenly realizing the futility of such an act she\nburst into tears, shouldered the rifle herself and marched on by his\nside. Another woman of more mature age threw her arms around the legs\nof a tall stalwart man, and drew him bodily from the line.\n\nBut the troops marched on and entered the boats. One woman who had\nbeen unnoticed before came down into the shallow water and caught hold\nof our last boat as if to prevent its leaving, while others stood\nmingling their sobs with the sounds of the wavelets as they broke on\nthe sands. As we passed away, an expectant mother, standing in bold\noutline against the twilight sky, threw up her hands in an agony of\ndespair and then sank upon the stones. The curtain had fallen upon a\ndrama in actual life deeper in pathos than any other we had ever seen\nor ever expected to see. Depth of passion, depth of love! Who can\nfathom the human heart?\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. - WHAT THE TEACHERS DID.\n\n\nThere is a remarkable sameness about the towns in the Philippines.\n\nThey all have a large open square about the middle of the town, around\nthree sides of which are Chinese stores, unless one side lies open to\nthe sea, and on the fourth is the great stone ecclesia. The streets\nrun at right angles to one another and divide up the town into\ncreditable squares.\n\nEverybody in the Philippines lives up-stairs, for the ground is so\nsoaked with water during the rainy season that it is a menace to\nhealth to live upon the ground floor. So even the poorest nippa hut\nis built upon stakes four or five feet above the ground.\n\nBacalod is a typical Philippine town. As we landed, a broad open\nsquare was spread out before us. Two sides of the square were lined\nwith two-story houses in which were Chinese stores below and Filipino\nhomes above. On the third side stood the great stone church in whose\nmassive tower the clock was striking the hour of four, while the\nfourth lay open to the sea that had borne us thither.\n\nWe landed, but it was in a method new to us and one not usually\nemployed by the traveling public.\n\nWhen our sail boat ran aground on the sandy bottom a hundred yards or\nmore from the shore, a crowd of Filipino men who were on the beach\nslowly rolled up their pantaloons and waded out to the rescue,--for\nthe money that was in it. The boat's crew elevated their trousers'\nlegs also and slided down into the water. Each of us then straddled\nthe neck of a Filipino standing in the water and was held by ankles to\nbe steadied while our biped mounts proceeded to the shore.\n\nWe were now on the ground and face to face with the situation. To give\nthe reader an idea of the actual conditions met by the first teachers\nwho went to the Islands, the following is copied from the instructions\ngiven us in Manila:\n    1. There shall be two sessions daily of all schools, and the\n    last hour of the morning session shall be devoted solely to\n    instructing the Filipino teachers.\n\n    2. In cases where teachers are sent to a town in which there\n    is no school-house, they are expected to secure the aid of the\n    people and have one built.\n\n    3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is\n    stopped.\n\n    4. All supplies must be kept under lock and key. In towns\n    where there is no case or box to lock the supplies in, and it\n    is also impossible to get the town council to furnish a case,\n    a requisition may be sent to Manila, and, if an appropriation\n    can be secured, one will be made and sent out.\n\nThus it can be easily seen that we were indeed pioneers. In many\nplaces no school-house was to be found, and in some cases it was even\ndifficult to get the town council to provide a case in which to keep\nthe supplies.\n\nThe work of the teachers was, in short; to \"make the English language\nthe basis of instruction in the public schools.\" On our arrival at\nBacalod two schools were found in progress, for some soldiers had been\ndetailed for the work here previous to our coming. One of these was\nfor boys and the other, for girls. Thus the work here had been in a\nmeasure simplified, but complications that had arisen at Talisay, one\nof the largest and richest towns on the island, demanded a change of\nteachers and the writer was assigned to the place as superintendent.\n\nHere an attempt had been made to start a school but it had failed\nignominiously and a system of education was to be put into operation\nfrom the very start.\n\nThe Filipinos are not strong advocates of co-education, so separate\nschools were to be started for the boys and the girls. The one for the\nboys was gotten well in hand before the one for the girls was\nattempted at all.\n\nA few days after reaching the town and securing a home the\npresidente of the town had it publicly announced that the following\nMonday morning at eight o'clock a public school for boys would be\nopened in a building that had been rented for the purpose by the\nmunicipal council. About the middle of the afternoon of the same day a\nman beat a little drum throughout all the streets of the town to call\nthe people out and the town clerk announced both in Spanish and in the\nnative language that this public school would begin at the time and\nplace mentioned above; that instruction would be free to all who came;\nthat the government would furnish all supplies; and that instruction\nwould be given in the English language. A native principal and\nassistants were employed and everything was ready to begin.\n\nThe official report of the result is as follows:\n    Boys' public school of Talisay, Negros, P. I., began November\n    4, 1901. Forty-three boys present at eight o'clock. Forty-one\n    of them knew \"good morning\" and \"good afternoon\" but do not\n    know the distinction between them. Two of them speak simple\n    Spanish. At eight forty-five, eight more, who had been\n    attending an early morning private school, came in together.\n\n    The books they brought were so varied and so different from\n    one another that it seemed impossible to bring any reasonable\n    degree of order out of such a chaos, and so, after struggling\n    vainly for about a week with the problem, the superintendent\n    by one fell stroke removed everything in use and put in a\n    uniform system, and from that day on the English language has\n    been the basis of instruction in the public schools of\n    Talisay. The work was of necessity very slow at first, but by\n    the end of a year two schools were going nicely and a number\n    of the brightest boys and girls had made really excellent\n    progress.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER V. - A \"BAILE.\"\n\n\nNot long after the arrival of our party at Bacalod we received an\ninvitation to a \"baile\" given in our honor by the inhabitants of\nSilay, a town some ten or twelve miles up the northern coast and one\nnoted for its social life. The invitation was accepted with pleasure,\nand about the middle of the afternoon on the day appointed we were\nclad in the immaculate white of the tropics and steaming away up the\ncoast on board a launch sent for our conveyance. Twilight was still\nlingering on the path of day when we anchored just off shore at the\ntown. A row-boat containing the officials of the city came out to meet\nus and, in due season, we were ushered into a spacious drawing-room\nfilled almost to overflowing with the \u00e9lite of the town. The \u00e9lite of\ntowns in the Philippines speak Spanish, and, as only one or two of our\nparty could at that time boast of more than a formal acquaintance with\nthe Castilian tongue, the exchange of ideas that evening between us\nand the Filipinos was of necessity not very rapid.\n\nThe necessity of easy communication between us was rendered somewhat\nless indispensable by the announcement of supper as soon as we were\nrested from our trip. When we had taken our places at the table a\nyoung Filipino about twenty-five years of age arose and gave a lengthy\ntoast to the recent union of the Philippines with the United States.\n\nBut as we Americans were unable to scale the dizzy heights of his\nclimaxes or sink to the depths of his pathos, we forewent the\npleasures of his oratory and turned our attention to the savory odor\nof lamb, chicken, and roast pig that came slyly stealing up our\nnostrils to send us nerve dispatches about the gastronomic delights of\nour not far distant future.\n\nAt last the toast was ended and the world-wide soup ushered in a long\ntrain of things good to eat, served in a style better fitted to the\ndelights of the appetite than to the formalities of dinners, for, as\nsoon as the pleasant task of one dish was completed by any one, the\nnext was served him at once regardless of the progress made by the\nothers at the table.\n\nThe last course was dulce. The new-comers to the Philippines will\nnot be long in making the acquaintance of this dish, and at all\nmeetings, both public and private, where eatables are served, it\nperforms an important part. It is anything sweet, and it may vary all\nthe way from an india-rubber-like black mixture of cocoanut milk and\ndirty sugar to a really toothsome and respectable confection. No\nmatter of what materials a dish is composed, just so long as it is\nsweet, it is dulce.\n\nAfter paying our respects to this last course, we arose from the table\nand entered a great rectangular room from the center of whose ceiling\nhung a large glass chandelier, a mass of shimmering crystals. In the\nchairs around the room were the wealth, the youth, and the beauty of\nthe town.\n\nThe first and also the last number of every Filipino dance of any\nformality is the \"rigodon.\" The dancers are arranged in a square, or\nquadrangle according to the number participating, and are then led\nthrough a tangled maze of figures that so utterly bewilders the novice\nthat he sinks into his chair at the end of the dance wondering how it\nall came to pass.\n\nWe Americans breathed a sigh of relief when the \"rigodon\" ended, and\nmustered fresh courage for social conquests in the waltz that was now\nbreathing forth from the trembling strings. My companion in the first\ndance had been the young lady by whose side I had sat at dinner. But\nit now became necessary to search for another, so I prudently waited\nto see how partners were chosen, and made no mistake when a few\nmoments later I faced one of the most luscious looking se\u00f1oritas on\nthe opposite side of the room and offered her my arm. My eyes must\nhave told the story that my lips could not utter in Spanish, for she\nsmiled upon me sweetly, arose, and put her hand upon my shoulder. My\narm encircled her waist and I began to waltz. Unfortunately my\ncompanion did not follow, but began to hop up and down in a manner\nmost distressing. Supposing the attack to be only temporary, I paused\nand, much to my relief, she soon showed signs of recovery; and in the\ncourse of time she came to a standstill looking up into my face in an\ninquiring sort of way, apparently wondering why St. Vitus had not paid\nhis respects to me also. A second attempt to follow the music met with\nresults similar to the first, and during the third attempt, which\nseemed to be trembling on the verge of a failure, St. Vitus let go my\ncompanion and seized me with such vigor that she, who was small even\nfor a Filipino, was gathered up bodily and taken around the room at\nsuch a pace that her toes touched the floor only at far distant\nintervals.\n\nAt this point my devotion to the shrine of Terpsichore ceased from\nforce of circumstances and I seated myself in one of the most\ncomfortable chairs in sight that I might carry out a previously formed\nplan to study the Filipino somewhat critically as he appears in\nsociety.\n\nThe first thing that impressed me as the dancers passed up and down\nthe room was the flash of diamonds. Nearly every woman in the room had\non a brooch that flashed the colors of the rainbow at every turn.\n\nAlmost all of them wore one or more rings that showed up brilliantly\nunder the chandelier. Many of the men too, especially the young men,\nwore gems that appeared to be exquisite. A closer inspection showed\nthat some of the gems had flaws and others were of a poor color, but\nno one would have denied that, taken as a whole, it was a really\nbeautiful display.\n\nThe dress of the ladies was richly colored. Many of their skirts were\nof silk covered with hand embroidered flowers, and their filmy pina\nwaists and broad collar pieces were rich with needle-work. They all\nwore a kind of heelless velvet slipper, very common as a dress shoe in\nthe Philippines, or high-heeled patent leather shoes with neatly\nfitting black stockings.\n\nThe men were dressed in white coats and white pantaloons or black\ncoats and white pantaloons. White shirts and collars, together with\nall sorts and styles of cravats and low-cut patent leather shoes with\nhighly colored socks completed their dress.\n\nIt was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money;\nthat they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a\ntable loaded with good things was a fact to which all of us were\nenthusiastic witnesses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VI. - A SKETCH OF LIFE IN THE PHILIPPINES.\n\n\nHouse-keeping in the Philippines presents some interesting phases. Our\nclub of American officials decided to run a mess, so we employed a\ncook and a house boy, then each of us provided himself with a personal\nservant, making a total of six servants for four men--it takes about\nthis proportion of servants to live in any sort of comfort in the\nPhilippines--and launched ourselves boldly upon the sea of domestic\neconomy. But there were shoals ahead of us, for the question of\nregulating servants is one of no small importance in the Philippines,\nand one of its most disadvantageous features is the long chain of\ndependents that usually attends it.\n\nWe gave the cooks so much a day with which to buy supplies in the\nlocal market, for our own table, making him render a daily list of\nexpenditures, and a fixed amount besides to purchase rice and fish for\nhimself and the other servants. Of course, if they wished to vary\ntheir diet and get chicken and fresh pork, which could be had at far\ndistant intervals, it was wholly a matter of their option, but the\nallowance was made on the basis of so much rice and fish a day for\neach. This allowance was about fifteen cents a day in Spanish coin per\nservant.\n\nThus far all was well. We had agreed to give the cook eight dollars a\nmonth in Spanish money, thinking that good wages would procure good\nservice, but the visions of affluence that floated before him on such\nfloods of wealth were so alluring that they drew him from the kitchen\nto the cooler veranda. In less than a week he had employed an\nassistant at four dollars a month; in less than another week that\nassistant had employed him an assistant at two dollars a month; in\nless than another week that assistant to the assistant had employed\nhim an assistant at the princely salary of fifty cents a month; and\nfrom fear that the chain of dependents would end only by our having\nthe whole Filipino race attached to our culinary force, we broke up\nhouse-keeping and went boarding again, choosing that as the less of\nthe two evils.\n\nOur house furnishings were almost wholly Philippine. The table ware\nand the food on the table came from the ends of the earth. The knives\nand forks were made in Germany, the plates were manufactured in\nEngland, the glass ware and table cloth, in the United States. The\noatmeal and flour came from the United States also. The butter came\nfrom Australia, the rice from China, the salt from Russia, and the\nother eatables from sources about as various as their separate names.\n\nSwitzerland furnished the condensed milk and Illinois the canned\ncream. Nearly all of the canned fruit bore labels from Spain.\n\nThus it can easily be seen that life in the Philippines, if lived\naccording to American ideals, is dependent upon a highly developed and\nhighly complex commerce. However, the difficulties of transportation\nand the restriction of large stocks of merchandise to Manila and some\nhalf a dozen other towns, make so great a difference between country\nlife and city life that a short comparison of the two will not be out\nof place, and life in Manila may well be taken as being fairly typical\nof the latter.\n\nLife in Manila is pleasant, but expensive. It is pleasant from the\nfact that it is not only the capital but also metropolis of the\narchipelago. Thus the combination of wealth and high official position\nhas given to Manila a society of the highest and most refined type.\n\nThe process of beautifying and improving the city which is constantly\ngoing on bids fair to give us at no distant day a city of which we may\nwell be proud.\n\nBut let him who intends living well in Manila on a small income bid\nfarewell at once to so idylic a dream, for it costs much to live well\nthere. In the city of Manila one can get almost anything he wishes,\nbut it must be paid for at the price it commands. Especially in the\ncase of eatables, this price is by no means small, because to the\nfirst cost of articles must in most cases be added the expense of\ndistant shipment from American, European, or Australian ports, and not\ninfrequently the cost of long refrigeration must also be taken into\nconsideration. But, expensive though it is, it is very pleasant to\nlive there and those who have once enjoyed it often wish again to\nquaff the cup of its delights.\n\nIn strong contrast to this pleasant life is the life of the quiet\nlittle hamlet away in the distant islands. Indeed, the Filipino from\nthe distant town, who by some good fortune has been to Manila, or, by\na coup de main, has studied in one of the Manila colleges, is looked\nup to in a true hero-worshiping attitude by all who either know him or\nhear of his fame. Life in such a place is one long state of harmless\ninactivity. Not a wave of trouble from the great outer world ever\ndisturbs its peaceful repose. One lounges forever in an air of\nindolent ease and extreme aversion to anything approaching what might\nbe called a respectable effort.\n\nOne arises in the morning about the time the sun's first rays silver\nthe top leaves of the cocoanut trees and then stirs around until nine\nor ten o'clock, when it is found expedient to avoid a further exposure\nto the sun. From then until about five o'clock in the afternoon it is\nbest to take things as they come, even though one of those things be a\nFilipino dinner. But then you may have your vehiclo attached to a\nyoung bull with a ring in his nose and go for a drive. If it is the\ndry season you will probably enjoy the drive unless you object to the\nfrequent clouds of dust swept along by the evening wind. If it is in\nthe rainy season your pleasure will depend to a considerable extent\nupon how wet you get; but, whether the season be wet or dry, your\npleasure will be regulated largely by the state of harmony existing\nbetween the driver and the bull.\n\nIn these quiet secluded nooks successive generations of Filipinos are\nborn, reared, grow old and die in an even chain of events broken only\nby the occasional erection of a new grass house on the identical spot\nwhere its predecessors have stood for ages. The son lives in the house\nof his father, cultivates the same few square feet of soil planted in\nedible roots, climbs the same cocoanut trees, follows the same winding\npath down to the stream, pounds rice in the same mortar and with the\nsame stick that his ancestors have used from time unremembered, and,\nin case of illness, curls up on a grass mat in a corner of the room\nuntil he dies or by some good fortune recovers. Beyond this narrow\nhorizon he never looks. So narrow and contracted is the life that the\nlanguages of two towns a few miles apart are so different that one\nwould scarcely recognize them as belonging to the same race of people.\n\nSuch are the two extremes of life in our new far Eastern provinces:\nthe one is active, progressive, and cosmopolitan; the other, inactive,\ndecadent, and narrow; but, whether one enjoys the first or endures the\nsecond, there comes to him after leaving a longing to lounge again in\ntropic airs and listen to the lullaby of the winds among the palms.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VII. - THE FILIPINO AT HOME.\n\n\nAs one enters a Filipino sitting-room for the first time, there is one\nfeature in the arrangement of the furniture that impresses itself upon\nhim at once, and it may be stated without fear of serious\ncontradiction that this same peculiar feature in its arrangement will\ncontinue to face him, as he enters different homes, about as certainly\nas he crosses the threshold.\n\nThe arrangement referred to is that of one large mirror, one settee,\nand some ten or a dozen chairs that appear to have had a certain\norderly affection for one another. The mirror is hung upon one of the\nlarge interior parts of the house about four feet above the floor. The\nwooden houses in the Philippines are built by setting large posts\nupright into the ground, extending into the air from twenty to thirty\nfeet. Cross timbers are fastened to these upright posts about eight or\nten feet above the ground and then not sawed off even with the posts,\nbut allowed to extend beyond them each way. The framework of the house\nis built upon these extending cross timbers, a style of building by\nwhich these large upright posts are left standing out on the inside of\nthe room from one to three feet from the walls. It is on that one of\nthese posts most nearly opposite the door that the mirror always finds\nits place. Immediately beneath the mirror is the settee; and the\nchairs are arranged in two parallel lines facing one another and at\nright angles with the ends of the settee. However odd this arrangement\nmay appear to one when he first enters a Filipino drawing-room, there\nare two things to be said in its favor. In the first place, it places\nyou face to face with the person with whom you are conversing so that\nyou can watch him,--a matter of no small moment in the Philippines. In\nthe next place, it enables you to give one of the young ladies a\nsheep's-eye in the mirror while the others present are left where\nMoses was in our much abused conundrum.\n\nThe size of the residence and the quality of its furnishings depends\nupon the wealth of the owner. But there is so vast a difference\nbetween the mode of life of the highest class and the tao, or lowest\nclass, that it is well to speak of them separately, and the great\nmiddle class of Filipinos can easily be imagined to occupy the\nintervening ground.\n\nThe rich Filipino's house is usually of wood built upon a wall of\nstone or brick from ten to fifteen feet high. The floors are kept\nhighly polished in his hallway, dressing-room, and bed-rooms. There\nare, of course, no fire-places in any of the rooms, but on some\noccasions something is needed to dry the rain-soaked atmosphere, for\neven in the dry season it has been seen to rain for five successive\ndays and nights without the cessation of a moment.\n\nA long chain of dependents is attached to the household of the rich\nFilipino. The master has his special body servant to be present at all\ntimes to do his master's bidding, in short, to be the visible\nmechanism of his master's volition. So, too, the lady of the house has\nher servant woman to do the slightest bidding of her ladyship. Then\nthere is the cook who is almost invariably a man, a house boy or two,\nand the coachman. These functionaries, with their assistants and\nassistants to the assistants, together with a servant or two for the\nexclusive service of the children, complete the economic household.\n\nSuch a family has an abundance of rice and wheat bread, also of\nchicken and fish with occasional fresh beef. They have also a good\ndeal of dulce. They regularly serve wine and frequently serve beer\non their tables.\n\nIn strong contrast with this mode of life is that of the tao. His\ndiet consists almost wholly of rice and small uncleaned fish boiled\ntogether. As a rule knife, fork, plate, and spoon find no place in his\nhousehold. The rice and fish are boiled in a pot and then allowed to\ncool in the same vessel or poured out to cool in a large earthen or\nwooden bowl. Then Mr. Tao together with Mrs. Tao and all the young\nTaos squat on their heels around the mixture and satisfy that\nintangible thing called the appetite. They do not use chop sticks as\nthe Chinese do, but the rice and fish are caught in a hollow formed by\nthe first three fingers of the right hand. The thumb is then placed\nbehind the mass. It is raised up and poised before the mouth, with a\nskill coming from the evolution of ages, when a contraction of the\nmuscles of the thumb throws the mass into the mouth with a skill that\nis marvelous to any but a Filipino. To judge from the most reliable\ninformation, the poorest class do not have an abundance of food,\nalthough it would seem that such a condition of things would be\nwell-nigh impossible. However, in a census of one hundred school\nchildren there were found six boys and four girls who declared that\nthey had never had enough to eat, and the native teacher stated that\nthis was probably true.\n\nThe wide gulf between the tao and the rich man is filled by the\ngreat middle class of Filipinos.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VIII. - VISIT TO A LEPER COLONY.\n\n\nNot far from our town was a leper colony and the first Saturday that\ncould be spared was set aside for a trip to the place. It happened\nthat none of the other Americans were at leisure on this particular\nmorning, but, rather then delay the trip or miss it altogether, the\nwriter, armed with a revolver, started out alone.\n\nThe road had been described so accurately by one who was supposed to\nknow it that it was deemed well-nigh impossible to miss the way. The\nmain highway was followed to the point where the by-path supposed to\nlead to the settlement turned off through some bamboo thickets and a\nlow tropical wood. This path led straight away towards the sea-coast\nwhere the houses of the colony were said to stand in a cocoanut grove\nby the beach.\n\nUpon arriving at the settlement, a very inhospitable reception was\nreceived from a mangy cur that growled and showed a very uninviting\nset of sharp, white teeth behind his snarling lips. The growling of\nthe dog had attracted the attention of an old man who, with age-bent\nback, was pounding rice in a mortar about fifty yards away. He turned\nslowly around and, upon seeing an intruder into the primitive quiet of\nthe place, gave a sharp, far-reaching call. The sound had scarcely\nrung through the grove when from about a dozen of the little grass\nhouses dotted here and there fifteen or twenty men armed with bolos\ncame out and gathered around the old man. A sense of my danger flashed\nupon me. Three miles from town and alone in a tropical jungle, I could\nbe almost instantly overcome by this band of bolo-men, and the only\nreport that would ever reach my people would be that I had\n\"disappeared.\" Of course, attack was by no means certain, but the\npotentiality of the situation was thrilling. A drawn revolver and the\ngleaming of its shining barrel had the effect of stopping the men, who\nseemed to be hesitating as to a course of action, until a somewhat\ndignified retreat was made to an open space in the rear from where a\nless dignified and a more hasty retreat began which did not stop short\nof Bacalod.\n\nEnough had been seen, however, even in this short visit, to give\nconvincing proof that the settlement visited was no colony of lepers;\nso, that afternoon two servant boys being taken as guides and\ninterpreters, another attempt was made to reach the goal desired.\n\nThis attempt was successful, and, after about two hours of walking, a\nlittle cluster of grass huts snugly hidden by the sea-coast came into\nview. As we approached, one would have thought it a gala-day. Some few\nchildren, apparently from six to thirteen years of age, almost wholly\nnude, were romping and playing in the open space around which the huts\nstood, and no one would ever have thought that any cloud so horrible\nas leprosy could hover over a place apparently so happy.\n\nBy the side of the path as we passed was a man and his wife setting\nout potato plants. His hands were so puffed and his fingers so short\nthat he could scarcely use them, but he was working along as best he\ncould. His wife's feet were so swollen and twisted that she walked\nonly with the greatest difficulty. We passed them by and entered the\nopen space above referred to.\n\nThe children now saw us, and those of them who could darted away like\nfrightened rabbits, each to his own burrow. An old man who was sitting\nin the warm afternoon sun on the little bamboo platform before his hut\nwas aroused from his lethargic repose by the scampering away of the\nchildren. He arose, trembling upon his tottering limbs, all drawn and\ntwisted, and hobbled away into his hut.\n\nThe children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at\nthe doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of\nthe settlement. In a few moments we were surrounded by a circle of\nhuman beings at once so repulsive and so pitiable that its graphic\nvividness can never be accurately portrayed.\n\nThe old man referred to above, having put on a pair of snow-white\npantaloons, appeared now at the doorway of his hut, followed a few\nmoments later by his wife who had evidently clothed herself in the\nbest raiment she had. At a call from the old man, all the men, women,\nand children in the settlement came out of their huts and stood in a\nline before us. The old man was spokesman and in his native visayan\ntongue made a heart-rending appeal for aid which we were powerless to\ngive. Attention was called to a leper woman, apparently about\ntwenty-five years of age, whose face had been attacked by the disease\nand whose appearance was truly pathetic. Upon her hip was a child\nabout a year and a half old and, strange to say, the child showed as\nyet no signs whatever of the disease.\n\nWhat an indissoluble enigma is life! Here in a little cluster of grass\nhuts in a secluded nook of a secluded island of an all but secluded\narchipelago was gathered together a little community of wretched\nnatives, driven by their loathsomeness from association with others\neven of the same half-savage race. Yet here, men and women loved and\nwere married, by mutual trust if not by law, and children were born of\nthe union to live forever under the unspeakable horror that\novershadowed the unfortunate parents. Love, hatred, sorrow, and\njoy--every passion that enters into the complex structure of the human\nheart even here, in this scene of sadness and despair, was playing\napparently as freely as where misfortune and disease had never crossed\nthe portals of life.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER IX. - A \"HIKE.\"\n\n\nWe were lounging lazily in our hammocks at Jimamaylan one evening in\nApril. Supper was just ended, and the soldiers in the post were\ncollected in groups here and there spinning yarns to pass away the\ntime, when a Filipino clad only in a loin cloth came down the street\nat a steadily swinging run and stopped in front of the sentry. He\nbrought the announcement that a band of ladrones had just burned a\nsugar mill and were advancing to sack a barrio about fifteen miles\naway.\n\nThe invitation of the commanding officer to go on a \"hike\" was eagerly\naccepted, and, in ten minutes after the message was given, the troops\nwere on the march followed by two adventurous pedagogues.\n\nDarkness was just closing in as we left the town, but a resplendent\ntropic moon soon made the night almost as brilliant as the day. The\ntrail we followed led over rough and rocky country. Sometimes for a\ndistance of a mile or more we passed over barren wastes of volcanic\nslag poured out in anger by some peak whose convulsions have long\nsince ceased. Again we would descend into a tropical jungle from the\ndense foliage of which the ladrones could have leaped at any moment,\nhad they known of our coming, and annihilated our little band. We\nforded rapid streams with the water at our breasts, and halted only\nonce in that rapid march of fifteen miles.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the town we met a man who was standing\nguard against a surprise by the ladrones. Nothing could well have been\nmuch more grotesque and nothing could much better illustrate the\nabsolutely primitive condition of the Filipinos in the interior of the\nislands than the appearance of this guard. A pair of knee pants, a\nconical grass hat, and a hemp shirt formed his entire apparel. A long\nflat wooden shield, a bolo, and a long bamboo spear with a sharp,\nflat, iron point, completed his equipment for battle.\n\nHere stood the first and the twentieth centuries side by side. The\nFilipino who had advanced only a stage beyond the condition of\nprimitive man with his knife, spear, and wooden shield, stood side by\nside with the American soldier, a representative of modern life with\nhis magazine rifle, his canteen, his knapsack,--with every article of\nhis clothing made to give him the highest possible efficiency as the\nunit of a military organization.\n\nA few yards farther on we met another guard equipped similarly to the\nfirst. Upon reaching the town, news had just been received that a\ndetachment of troops from another post had intercepted the ladrones\nand fought a skirmish with them. The ladrones had escaped and we set\nout in pursuit of them on a chase wilder than a Quixotic dream. We\nwound our way into the mountains behind the town, inquiring at every\ngrass hut we passed whether the band of ladrones had passed that way,\nbut only once was even a trace of them found. Then it was learned that\nat a certain place they had separated into groups of three or four and\ngone glimmering through the dream of things that were. This place was\nin a secluded nook of the mountains where in years gone by some\nadventurous Spaniard had erected a primitive water mill to grind his\nsugar-cane. We had now marched about twenty miles and the feet of the\npedagogues were a mass of blisters. They had reached the point where\nthat form of military maneuvering called \"hiking\" ceased to possess\nany alluring charms. So a native was persuaded to come out of his lone\nmountain hut and hitch up his carabao and cart. He was then made to\nget on the carabao's back, while the aforesaid pedagogues lay down on\nthe sugar-cane pulp that had been put into the body of the cart, and\nthe driver was instructed to start for the post we had left hours\nbefore, and not to stop until he got there. Being uncertain but that\nsome of the ladrones would learn of our having left the body of troops\nand would try the metal of our steel, we at first agreed that neither\nof us should go to sleep, but it was later decided that probably the\ndriver had no greater desire to cross the Styx than his passengers had\nand that in case of danger he would awaken us, so both took a revolver\nin each hand, stretched out supinely and went to sleep.\n\nSuch a sleep! The rough jolting of the cart over an almost impassable\nroad was never enough to break the spell of slumber. When we awoke the\nblazing tropic sun was past the midday mark of morning, shining full\ninto our unprotected and well-nigh blistered faces.\n\nA pack of dogs were heralding our approach to a little village at the\nfoot of the mountains where ponies were procured to take us back to\nthe post.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he insists, \"have stood the test of ages; and the plant\nevery where retained its name and credit: and one of our good\nherbarists, who had seen a wonderful case of a swoln spleen, so big, and\nhard as to be felt with terror, brought back to a state of nature by it\"\n\n(p. 37). The greatest portion of Hill's concluding section combines\nadvertisement for the powder medicine he was himself manufacturing at a\nhandsome profit together with a protest against competing apothecaries:\n\"An intelligent person was directed to go to the medicinal herb shops in\nthe several markets, and buy some of this Spleen-wort; the name was\nwritten, and shewn to every one; every shop received his money, and\nalmost every one sold a different plant, under the name of this: but\nwhat is very striking, not one of them the right\" (p. 42).\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis did not cease to be printed after Hill's in\n1766, but continued to issue from the presses into the nineteenth\ncentury. A good example of this is the tome by John Reid, physician to\nthe Finsbury Dispensary in London, Essays on Insanity, Hypochondriasis\nand Other Nervous Affections (1816), which summarizes theories of the\nmalady. A bibliographical study of such works would probably reveal\na larger number of titles in the nineteenth century than in the previous\none, but by this time the nature and definition of hypochondria had\nchanged significantly.\n\nIf John Hill's volume is not an important contribution in the history of\nmedicine, it is a lucid and brief exposition of many of the best ideas\nthat had been thought and written on the hyp, with the exception of his\nuninhibited prescribing of herbal medicines as cure-alls. An\nunderstanding of this disease is essential for readers of neoclassical\nEnglish literature, especially when we reflect upon the fact that some\nof the best literature of the period was composed by writers whom it\nafflicted. It is perhaps not without significance that the greatest poet\nof the Augustan age, Alexander Pope, thought it necessary as he lay on\nhis deathbed in May 1744 to exclaim with his last breath, \"I never was\nhippish in my whole life.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. I. - The NATURE of the DISORDER.\n\n\nTo call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and cruel. It\nis a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by thickened\nand distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver, and other\nparts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick scarce knows\none more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\n\nThe blood is a mixture of many fluids, which, in a state of health, are\nso combined, that the whole passes freely through its appointed vessels;\nbut if by the loss of the thinner parts, the rest becomes too gross to\nbe thus carried through, it will stop where the circulation has least\npower; and having thus stopped it will accumulate; heaping by degrees\nobstruction on obstruction.\n\nHealth and chearfulness, and the quiet exercise of mind, depend upon a\nperfect circulation: is it a wonder then, when this becomes impeded the\nbody looses of its health, and the temper of its sprightliness? to be\notherwise would be the miracle; and he inhumanly insults the afflicted,\nwho calls all this a voluntary frowardness. Its slightest state brings\nwith it sickness, anguish and oppression; and innumerable ills follow\nits advancing steps, unless prevented by timely care; till life itself\ngrows burthensome.\n\nThe disease was common in antient Greece; and her physicians understood\nit, better than those perhaps of later times, in any other country; who\nthough happy in many advantages these fathers of the science could not\nhave, yet want the great assistance of frequent watching it in all its\nstages.\n\nThose venerable writers have delivered its nature, and its cure: in the\nfirst every thing now shews they were right; and what they have said as\nto the latter will be found equally true and certain. This, so far as\npresent experience has confirmed it, and no farther, will be here laid\nbefore the afflicted in a few plain words.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. II. - Persons Subject to it.\n\n\nFatigue of mind, and great exertion of its powers often give birth to\nthis disease; and always tend to encrease it. The finer spirits are\nwasted by the labour of the brain: the Philosopher rises from his study\nmore exhausted than the Peasant leaves his drudgery; without the benefit\nthat he has from exercise. Greatness of mind, and steady virtue;\ndetermined resolution, and manly firmness, when put in action, and\nintent upon their object, all also lead to it: perhaps whatever tends to\nthe ennobling of the soul has equal share in bringing on this weakness\nof the body.\n\nFrom this we may learn easily who are the men most subject to it; the\ngrave and studious, those of a sedate temper and enlarged understanding,\nthe learned and wise, the virtuous and the valiant: those whom it were\nthe interest of the world to wish were free from this and every other\nillness; and who perhaps, except for this alloy, would have too large a\nportion of human happiness.\n\nThough these are most, it is not these alone, who are subject to it.\n\nThere are countries where it is endemial, and in other places some have\nthe seeds of it in their constitution; and in some it takes rise from\naccidents. In these last it is the easiest of cure; and in the first\nmost difficult.\n\nBeside the Greeks already named, the Jews of old time were heavily\nafflicted with this disease; and in their descendants to this day it is\noften constitutional: the Spaniards have it almost to a man; and so have\nthe American Indians. Perhaps the character of these several nations may\nbe connected with it. The steady honour, and firm valour of the\nSpaniard, very like that of the ancient Doric nation, who followed the\nflute not the trumpet to the field; and met the enemy, not with shouts\nand fury, but with a determined virtue: it is the temper of the\nHypochondriac to be slow, but unmoveably resolved: the Jew has shewn\nthis mistakenly, but almost miraculously; and the poor Indian, untaught\nas he is, faces all peril with composure, and sings his death-song with\nan unalter'd countenance.\n\nAmong particular persons the most inquiring and contemplative are those\nwho suffer oftenest by this disease; and of all degrees of men I think\nthe clergy. I do not mean the hunting, shooting, drinking clergy, who\nbear the tables of the great; but the retir'd and conscientious; such as\nattend in midnight silence to their duty; and seek in their own cool\nbreasts, or wheresoever else they may be found, new admonitions for an\nage plunged in new vices. To this disease we owe the irreparable loss of\nDr. YOUNG; and the present danger of many other the best and most\nimproved amongst us. May what is here to be proposed assist in their\npreservation!\n\nThe Geometrician or the learned Philosopher of whatever denomination,\nwhose course of study fixes his eye for ever on one object, his mind\nintensely and continually employed upon one thought, should be warned\nalso that he is in danger; or if he find himself already afflicted, he\nshould be told that the same course of life, which brought it on, will,\nwithout due care, encrease it to the most dreaded violence.\n\nThe middle period of life is that in which there is the greatest danger\nof an attack from this disease; and the latter end of autumn, when the\nsummer heats have a little time been over, is the season when in our\nclimate its first assaults are most to be expected. The same time of the\nyear always increases the disorder in those who have been before\nafflicted with it; and it is a truth must be confessed, that from its\nfirst attack the patient grows continually, though slowly, worse; unless\na careful regimen prevent it.\n\nThe constitutions most liable to this obstruction are the lean, and dark\ncomplexioned; the grave and sedentary. Let such watch the first\nsymptoms; and obviate, (as they may with ease) that which it will be\nmuch more difficult to remove.\n\nIt is happy a disease, wherein the patient must do a great deal for\nhimself, falls, for the most part, upon those who have the powers of\nreason strongest. Let them only be aware of this, that the distemper\nnaturally disposes them to inactivity; and reason will have no use\nunless accompanied with resolution to enforce it.\n\nThough the physician can do something toward the cure, much more depends\nupon the patient; and here his constancy of mind will be employed most\nhappily. No one is better qualified to judge on a fair hearing what\ncourse is the most fit; and having made that choice, he must with\npatience wait its good effects. Diseases that come on slowly must have\ntime for curing; an attention to the first appearances of the disorder\nwill be always happiest; because when least established it is easiest\noverthrown: but when that happy period has been neglected, he must wait\nthe effects of such a course as will dilute and melt the obstructing\nmatter gradually; for till that be done it is not only vain, but\nsometimes dangerous, to attempt its expulsion from the body.\n\nThe blood easily separates itself into the grosser and the thinner\nparts: we see this in bleeding; and from the toughness of the red cake\nmay guess how very difficult it will be to dissolve a substance of like\nfirmness in the vessels of the body. That it can thus become thickened\nwithin the body, a Pleurisy shews us too evidently: in that case it is\nbrought on suddenly, and with inflammation; in this other, slowly and\nwithout; and here, even before it forms the obstruction, can bring on\nmany mischiefs. Various causes can produce the same effect, but that in\nall cases operates most durably, which operates most slowly. The watery\npart of the blood is its mild part; in the remaining gross matter of it,\nare acrid salts and burning oils, and these, when destitute of that\nhappy dilution nature gives them in a healthy body, are capable of doing\ngreat mischief to the tender vessels in which they are kept stagnant.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. III. - The SYMPTOMS of the DISORDER.\n\n\nThe first and lightest of the signs that shew this illness are a lowness\nof spirits, and inaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love\nof solitude and a habit of thinking, even on trifling subjects, with too\nmuch steadiness. A very little help may combat these: but if that\nindolence which is indeed a part of the disorder, will neglect them;\nworse must be expected soon to follow.\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness, weight, and oppression in the body,\na want of appetite, or, what is worse, an appetite without digestion;\nfor these are the conditions of different states of the disease, a\nfullness and a difficulty of breathing after meals, a straitness of the\nbreast, pains and flatulencies in the bowels, and an unaptness to\ndischarge their contents.\n\nThe pulse becomes low, weak, and unequal; and there are frequent\npalpitations of the heart, a little dark-coloured urine is voided at\nsome times; and a flood of colourless and insipid at others; relieving\nfor a moment, but increasing the distemper: there is in some cases also\na continual teazing cough, with a choaking stoppage in the throat at\ntimes; then heartburn, sickness, hardness of the belly, and a costive\nhabit, or a tormenting and vain irritation.\n\nThe lips turn pale, the eyes loose their brightness and by degrees the\nwhite grows as it were greenish, the gums want their due firmness, with\ntheir proper colour; and an unpleasing foulness grows upon the teeth:\nthe inside of the mouth is pale and furred, and the throat dry and\nhusky: the colour of the skin is pale (though there are periods when the\nface is florid) and as the obstruction gathers ground, and more affects\nthe liver, the whole body becomes yellow, tawny, greenish, and at length\nof that deep and dusky hue, to which men of swift imagination have given\nthe name of blackness.\n\nThese symptoms do not all appear in any one period of the disease, or in\none case, but at one time or other all of them, as well as those which\nfollow: the flesh becomes cold to the touch, though the patient does not\nhimself perceive it; the limbs grow numbed and torpid, the breathing\ndull and slow, and the voice hollow; and usually the appetite in this\nperiod declines, and comes almost to nothing: night sweats come on,\nblack swellings appear on the veins, the flesh wastes and the breast\nbecomes flat and hollow: the mouth is full of a thin spittle, the head\nis dizzy and confus'd, and sometimes there is an unconquerable numbness\nin the organs of speech.\n\nI have known the temporary silence that follows upon this last symptom\nbecome a jest to the common herd; and the unhappy patient, instead of\ncompassion and assistance, receive the reproof of sullenness, from those\nwho should have known and acted better.\n\nAbout twenty years ago I met on a visit at Catthorpe in Leicestershire a\nyoung gentleman of distinguished learning and abilities, who at certain\ntimes was speechless. The vulgar thought it a pretence: and a jocose\nlady, where he was at tea with company, putting him as she said to a\ntrial, poured out a dish very strong and without sugar. He drank it and\nreturned the cup with a bow of great reserve, and his eye bent on the\nground: she then filled the cup with sugar, and pouring weak tea on it,\nsent it him: he drank that too, looked at her steadily, and blushed for\nher. The lady declared the man was dumb; the rest thought him perverse,\nand obstinate; but a constant and steady perseverance in an easy method\ncured him.\n\nAll these are miseries which the disease, while it retains its natural\nform, can bring upon the patient; and thus he will in time be worn out,\nand led miserably, though slowly, to the grave. Let him not indulge his\ninactivity so far as to give way to this, because it is represented as\nfar off; the disease may suddenly and frightfully change its nature; and\nswifter evils follow.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. IV. - The DANGER.\n\n\nWe have done with the obstruction considered in itself; but this, though\noften unsurmountable by art, at least by the methods now in use, will be\nsometimes broken through at once by nature, or by accidents; and bring\non fatal evils. These are strictly different diseases, and are no\notherway concerned here, than as the consequences of that of which we\nare treating.\n\nThe thick and glutinous blood which has so long stagnated in the spleen,\nwill have in that time altered its nature, and acquired a very great\ndegree of acrimony: while it lies dormant, this does no more mischiefs,\nthan those named already; but when violent exercise, a fit of outrageous\nanger, or any thing else that suddenly shocks and disturbs the frame,\nputs it in motion, it melts at once into a kind of liquid putrefaction.\n\nBeing now thin, it mixes itself readily with the blood again, and brings\non putrid fevers; destroys the substance of the spleen itself, or being\nthrown upon some other of the viscera, corrodes them, and leads on this\nway a swift and miserable death. If it fall upon the liver, its tender\npulpy substance is soon destroyed, jaundices beyond the help of art\nfirst follow, then dropsies and all their train of misery; if on lungs,\nconsumptions; if on the brain, convulsions, epilepsy, palsy, apoplexy;\nif on the surface, leprosy.\n\nThe intention of cure is to melt this coagulation softly, not to break\nit violently; and then to give it a very gentle passage through the\nbowels. There is no safe way for it to take but that; and even that when\nurged too far may bring on fatal dysenteries.\n\nLet none wonder at the sudden devastation which sometimes arises from\nthis long stagnant matter, when liquified too hastily: how long, how\nmany years the impacted matter will continue quiet in a schirrous tumour\nof the breast; but being once put in motion, whether from accident, or\nin the course of nature, what can describe; or what can stop its\nhavock!\n\nInstances of the other are too frequent. A nobleman the other day died\nparalytick: dissection shewed a spleen consumed by an abscess, formed\nfrom the dissolved matter of such an obstruction: and 'tis scarce longer\nsince, a learned gentleman, who had been several years lost to his\nfriends, by the extreams of a Hypochondriacal disorder, seem'd gradually\nwithout assistance to recover: but the lungs suffered while the spleen\nwas freed; and he died very soon of what is called a galloping\nconsumption.\n\nWhen the obstruction is great and of long continuance, if it be thus\nhastily moved, the consequence is, equally, a sudden and a miserable\ndeath, whether, like the matter of a cancer, it remains in its place; or\nlike that of a bad small pox, be thrown upon some other vital part.\n\nLet not the patient be too much alarmed; this is laid down to caution,\nnot to terrify him: it is fit he should know his danger, and attend to\nit; for the prevention is easy; and the cure, even of the most advanced\nstages, when undertaken by gentle means, is not at all impracticable: to\nassist the physician, let him look into himself, and recollect the\nsource of his complaint. This he may judge of from the following\nnotices.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. V. - The Causes of the HYPOCHONDRIASIS.\n\n\nThe obstruction which forms this disease, may take its origin from\ndifferent accidents: a fever ill cured has often caused it; or the\npiles, which had been used to discharge largely, ceasing; a marshy soil,\npoisoned with stagnant water, has given it to some persons; and altho'\nindolence and inactivity are oftenest at the root, yet it has arisen\nfrom too great exercise.\n\nReal grief has often brought it on; and even love, for sometimes that is\nreal. Study and fixed attention of the mind have been accused before;\nand add to these the stooping posture of the body, which most men use,\nthough none should use it, in writing and in reading. This has\ncontributed too much to it; but of all other things night studies are\nthe most destructive. The steady stillness, and dusky habit of all\nnature in those hours, enforce, encourage, and support that settled\ngloom, which rises from fixt thought; and sinks the body to the grave;\neven while it carries up the mind to heaven. He who would have his lamp\n        At midnight hour\n  Be seen in some high lonely tower,\nwill waste the flame of this unheeded life: and while he labours to\nunsphere the spirit of Plato will let loose his own.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VI. - The Cure of the HYPOCHONDRIASIS.\n\n\nLet him who would escape the mischiefs of an obstructed spleen, avoid\nthe things here named: and let him who suffers from the malady,\nendeavour to remember to which of them it has been owing; for half the\nhope depends upon that knowledge.\n\nNature has sometimes made a cure herself, and we should watch her ways;\nfor art never is so right as when it imitates her: sometimes the\npatient's own resolution has set him free. This is always in his power,\nand at all times will do wonders.\n\nThe bleeding of the piles, from nature's single efforts, has at once\ncured a miserable man; where their cessation was the cause of the\ndisorder. A leprosy has appeared upon the skin, and all the symptoms of\nthe former sickness vanished. This among the Jews happened often: both\ndiseases we know were common among them: and I have here seen something\nvery like it: Water-Dock has thrown out scorbutic eruptions, and all the\nformer symptoms of an Hypochondriacal disorder have disappeared:\nreturning indeed when these were unadvisedly struck in; but keeping off\nentirely when they were better treated. A natural purging unsuppressed\nhas sometimes done the same good office: but this is hazardous.\n\nIt is easy to be directed from such instances; only let us take the\nwhole along with us. Bleeding would have answered nature's purpose, if\nshe could not have opened of herself the h\u00e6morrhoidal vessels; but he\nwho should give medicines for that purpose, might destroy his patient by\ntoo great disturbance. If a natural looseness may perform the cure, so\nmay an artificial; when the original source of the disorder points that\nway. But these are helps that take place only in particular cases.\n\nThe general and universal method of cure must be by some mild and gently\nresolving medicine, under the influence of which the obstructing matter\nmay be voided that, or some other way with safety. The best season to\nundertake this is the autumn, but even here there must be caution.\n\nIn the first place, no strong evacuating remedy must be given; for that,\nby carrying off the thinner parts of the juices, will tend to thicken\nthe remainder; and certainly encrease the distemper. No acrid medicine\nmust be directed, for that may act too hastily, dissolve the impacted\nmatter at once, and let it loose, to the destruction of the sufferer; no\nantimonial, no mercurial, no martial preparation must be taken; in\nshort, no chymistry: nature is the shop that heaven has set before us,\nand we must seek our medicine there. The venerable ancients, who knew\nnot this new art, will lead us in the search; and (faithful relators as\nthey are of truth) will tell us whence we may deduce our hope; and what\nwe are to fear.\n\nBut prior to the course of any medicine, and as an essential to any good\nhope from it, the patient must prescribe himself a proper course of\nlife, and a well chosen diet: let us assist him in his choice; and speak\nof this first, as it comes first in order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VI. - Rules of Life for Hypochondriac Persons.\n\n\nAir and exercise, as they are the best preservers of health, and\ngreatest assistants in the cure of all long continued diseases, will\nhave their full effect in this; but there requires some caution in the\nchoice, and management of them. It is common to think the air of high\ngrounds best; but experience near home shews otherwise: the\nHypochondriac patient is always worse at Highgate even than in London.\n\nThe air he breathes should be temperate; not exposed to the utmost\nviolences of heat and cold, and the swift changes from one to the\nother; which are most felt on those high grounds. The side of a hill is\nthe best place for him: and though wet grounds are hurtful; yet let\nthere be the shade of trees, to tempt him often to a walk; and soften by\ntheir exhalation the over dryness of the air.\n\nThe exercise he takes should be frequent; but not violent. Motion\npreserves the firmness of the parts, and elasticity of the vessels; it\nprevents that aggregation of thick humours which he is most to fear. A\nsedentary life always produces weakness, and that mischief always\nfollows: weak eyes are gummy, weak lungs are clogged with phlegm, and\nweak bowels waste themselves in vapid diarrhoeas.\n\nLet him invite himself abroad, and let his friends invite him by every\ninnocent inducement. For me, I should advise above all other things the\nstudy of nature. Let him begin with plants: he will here find a\ncontinual pleasure, and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful\nthings; even of the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to\nwalk; and every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket,\nwill afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually\nin the air, and continually to change the nature and quality of the air,\nby visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the lawn, the\nheath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be abroad; and the\nunceasing variety of the subjects of his observation, will prevent his\nwalking hastily: he will pursue his studies in the air; and that\ncontemplative turn of mind, which in his closet threatened his\ndestruction, will thus become the great means of his recovery.\n\nIf the mind tire upon this, from the repeated use, another of nature's\nkingdoms opens itself at once upon him; the plant he is weary of\nobserving, feeds some insect he may examine; nor is there a stone that\nlies before his foot, but may afford instruction and amusement.\n\nEven what the vulgar call the most abject things will shew a wonderful\nutility; and lead the mind, in pious contemplation higher than the\nstars. The poorest moss that is trampled under foot, has its important\nuses: is it at the bottom of a wood we find it? why there it shelters\nthe fallen seeds; hides them from birds, and covers them from frost;\nand thus becomes the foster father of another forest! creeps it along\nthe surface of a rock? even there its good is infinite! its small roots\nrun into the stone, and the rains make their way after them; the moss\nhaving lived its time dies; it rots and with the mouldered fragments of\nthe stone forms earth; wherein, after a few successions, useful plants\nmay grow, and feed more useful cattle!\n\nIs there a weed more humble in its aspect, more trampled on, or more\ndespised than knot grass! no art can get the better of its growth, no\nlabour can destroy it; 'twere pity if they could, for the thing lives\nwhere nothing would of use to us; and its large and most wonderfully\nabundant seeds, feed in hard winters, half the birds of Heaven.\n\nWhat the weak moss performs upon the rock the loathed toadstool brings\nabout in timber: is an oak dead where man's eye will not find it? this\nfungus roots itself upon the bark, and rots the wood beneath it; hither\nthe beetle creeps for shelter, and for sustenance; him the woodpecker\nfollows as his prey; and while he tears the tree in search of him, he\nscatters it about the ground; which it manures.\n\nNor is it the beetle alone that thus insinuates itself into the\nsubstance of the vegetable tribe: the tender aphide, whom a touch\ndestroys, burrows between the two skins of a leaf, for shelter from his\nwinged enemies; tracing, with more than Dedal\u00e6an art, his various\nmeanders; and veining the green surface with these white lines more\nbeautifully than the best \u00c6gyptian marble.\n\n'Twere endless to proceed; nor is it needful: one object will not fail\nto lead on to another, and every where the goodness of his God will\nshine before him even in what are thought the vilest things; his\ngreatness in the lead of them.\n\nLet him pursue these thoughts, and seek abroad the objects and the\ninstigations to them: but let him in these and all other excursions\navoid equally the dews of early morning, and of evening.\n\nThe more than usual exercise of this prescription will dispose him to\nmore than customary sleep, let him indulge it freely; so far from\nhurting, it will help his cure.\n\nLet him avoid all excesses: drink need scarce be named, for we are\nwriting to men of better and of nobler minds, than can be tempted to\nthat humiliating vice. Those who in this disorder have too great an\nappetite, must not indulge it; much eaten was never well digested: but\nof all excesses the most fatal in this case is that of venery. It is the\nexcess we speak of.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VII. - The proper DIET.\n\n\nIn the first place acids must be avoided carefully; and all things that\nare in a state of fermentation, for they will breed acidity. Provisions\nhardened by salting never should be tasted; much less those cured by\nsmoaking, and by salting. Bacon is indigestible in an Hypochondriac\nstomach; and hams, impregnated as is now the custom, with acid fumes\nfrom the wood fires over which they are hung, have that additional\nmischief.\n\nMilk ought to be a great article in the diet: and even in this there\nshould be choice. The milk of grass-fed cows has its true quality: no\nother. There are a multitude of ways in which this may be made a part\nboth of our foods and drinks, and they should all be used.\n\nThe great and general caution is that the diet be at all times of a kind\nloosening and gently stimulating; light but not acrid. Veal, lamb,\nfowls, lobsters, crabs, craw-fish, fresh water fish and mutton broth,\nwith plenty of boiled vegetables, are always right; and give enough\nvariety.\n\nRaw vegetables are all bad: sour wines, old cheese, and bottled beer are\nthings never to be once tasted. Indeed much wine is wrong, be it of what\nkind soever. It is the first of cordials; and as such I would have it\ntaken in this disease when it is wanted: plainly as a medicine, rather\nthan a part of diet. Malt liquor carefully chosen is certainly the best\ndrink. This must be neither new, nor tending to sourness; perfectly\nclear, and of a moderate strength: it is the native liquor of our\ncountry, and the most healthful.\n\nToo much tea weakens; and even sugar is in this disorder hurtful: but\nhoney may supply its place in most things; and this is not only harmless\nbut medicinal; a very powerful dissolvent of impacted humours, and a\ngreat deobstruent.\n\nWhat wine is drank should be of some of the sweet kinds. Old Hock has\nbeen found on enquiry to yield more than ten times the acid of the sweet\nwines; and in red Port, at least in what we are content to call so,\nthere is an astringent quality, that is most mischievous in these cases:\nit is said there is often alum in it: how pregnant with mischief that\nmust be to persons whose bowels require to be kept open, is most\nevident. Summer fruits perfectly ripe are not only harmless but\nmedicinal; but if eaten unripe they will be very prejudicial. A light\nsupper, which will leave an appetite for a milk breakfast, is always\nright; this will not let the stomach be ravenous for dinner, as it is\napt to be in those who make that their only meal.\n\nOne caution more must be given, and it may seem a strange one: it is\nthat the patient attend regularly to his hours of eating. We have to do\nwith men for the most part whose soul is the great object of their\nregard; but let them not forget they have a body.\n\nThe late Dr. STUKELY has told me, that one day by appointment visiting\nSir ISAAC NEWTON, the servant told him, he was in his study. No one was\npermitted to disturb him there; but as it was near dinner time, the\nvisitor sat down to wait for him. After a time dinner was brought in; a\nboil'd chicken under a cover. An hour pass'd, and Sir ISAAC did not\nappear. The doctor eat the fowl, and covering up the empty dish, bad\nthem dress their master another. Before that was ready, the great man\ncame down; he apologiz'd for his delay, and added, \"give me but leave to\ntake my short dinner, and I shall be at your service; I am fatigued and\nfaint.\" Saying this, he lifted up the cover; and without any emotion,\nturned about to STUKELY with a smile; \"See says he, what we studious\npeople are, I forgot I had din'd.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VIII. - The MEDICINE.\n\n\n'Tis the ill fate of this disease, more than of all others to be\nmisunderstood at first, and thence neglected; till the physician shakes\nhis head at a few first questions. None steals so fatally upon the\nsufferer: its advances are by very slow degrees; but every day it grows\nmore difficult of cure.\n\nThat this obstruction in the spleen is the true malady, the cases\nrelated by the antients, present observation, and the unerring\ntestimonies of dissections leave no room to doubt. Being understood, the\npath is open where to seek a remedy: and our best guides in this, as in\nthe former instance, will be those venerable Greeks; who saw a thousand\nof these cases, where we see one; and with less than half our theory,\ncured twice as many patients.\n\nOne established doctrine holds place in all these writers; that whatever\nby a hasty fermentation dissolves the impacted matter of the\nobstruction, and sends it in that state into the blood, does incredible\nmischief: but that whatever medicine softens it by slow degrees, and, as\nit melts, delivers it to the bowels without disturbance; will cure with\nequal certainty and safety.\n\nFor this good purpose, they knew and tried a multitude of herbs; but in\nthe end they fixed on one: and on their repeated trials of this, they\nbanished all the rest. This stood alone for the cure of the disease; and\nfrom its virtue received the name of SPLEEN-WORT. O wise and happy\nGreeks! authors of knowledge and perpetuators of it! With them the very\nname they gave a plant declared its virtues: with us, a writer calls a\nplant from some friend; that the good gardener who receives the honour,\nmay call another by his name who gave it. We now add the term smooth\nto this herb, to distinguish it from another, called by the same general\nterm, though not much resembling it.\n\nThe virtues of this smooth Spleen-wort have flood the test of ages; and\nthe plant every where retained its name and credit: and one of our good\nherbalists, who had seen a wonderful case of a swoln spleen, so big, and\nhard as to be felt with terror, brought back to a state of nature by it;\nand all the miserable symptoms vanish; thought Spleen-wort not enough\nexpressive of its excellence; but stamp'd on it the name of MILT-WASTE.\n\nIn the Greek Islands now, the use of it is known to every one; and even\nthe lazy monks who take it, are no longer splenetic. In the west of\nEngland, the rocks are stripped of it with diligence; and every old woman\ntells you how charming that leaf is for bookish men: in Russia they use\na plant of this kind in their malt liquor: it came into fashion there\nfor the cure of this disease; which from its constant use is scarce\nknown any longer; and they suppose 'tis added to their liquor for a\nflavour.\n\nThe ancients held it in a kind of veneration; and used what has been\ncalled a superstition in the gathering it. It was to be taken up with a\nsharp knife, without violence, and laid upon the clean linen: no time\nbut the still darkness of the night was proper, and even the moon was\nnot to shine upon it. I know they have been ridiculed for this; for\nnothing is so vain as learned ignorance: but let me be permitted once to\nvindicate them.\n\nThe plant has leaves that can close in their sides; and their under part\nis covered thick with a yellow powder, consisting of the seeds, and seed\nvessels: in these they knew the virtue most resided: this was the golden\ndust they held so valuable; and this they knew they could not be too\ncautious to preserve. They were not ignorant of the sleep of plants; a\nmatter lately spoken of by some, as if a new discovery; and being\nsensible that light, a dry air, an expanded leaf, and a tempestuous\nseason, were the means of losing this fine dust; and knowing also that\ndarkness alone brought on that closing of the leaf which thence has\nbeen called sleep; and which helped to defend and to secure it, they\ntherefore took such time, and used such means as could best preserve the\nplant entire; and even save what might be scattered from it.--And now\nwhere is their superstition?\n\nFrom this plant thus collected they prepared a medicine, which in a\ncourse of forty days scarce ever failed to make a perfect cure.\n\nWe have the plant wild with us; and till the fashion of rough chemical\npreparations took off our attention from these gentler remedies, it was\nin frequent use and great repute. I trust it will be so again: and many\nthank me for restoring it to notice.\n\nSpleen-wort gives out its virtues freely in a tincture; and a small dose\nof this, mixing readily with the blood and juices, gradually dissolves\nthe obstruction; and by a little at a time delivers its contents to be\nthrown off without pain, from the bowels. Let this be done while the\nviscera are yet sound and the cure is perfect. More than the forty days\nof the Greek method is scarce ever required; much oftener two thirds of\nthat time suffice; and every day, from the first dose of it, the patient\nfeels the happy change that is growing in his constitution. His food no\nmore turns putrid on his stomach, but yields its healthful nourishment.\n\nThe swelling after meals therefore vanishes; and with that goes the\nlowness, and anxiety, the difficult breath, and the distracting cholick:\nhe can bear the approach of rainy weather without pain; he finds himself\nmore apt for motion, and ready to take that exercise which is to be\nassistant in his cure; life seems no longer burthensome. His bowels get\ninto the natural condition of health, and perform their office once at\nleast a day; better if a little more: the dull and dead colour of his\nskin goes off, his lips grow red again, and every sign of health\nreturns.\n\nLet him who takes the medicine, say whether any thing here be\nexaggerated. Let him, if he pleases to give himself the trouble, talk\nover with me, or write to me, this gradual decrease of his complaints,\nas he proceeds in his cure. My uncertain state of health does not\npermit me to practise physic in the usual way, but I am very desirous to\ndo what good I can, and shall never refuse my advice, such as it may be,\nto any person rich or poor, in whatever manner he may apply for it. I\nshall refer him to no apothecary, whose bills require he should be\ndrenched with potions; but tell him, in this as in all other cases,\nwhere to find some simple herb; which he may if he please prepare\nhimself; or if he had rather spare that trouble, may have it so prepared\nfrom me.\n\nWith regard to Spleen-wort, no method of using it is more effectual than\nsimply taking it in powder; the only advantage of a tincture, is that a\nproper dose may be given, and yet the stomach not be loaded with so\nlarge a quantity: it is an easier and pleasanter method, and nothing\nmore.\n\nIf any person choose to take it in the other way, I should still wish\nhim once at least to apply to me; that he may be assured what he is\nabout to take is the right plant. Abuses in medicines are at this time\nvery great, and in no instance worse than what relates to herbs. The\nbest of our physicians have complained upon this head with warmth, but\nwithout redress: they know the virtues and the value of many of our\nnative plants, but dread to prescribe them; lest some wrong thing should\nbe administered in their place; perhaps inefficacious, perhaps\nmischievous, nay it may be fatal. The few simple things I direct are\nalways before me; and it will at all times be a pleasure to me, in this\nand any other instance, to see whether what any person is about to take\nbe right. I have great obligations to the public, and this is the best\nreturn that I know how to make.\n\nTo see the need of such a caution, hear a transaction but of yesterday!\n\nAn intelligent person was directed to go to the medicinal herb shops in\nthe several markets, and buy some of this Spleen-wort; the name was\nwritten, and shewn to every one; every shop received his money, and\nalmost every one sold a different plant, under the name of this: but\nwhat is very striking, not one of them the right. Such is the chance of\nhealth in those hands through which the best means of it usually pass;\neven in the most regular course of application.\n\nI would not be understood to limit the little services I may this way be\nable to render the afflicted, to this single instance; much less to\npropose to myself any advantages from it. Whoever pleases will be\nwelcome to me, upon any such occasion; and whatever be the herb on which\nhe places a dependance, he shall be shewn it growing. I once recommended\na garden to be established for this use, at the public expence: one\ngreat person has put it in my power to answer all its purposes.\n\n                        F  I  N  I  S.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris, he was\n\"nominated\" to the Academy. He had but to present an Historical\nPainting in order to take his seat as an Academician.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VENUS AND MARRIAGE\n\n\nBack in his beloved Paris again; thrilled by the atmosphere and gaiety\nof its merry life; in the full vigour of manhood on the eve of his\nthirties; amongst congenial friends; done with the drudgery of winning\nto Academic honour, Boucher saw that the public were not falling over\neach other to purchase religious or historic pictures; he straightway\nturned his back upon these things, and on the edge of his thirtieth\nyear he gave to the world his \"Marriage of the Children of God with\nthe Children of Men,\" in which Venus is the avowed mistress of his\nadoration. It caused a fine stir, and greatly increased his repute.\n\nIn this picture he ends his Italian period and strikes his own\npersonal note. Both this and the \"Venus asking arms for Aeneas from\nVulcan,\" together with the \"Birth of Adonis\" and the \"Death of\nAdonis,\" of about the same period, still show Boucher strongly under\nthe influence of his master, Lemoyne. Indeed, the \"Birth\" and \"Death\nof Adonis,\" their record lost during the scuffle and confusion of the\nRevolution, for long hung side by side as pictures by Lemoyne, until,\nbeing cleaned about 1860, Boucher's initials were discovered upon\nthem, and, contemporary engravings being hunted up, still further\nproved their origin. But in the Venus that now figures in all his\nworks there is that flesh-painting of the nude, and that rosy touch\nupon the flesh of the female figure, that are a far more certain\nsignature of Boucher's handiwork than any written name.\n\nUnfortunately the Salons were closed during Boucher's earlier years\nuntil he was thirty-four, and the record of his work during these\nyears is difficult to follow; but with his service to Venus his\npersonal career begins, and the stream of his Venus-pieces steadily\nflows from his hands.\n\nHe came to her service rid of all prentice essays in craftsmanship, a\nfinished and consummate artist. He found in his subject a goddess to\nwhom he could devote his great and splendid gifts. He painted her\ndainty body with a radiant delight and a rare colour-sense such as\nFrance had never before seen or uttered. He remains to this day the\nfirst painter of the subtle, delicate, and elusive thing that is\nfemininity; he caught her allure, her charm, as he was to catch the\nfragrance and charm of children and flowers; and he set the statement\nof these things upon canvas as they have never been uttered.\n\nThe whole of his life long, Boucher gave himself up with equal and\npassionate devotion to work and to pleasure--working at his easel\noften twelve hours of his day without losing, to the end when the\nbrush fell from his dead fingers, his blitheness of heart or his\ngenerosity of act, and without weakening the pleasure-loving desires\nof his gadding spirit. Out of his splendid toil he made the means to\nindulge his tastes for pleasure; and the gratifying of his tastes in\nturn renewed and created the ideas that made the subjects of his\nartistry. He brought to all he did a joy in the doing that made of his\nvast labour one long pleasure--of his pleasures a riot of industry. He\nplayed as he toiled, scarce knowing which was play and which toil.\n\nThe gossip of his love-affairs makes no romantic story--they were but\ncommonplace ecstasies with unknown frail women. But hard as he worked\nand lived and played, he found time to get himself married in his\nthirtieth year to pretty seventeen-year-old Marie Jeanne Buseau, a\nlittle Parisian--and for love of her, so far as he understood the\nbusiness; for she brought him no dowry.\n\nThe young couple settled down for the next ten years in the Rue\nSaint-Thomas-du-Louvre. Here Boucher lived through his thirties.\n\nMadame was a pretty creature, if we had but Latour's pastel portrait\nalone to prove it. But the pretty features were the crown to as pretty\na body, for she sat often to her lord; and it is clear from his\ncorrespondence with a friend, Bachaumont, that she is the Psyche of\nhis illustrated fable--and Psyche runs much to the Altogether.\n\nMarriage, however, was not likely to imprison Boucher's gadding eyes;\nand it did not. Madame Boucher seems to have had as frail a heart, and\navoided strife by amusing herself, amongst others, with the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who, to gain access to the lady,\ncommissioned Boucher to do the Watteau-like illustrations to\nAcajou--a dull affair. Boucher's pretty wife, herself no mean\nartist, worked in his studio, and painted several smaller canvases\nafter his pictures, gaining some fame as a miniaturist and engraver.\n\nNor did Marriage turn Boucher from his art. Two years were gone by\nsince his nomination to the Academy; he had now to paint the formal\nHistorical Picture and present it in order to take his seat as\nAcademician; and it was in this his thirtieth year that he painted and\nwon his academic rank with the \"Renauld et Armide\" now at the Louvre.\n\nHere he sufficiently subordinated his own style to the academic to\nensure success; and the work was hailed by Academicians and critics,\nincluding Diderot, with enthusiasm. But even here we have his cupids\npeeping round the mythologic event; and Armide herself has pretty\nFrench lips that knew no Greek.\n\nOnce secure of his position, he straightway flung the last remnants of\nthe academic style out of his studio door; and it is a grim comment on\ncriticism that it was just exactly in proportion as he developed his\nown personal genius and uttered the France of his day, that he was\nattacked; whilst the stilted things that he knew were third-rate, and\nwhich he wholly rejected from henceforth, were exactly the things that\nwere praised!\n\nHis election to the Academy, and the enthusiasm over the picture that\nwon him his seat thereat, brought his name before the young king; the\nfollowing year he received his first order from the Court whose\npainter he was destined to become. The decorations in the queen's\napartments were gloomy and had grown black; and he painted in their\nstead the \"Charity,\" \"Abundance,\" \"Fidelity,\" and \"Prudence\" still\nthere to be seen. Indeed, with his gay vision, his pretty habit of\nculling only the flowers from the garden of life, and his quickness to\nset down the pleasing thing in every prospect, Boucher was the\ndestined painter of a Court weary of pomposity and the pose of the\nmock-heroic, and which was wholly giving itself up to pleasure and the\nelegances.\n\nBut neither his new dignity of Academician nor the royal favour, kept\nhim from the bookshops; and he illustrated, with rare beauty and a\ncharm worthy of Watteau, the great edition of the Works of Moli\u00e8re\nin his thirty-first year. It is true that he made as free with\nMoli\u00e8re's world as with the Gods of Olympus; he peoples the plays with\ncharacters of his own day, arrayed in the dress and habit of that day,\nand moving in surroundings that he saw about him.\n\n\nLE MONDE QUI S'AMUSE\n\n\nThe Homely had come upon the town out of Holland, painted with most\nconsummate artistry by Chardin, and was soon in the vogue. Boucher had\na quick eye for the mode. And he straightway set himself to the\npainting of \"La Belle Cuisini\u00e8re.\" Still-life and homely subjects need\nan accuracy of realism and a Dutch sense of these things, a sense of\nsincerity and an appreciation of the dignity of the work-a-day life of\nthe people, in which Boucher was wholly lacking. Above all, it calls\nfor a sense of \"character,\" which, in Boucher, was always weak. It was\na sneer against him that his very broomsticks called for pompons and\nribbons--and there was more than a little truth in the spite. He is\nmore concerned with the accident of the kissing of a kitchen-maid than\nwith the kitchen's habit. He cannot even peep into a scullery without\ndragging in Venus by the skirts, and tricking her out in a\nproperty-wardrobe of a scullery-wench, in which the girl is clearly\nbut acting the part.\n\nHowever, these passing vogues and experiments in different methods\nwere only gay asides--he was working the while upon his own subjects;\nand, to the display by its several members ordered by the Academy, he\nsent four little paintings of fauns and cupids which won him the\nhonour of election as deputy-professor. His brain and hand were very\nbusy, and he turns from one thing to another with amazing facility,\nbringing distinction to all that he does.\n\nBut he painted about this time two pictures of infants, \"L'Amour\nOiseleur\" and \"L'Amour Moissonneur,\" which were the beginning of that\nhost of cupids that he let fly from his studio; they frolic across his\ncanvases and join the retinue of Venus, peeping out from clouds, over\nwaves, round curtains, painted with a perfection that has never been\nsurpassed in the portrayal of infants. He painted their round limbs,\ntheir lusty life, their delightful awkwardnesses, their jolly fat\ngrace, their na\u00efve surprise at life and glory in it, as they had never\nbeen painted before, and have never been painted since.\n\nHe also gave forth in this his thirty-third year a \"Pastoral\" and a\n\"Shepherd and Shepherdess in Conversation,\" with sheep about them and\nin a pleasant landscape, which were his first essays in the style that\nhe created and which made him famous.\n\nHis friend Meissonnier, the inventor of the rococo, stood godfather to\nBoucher's first-born son in the May of 1736.\n\nFrom the very beginning Boucher seems to have been engraved. And these\nengravings, done by the best gravers of his day, greatly extended his\nreputation and popularised him; he fully realised the value of the\nadvertisement as well as his profits from it. Before his thirty-third\nyear was run out he published his well-known \"Cries of Paris.\"\n\nBoucher's description of them, \"studies from the low classes,\" holds\nthe key to that something of failure to realise the dramatic verities\nthat is over all; it gives also the attitude of the France that he\nknew towards the France that he did not, and could not understand. He\ncreated that dainty, pleasant atmosphere that comes floating up to the\nwindows on a fresh morning in Paris from the musical cries of\nthe street vendors; but of the deeper significance of the\nstreet-sellers--of the miserable accent in their life, of their weary\ntoil, of the dignity of their labour--he knew nothing; his brush could\nnot refrain from making elegance and fine manners peep from behind the\nstreet-porter's fustian or the milkmaid's skirt.\n\nBut his thirty-third year was to contain a more far-reaching\nsignificance even than the creation of his cupid-pieces and pastorals.\n\nThe \"Cries of Paris\" were scarce printed when Boucher's illustration\nto \"Don Quixote\" appeared--\"Sancho pursued by the servants of the\nDuke.\" This design was to have far-reaching results that Boucher\nlittle suspected.\n\nThe painter Oudry had been called to the conduct of the great tapestry\nlooms at Beauvais a couple of years before; and in his efforts to\nfurnish the looms with good designs, he now called Boucher to his aid,\nwhose original and fresh style, colour, and arrangement, together with\nhis personal vision, and the enthusiasm and zeal with which he threw\nhimself into the work, at once increased the reputation and the\nproducts of the famous looms. This large designing for the tapestries\nwas, in return, of immense value to the development of the genius of\nthe man, enlarging his breadth of style and giving scope to that great\ndecorative sense that was his superb gift. Thenceforth he was destined\nto play a supreme part in the history of the world-famed factories. He\nnow produced painting after painting for the Beauvais looms.\n\nLife is now one long triumph for Boucher, only disturbed in this year\nby the sad news of the suicide of his old master, Lemoyne. It was in\nthis, Boucher's thirty-fourth year, that the Salon was opened for the\nfirst time since Boucher's infancy, and he contributed several\ncanvases to it.\n\nRigaud, the old Academician, now close upon eighty, straggling through\nthe great galleries, might well blink and gasp at the change that had\ncome over French art since he last exhibited there, thirty-three years\ngone by; but his scoffs and regrets held no terrors for the younger\nAcademicians gathered about. He stood in a new world. A new generation\nwas in possession. The grand manner, the severe etiquette, formal\nmock-heroics, and solemn pomposity of Louis the Fourteenth were\nvanished, and the Agreeable and the Pleasant Make-Believe of Louis the\nFifteenth reigned in their stead. Old Rigaud might blink indeed! Just\nas the imposing and stilted etiquette of the reception-room had given\nplace to the easy manners and airy etiquette of the dainty boudoir, so\nhad light chatter and gay wit and the quick repartee usurped the heavy\nsplendours of a consequential age. France, weary of an eternal pose of\nthe grand manner, was seeking change in joyousness and amusement.\n\nGallantry and gaiety were become the object of the ambition of a\ndandified and elegant day. France became a coquette; dressed herself\nas a porcelain shepherdess; and with beribboned crook and sheep,\nseeking pleasant prospects to stroll through, gave herself to\ndalliance--her powder-puff and patch-box and fan a serious part of her\nunseriousness.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE CH\u00c2TEAUROUX\n\n\nAt thirty-five Boucher has arrived. He is in the vogue; in favour at\nCourt--as well as in the fashion. In his three years from taking his\nseat at the Academy to the opening of the first Salon he has created a\nnew and original style--his cupid pieces, his pastorals, his\nVenus-pieces, his tapestry. Boucher's kingdom lay in the realm of the\ndecorative painter--and he has found it. Torn from the surroundings\nfor which he designed them, as part and parcel of the general scheme,\nhis pictures are as out of place as an Italian altarpiece in an\nEnglish dining-room, yet they suffer less. Several may still be seen,\nas he set them up in frames of his own planning, as overdoors in the\npalace of the Soubise, now given up to the national archives.\n\nThe ghost of the Prince of Soubise, who commissioned them, may haunt\nhis palace, but his kin know the place no longer. The overdoors\nwrought by Boucher's skill look down now on the nation's collection of\nhistoric documents. The \"Three Graces enchaining Love,\" the fine\npastoral of \"The Cage,\" and the pastoral of the \"Shepherd placing a\nRose in his Shepherdess's Hair,\" were to see a mightier change than\nthe usurpation of Louis the Fourteenth's pompous age by the elegant\nyears of Louis the Fifteenth. But this was not as yet. Here at least\nwe see Boucher's art rid of all outside influences, and at the full\ntide of creation; here we have the inimitable lightness of touch, the\nfigures and landscape bathed in the airy volume of atmosphere.\n\nHe seems at this time to have played with pastel, due probably to his\nfriendship with Latour, who sent a portrait of Boucher's wife to this\nSalon. Boucher showed in the use of chalks the artistry and skill that\nwere always at his command.\n\nHe also was putting to its full use his innate sense of landscape,\nraising to high achievement that astonishing balance of landscape and\nfigures in his design--a balance that has never been surpassed; his\nfigures never override his landscape; his landscape never overpowers\nhis figures. His earnest counsels to his pupils and his constant\ndeploring of the lack of the landscape art in France prove the great\nstress he laid upon it.\n\nThe designing of a frontispiece for the catalogue of a personal\nfriend, one Gersaint, a merchant of oriental wares, started Boucher in\nhis thirty-third year upon that series of Chinese pictures and\ntapestries known as the \"Chinoiseries,\" in which he frittered away\nonly too many precious hours, for they were received with great favour\nby the public. The paintings of Chinese subjects designed for the\nlooms of Beauvais are still to be seen at Besan\u00e7on.\n\nBut busy as were his brain and hand in the exercise of his wide and\nversatile gifts, pouring out \"Chinoiseries,\" illustrations for books,\ntapestries on a large scale, landscapes, models for the gilt bronze\ndecorations of porcelain vases, scheming handsome frames for his\npictures, designing furniture and fans--Boucher was true, above all,\n\"to his goddess,\" and painted the famed \"Birth of Venus,\" which,\nthanks to the Swedish Ambassador's fondness for Madame Boucher, now\nhangs at Stockholm; our amorous Count de Tessin, to be just, seems to\nhave had a rare flair for the artistic--besides artist's wives. It was\non the 15th of April in 1742, the last year of his thirties, that the\nRoyal favour was marked by the grant of a pension of 400 livres\n(double florins) to Boucher with promise of early benefits to follow.\n\nTwo years afterwards it was raised to 600 livres.\n\nThis was the year that he painted the beautiful canvas of \"Diana\nleaving the Bath with one of her Companions,\" now at the Louvre. It\nwas also the year that saw his landscape, the \"Hamlet of Iss\u00e9\" at the\nSalon. This \"Hameau d'Iss\u00e9\" was to be enlarged for the Opera, proving\nhim to be decorator there, where he was arranging waterfalls,\ncascades, and the rest of the pretty business, without staying his\nhand from his art.\n\nAt forty Boucher has come into his kingdom. The ten years of these\nforties were to be a vast triumph for him. He was to produce\nmasterpiece after masterpiece. His art had caught the taste of the\nday. He was at the height of his powers. He had done great things--he\nwas to do greater. During these ten years of his forties he poured\nforth vivid and glowing works of sustained power and originality.\n\nWe have a picture of him as he was in the flesh at this time--the\npastel portrait by Lundberg, now at the Louvre--a gay, somewhat\ndissipated, handsomely dressed dandy of the time, smiling out of his\ncareless day, the debonnair man of fashion, the laughing eyes showing\nsigns of the night carousals, which were the rest from the prodigious\ntoil of this vital and forthright spirit.\n\nIt was in this our artist's fortieth year that the gifted old Cardinal\nFleury, who had guided the fortunes of France with rare skill, died,\nbroken by his ninety years and the blunders of the disastrous war that\nhe had so strenuously opposed; and Louis, essaying the strut of\nkingship, became king by act. His indolent character, unequal to the\nmighty business, his indeterminate will fretted by the set of\nquarrelling and intriguing rogues that he gathered about him as his\nministers, he fell into the habit that became his thenceforth, the\nonly thing to which he paid the tribute of constancy--he ruled France\nfrom behind pretty petticoats. He had early shown the adulterous blood\nof his great-grandfather; two, if not three, of five sisters of the\nnoble and historic house of De Nesle had yielded to his gadding fancy;\nthe youngest now ousted her sister De Mailly from the king's favour,\nwas publicly acknowledged as the king's mistress, and became Duchess\nof Ch\u00e2teauroux. Boucher painted her handsome being as a shepherdess in\none of his pastorals. She was no ordinary toy of a king. A woman of\ntalent, with hot ambitions for the king's majesty, fired with the\npride of race of the old French noblesse, it was during her short\nyears of ascendancy over the king that he roused from his body's\ntorpor and made an effort to reach the dignity and eminence befitting\nto the lord of a great and gallant people. He stepped forth awhile\nfrom his drunken bouts and manifold mean adulteries, and set himself\nat the head of the army in Flanders, and strutted it as conqueror.\n\nPoor Ch\u00e2teauroux only got the hate of the people for reward, Louis the\nhonours; for the people resented the public dishonour of her state.\n\nPower she found to be a dead-sea apple in her pretty mouth. The glory\nof it all, the splendours, were not the easily won delights for which\nshe had looked. She had to fight a duel, that never ended, with the\nking's witty, crafty, and scurrilous Prime Minister, the notorious\nMaurepas--and Maurepas willed that no woman should ever come between\nhim and the king--Maurepas who knew no mercy, no decency, no chivalry,\nno scruple. At Ch\u00e2teauroux's urging, Louis placed himself at the\nhead of the army; and France went near mad with joy that she had\nagain found a king. Crafty Maurepas urged on the business; the\nCh\u00e2teauroux suddenly realised his cunning glee--it separated her from\nthe king.\n\nOut of the whirl of things Boucher's fortune was ripening, little as\nhe might suspect it.\n\nHe was painting masterpieces that make his name live. To his fortieth\nyear belong the famed \"Birth of Venus,\" the \"Venus leaving the Bath,\"\nthe \"Muse Clio,\" the \"Muse Melpomene,\" and the three well-known\npastorals now at the Louvre--\"The Sleeping Shepherdess,\" the \"Nest,\"\n\n\nand the \"Shepherd and Shepherdesses.\" Of the many famous Venus-pieces\nthat his hand painted during these years it is not easy to write the\nlist. But having signed the \"Marriage of Love and Psyche\" at\nforty-one, he turned his experimental hand to the homely, realistic\nDutch style that was having a wide vogue, and painted the\n\"Dejeuner\"--a family of the prosperous class of the day at\nbreakfast--showing with rare charm the surroundings and home life of\nthe well-to-do of his time.\n\nAll goes well with Boucher. He changes into better quarters in the Rue\nde Grenelle-Saint-Honor\u00e9, where he lived for the next five years,\nuntil 1749; but his eyes are fixed upon a studio and apartments at\nthe old palace of the Louvre, though the hard intriguing of his\npowerful friends at Court on his behalf failed for some time. He had,\nindeed, to make another move before he arrived at his longed-for goal.\n\nPensions Boucher, like others, had found to be somewhat empty affairs;\nbut rooms at the Louvre were a solid possession eagerly sought after\nby the artists.\n\nIn this year of 1744 Boucher created a new fashion at the annual Salon\nby sending studies and sketches instead of finished pictures; and it\nset a value upon such things not before realised by artists, for\nsuccess was instant and loud.\n\nTowards the end of the next, Boucher's forty-second year, the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who was to take his leave of Paris,\ncommissioned four pictures to represent the day of a woman of fashion,\nand to be entitled \"Morning,\" \"Midday,\" \"Evening,\" and \"Night.\"\n\nBoucher painted one of these for him, now known as the \"Marchande de\nModes.\" The others were painted later, and all had a wide vogue as\nengravings. The correspondence has interest since it reveals Boucher's\nbusiness habits; he was paid for a picture on its delivery, and for\neach of these he was to receive 600 livres (double florins or\ndollars)--about a hundred and twenty pounds.\n\nIn an official document of the Director of Buildings to the king (or\nMinister of Fine Art, as we should say), written in this year of 1745,\nBoucher being forty-two, is a \"list of the best painters,\" in which\nBoucher is singled out for distinction as \"an historic painter, living\nin the Rue de Grenelle-Saint-Honor\u00e9, opposite the Rue des Deux-Ecus,\npupil of Lemoyne, excelling also in landscape, grotesques, and\nornaments in the manner of Watteau; and equally skilled in painting\nflowers, fruit, architecture, and subjects of gallantry and of\nfashion.\"\n\nNot so bad for dry officialdom; the critics could learn a lesson. For\nhe was nothing less. What indeed does he not do? and wondrous well!\nthis painter of the age.\n\nAnd the mighty rush of events is about to sweep him into further\nprominence; the very things which he probably passed by with a gay\nshrug are to enrich him, to help him to his highest fulfilment.\n\nPoor Ch\u00e2teauroux saw that she must lose the king's gadding favour in\nthe conflict with Maurepas unless she joined her lord, now with the\narmy. She realised full well that she had created the new Louis of\nAmbition--that her going must bring the people's hate to her. But she\ndared not lose the king. And she went. Maurepas had overdone his\njibings. The indiscretion at once rang through the land; became the\njest of the army--and Maurepas was not far from the bottom of the\nbusiness. The discreet indiscretion of covered ways between the king's\nlodgings and hers only added to the mockeries, and increased the\npeople's hate against, of course, the Ch\u00e2teauroux. Then upon a day in\nAugust the small-pox seized Louis at Metz; poor Ch\u00e2teauroux fought for\npossession of the king in the sick room, until his fear of\ndeath--Louis' sole piety--sent her packing--shrinking back in the\nhired carriage at each halting-place for change of horses, lest she\nshould be seen and torn from her place and destroyed by the populace.\n\nBut Louis recovered; Paris rang with bells at joy on his recovery, and\nhe entered the city amidst mad enthusiasm, hailed as The Well-Beloved.\n\nHe sent for the Ch\u00e2teauroux to find her dying, Maurepas having to\ndeliver the message of recall. She died suddenly and in great agony,\nswearing that Maurepas had poisoned her--died in the arms of her poor\ndiscarded sister, the De Mailly.\n\nBut this year of 1745 Boucher hears a mightier scandal that is to mean\nvast things to all France--and not least of all to Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE POMPADOUR\n\n\nA young bride had become the gossip of the rich merchant society of\nParis--that class that was ousting the old noblesse from power. She\nwas a beautiful, a remarkable woman; her wit was repeated in the\ndrawing-rooms, she had all the accomplishments; her charming\nname--Madame Lenormant d'Etioles.\n\nDraw aside the curtains of the past and we discover our little Jeanne\nPoisson--grown into this exquisite creature. It has come about in\nstrange fashion enough. The father--a scandalous fellow--having\nfingered the commissariat moneys in ugly ways to his own use, had been\nbanished for the ugly business. Nor is Jeanne's mother any better than\nshe should be; and the wags wink knowingly at the handsome and rich\nman of fashion, Monsieur Lenormant de Tournehem, who has been the\nfavoured gallant during the absence of the light-fingered Poisson.\n\nAnd, of a truth, Lenormant de Tournehem takes astonishing interest in\nthe little Jeanne--watching over her up-growing and giving her the\nbest of education at the convent, where she wins all hearts, and is\nknown as \"the little queen.\" The truth spoken with wondrous prophecy,\nif unthinkingly, as we shall see. Complacent Poisson came home, and\ntook the rich and fashionable, bland and smiling Lenormant de\nTournehem to his arms. Has he not wealth and estates? therefore as\nexcellent a friend for Poisson as for Madame Poisson. The girl Jeanne\nleaves the convent to be taught the accomplishments by the supreme\nmasters of France, the wits foregather at Madame Poisson's, and the\nbrilliant Jeanne is soon mistress of the arts--coquetry not least of\nall; has also the most exquisite taste in dress. Under all is a heart\ncold as steel; calculating as the higher mathematics. She has but one\nhindrance to ambition--her mean birth. Lenormant de Tournehem rids her\neven of this slur by making his nephew, Lenormant d'Etioles, marry\nher, giving the young couple half his fortune for dowry, and the\npromise of the rest when he dies--also he grants him a splendid\ntown-house, as splendid a country seat. And consequential\nself-respecting little Lenormant d'Etioles is lord of Etioles, amongst\nother seignories. So Jane Fish appears as Madame Lenormant d'Etioles,\nseductive, beautiful, accomplished, to whose house repair the new\nphilosophy, the wits, and artists. She has a certain sense of virtue;\nindeed openly vows that no one but the king shall ever come between\nher and her lord. But, deep in her heart, she has harboured a fierce\nambition--that the king shall help her to keep her bond. She puts\nforth all her gifts, all her powers, to win to the strange goal;\nconfides it to her worldly mother and \"uncle,\" Lenormant de Tournehem;\nfinds keen allies therein to the reaching of that strange goal. The\ndeath of the Ch\u00e2teauroux clears the way. At a masked ball the king is\nintrigued as to the personality of a beautiful woman who plagues him\nwith her art; he orders the unmasking. Madame Lenormant d'Etioles\nstands revealed, drops her handkerchief as by accident; the whisper\nruns through the Court that \"the handkerchief has been thrown!\" The\nking stoops and picks it up. A few evenings later she is smuggled into\nthe \"private apartments.\" She goes again a month later; in the morning\nis seized with sudden terror--she daren't go back to her angry lord\nlest he do her grievous harm; he will have missed her. The king is\ntouched; allows her to hide from henceforth in the secret apartments;\npromises the beautiful creature a lodging, her husband's banishment,\nand early acknowledgment as titular mistress--before the whole Court\nat Easter, says the pious Great One. But he has to join the army to\nplay the Conqueror at Fontenoy; and it is later in the year\n(September) before Madame d'Etioles is presented to the Court in a\nvast company and proceeds to the queen's apartments to kiss hands on\nappointment. Thus was Jeanne Poisson raised to the great aristocracy\nof France in her twenty-third year as Marquise de Pompadour.\n\nBoucher had been one of the brilliant group of artists of the\nd'Etioles' circle. That the Pompadour's influence had much effect upon\nhis position at Court for a year or two is unlikely; for she had to\nfight for possession of the king day and night, as the Ch\u00e2teauroux\nhad done, against the queen's party and the unscrupulous enmity of\nMaurepas. To set down Boucher's favour at Court to her is ridiculous.\n\nHe was painting for the queen's apartments at thirty-one when the\nPompadour was a school-girl of twelve. But in the year following her\nrise to power, Boucher painted four pictures for the large room of the\nDauphin, which were \"placed elsewhere\"; and, the year after that, he\nwas at work upon two pictures for the bedroom of the king at the\ncastle of Marly. It is likely enough that the Pompadour directed this\norder. She had almost immediately secured the office of the\nDirector-General of Buildings, which covered the direction of the\nroyal art treasures, for \"uncle\" Lenormant de Tournehem, who was also\na friend of the artist. And from this year it is significant that\nBoucher paints no more for the opposing camp of the Queen and Dauphin.\n\nHe was now giving all his strength to the \"Rape of Europa\" that he\npainted for the competition ordered by the Academy at the command of\nLenormant de Tournehem in the king's name, in which ten chosen\nAcademicians were to paint subjects in their own style for six prizes\nand a gold medal, to be awarded in secret vote by the competing\nartists themselves. Boucher won, by his amiable nature, the good-will\nof them all by proposing that they should so arrange as to share the\nprizes equally, and thus prevent any sense of soreness inevitable in\nthe losers.\n\nBut greatly as he won the good-fellowship of his fellow-artists by it,\nthis picture caused a murmur to rise amongst the critics who,\naforetime loud in his praise, now began to complain of his \"abuse of\nrose tints\" in the painting of the female nude. The fact was that\nDiderot and the men of the New Philosophy were turning their eyes to\nthe whole foundations upon which France was built, art as well as\nsociety, and were beginning to demand of art \"grandeur and morality in\nits subjects.\" They were soon to be clamouring for \"the statement of a\ngreat maxim, a lesson for the spectator.\" Diderot, with bull-like\ncourage, picked out the greatest, and turned upon Boucher, blaming him\nfor triviality.\n\nThe nations, weary of war, concluded the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in\nthe October of 1748. No sooner was peace concluded than Louis\nrelapsed into his old habit of dandified indolence and profligate\nease; and, putting from him his duties as the lord of a great people,\nhe gave himself up to shameless intrigues. He allowed the Pompadour to\nusurp his magnificence and to rule over the land. He yielded himself\nutterly, if sometimes sulkily, to her domination; and for sixteen\nyears she was the most powerful person at Court, the greatest force in\nthe state--making and unmaking ministers, disposing of office,\nhonours, titles, pensions. All political affairs were discussed and\narranged under her guidance; ministers, ambassadors, generals\ntransacted their business in her stately boudoirs; the whole patronage\nof the sovereign was dispensed by her pretty hands; the prizes of the\nChurch, of the army, of the magistracy could be obtained solely\nthrough her favour and good-will. Her energy must have been\nprodigious. Possessed of extraordinary talents and exquisite tastes,\nshe gave full rein to them, and it was in the indulgence of her better\nqualities that Destiny brought Boucher into the friendship of this\nwonderful woman. She became not only his patron but his pupil,\nengraving several of his designs.\n\nBut this, her sovereignty over the king, easy and light in its outward\nseeming, was a haggard nightmare to the calculating woman who had so\nlonged for it. She knew no single hour's rest from the night she won\nto the king's bed. She had to fight her enemies, secret and open, for\npossession of the king's will, day and night; and she fought--with\nrare courage. She won by consummate skill and unending pluck. She made\nherself an essential part of the king's freedom from care. The Court\nparty fought her for power with constant vigilance. Maurepas brought\nall his unscrupulous art, all his ironic mimicry, all his vile jibes\nand unchivalrous hatred to bear against her. He had made himself a\nnecessity to the king; and he never slept away a chance of injuring\nher. He knew no mercy, no nobility, no pity. He made her the detested\nobject of the people. With his own hands he penned the witty verses\nand epigrams that were sung and flung about the streets of Paris.\n\nBut she had an enemy more subtle than any at the Court--hour by hour\nshe had to dispute the king with the king's boredom. And it was in the\neffort to do so that she created her celebrated theatre in the\nprivate apartments, calling Boucher and others to her aid in the doing\nof it. Here the noblest of France vied with each other to obtain the\nsmallest part to play, an instrument in its orchestra, an invitation\nto its performances.\n\nBoucher left the Opera to become its decorator in 1748, and did not\nreturn until her death. For her, he also decorated her beautiful rooms\nat Bellevue. She bought at high prices many of his greatest\nmasterpieces.\n\nThe Pompadour's power so greatly increased that she openly took\ncommand of the king's will; dared and succeeded in getting his\nfavourite Maurepas banished; and herself took to the use of the kingly\n\"we.\" Her rascally father was created Lord of Marigny; her brother,\nwhom the king liked well and called \"little brother,\" was created\nMarquis de Vandi\u00e8res; her only child, Alexandrine, signed her name as\na princess of the blood royal, and would have been married to the\nblood royal had she not caught the small-pox and died. She amassed a\nprivate fortune, castles, and estates such as no mistress had dreamed\nof; and into them she poured art treasures that cost the nation\nthirty-six millions of money. She created the porcelain factory of\nS\u00e8vres, kept keen watch over the Gobelins looms, and founded the great\nMilitary School of St. Cyr amidst work that would have kept several\nstatesmen busy, and of deadly intrigues at Court that would have\nbroken the spirit of many a brilliant man.\n\nIt was in her hectic desire to keep the king from being bored that she\nstooped, and made Boucher stoop, to the employment of his high\nartistry in the painting of a series of indecent pictures wherewith to\ntickle the jaded desires of Boredom, and thereby gave rise to the\nwidespread impression that Boucher's art was ever infected by base\ndesign. But Boucher was, at his very worst, but a healthy animal; and\neven in these secret works for the king he did not reach so low as did\nmany an artist of more pious memory who painted with no excuse but his\nown pleasure.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the Pompadour has been blamed too much for this\nevil act, and too much forgotten for her splendid patronage of the man\nwho, under it and during these great years of his forties, produced a\nseries of masterpieces that place him in the foremost rank of the\npainters of his century. It is impossible to reckon the number of the\npastorals and Venus-pieces that his master-hand painted and loved to\npaint, during these the supreme years of his genius. It is significant\nthat they were painted during the years that saw the Pompadour in\nsupreme power.\n\nBoucher was so firmly established in 1750, his forty-seventh year,\nthat he moved into a new house in the Rue Richelieu, near the Palais\nRoyal. Disappointed in not receiving a studio and apartments at the\nLouvre, he was allowed to use a studio in the king's library. He was\nnow making money so easily that he was able to collect pictures and\nprecious stones and the gaily coloured curiosities that appealed to\nhis tastes.\n\nThe critics were becoming more and more censorious; and one of them\nhits true with the comment that in his pastorals his shepherdesses\nlook as if they had stepped over from the Opera and would soon be off\nagain thereto.\n\nIn his forty-eighth year Boucher's art was at its most luminous\nstage--his atmosphere clear and subtle and exquisitely rendered; his\nyellows golden; his whites satin-like and silvery; his flesh-tones\nupon the nude bodies of his goddesses unsurpassed by previous art. The\nbeauty of it all was not to last much longer.\n\nLenormant de Tournehem died suddenly in the November of 1751; the\nPompadour's brother, Abel Poisson de Vandi\u00e8res, was appointed\nDirector-General in his stead at the age of twenty-five--and soon\nafterwards, on the death of his father, created Marquis de Marigny--a\nshy, handsome youth, a gentleman and an honourable fellow, whom the\nking liked well, and against whom his sister's sole complaint was that\nhe lacked the brazen effrontery of the courtiers of the day. No man\ndid more for the advancement of the art of his time. A pension of a\nthousand livres falling vacant, the young fellow secured it for\nBoucher; and almost immediately afterwards, a studio becoming vacant\nat the Louvre owing to the death of Coypel, first painter to the king,\nBoucher came to his coveted home, eagerly moving in with his family as\nsoon as its wretched state could be put into repair.\n\nThe decoration of the new wing to the palace at Fontainebleau brought\nthe commission for the painting of the ceiling and the principal\npicture in the Council Chamber to Boucher, who had already decorated\nthe Dining-Room. This was the period of his painting the \"Rising\" and\nthe \"Setting of the Sun\" for the Pompadour, now in the Watteau\ncollection, two canvases that were always favourites with the painter,\nbitterly as they were assailed by the critic Grimm.\n\nHe was turning out so much work that it was impossible to give as much\ncare to his pictures as he ought. For he refused sternly, his life\nlong, to raise his prices; by consequence he had to create a larger\namount of work in order to meet his expenditure. It was about this\ntime that Reynolds, passing through Paris, went to visit him and found\nhim painting on a huge canvas without models or sketches. \"On\nexpressing my surprise,\" writes Reynolds, \"he replied that he had\nconsidered the model as necessary during his youth until he had\ncompleted his study of art, but that he had not used one for a long\ntime past.\"\n\nHe soon had not the time, not only to paint from nature but even to\ngive his pictures the work necessary to complete them. The feverish\nhaste which took possession of him in his frantic endeavour to meet\nthe vast demand for his pictures, and the eager efforts of his\nengravers to satisfy the public call for engravings after his works,\ngave him less and less leisure to joy in their doing. And his eyesight\nbegan to fail. His flesh-tints deepened to a reddish hue; and he\nstands baffled before his work, suspecting his sight, since what every\none cries out upon as being bright vermilion, he only sees as a dull\nearthy colour. Boucher has topped the height of his achievement; he\nhas to \"descend the other side of the hill.\" Boucher begins to grow\nold.\n\nIn Boucher's fifty-first year an ugly intrigue of the queen's party at\nCourt to sap the Pompadour's influence over the king by drawing away\nthe king's affections towards Madame de Choiseul-Romanet, a reckless\nyoung beauty of the Court, brought about a strange alliance. The Count\nde Stainville, one of the Pompadour's bitterest enemies, was shown the\nking's letter of invitation to his young kinswoman; and he, deeply\nwounded in his pride that his kinswoman should have been offered to\nthe king, went to the Pompadour and exposed the plot. A close\nalliance followed; and De Stainville thenceforth became her chief\nguide in affairs of state. It was at her instance that the king called\nhim to be his Prime Minister, raising him to the Duchy of Choiseul--a\nname he made illustrious as one of the greatest Ministers of France.\n\nIn his fifty-second year Boucher was appointed to the directorship of\nthe Gobelins looms, to the huge delight of the weavers and all\nconcerned with the tapestry factory. This was the year of his painting\nthe famous portrait of the Pompadour, to whom he several times paid\nthis \"tribute of immorality.\" For the Gobelins looms he produced many\nhandsome designs; and he was painting with astounding industry. But\nhis hand's skill began to falter. His art shows weariness in his\nsixtieth year, and sickness fell upon him, and held him in servitude\nnow with rare moments of respite. The critics, notoriously Diderot,\nwere now attacking him with shameless virulence. Boucher passed it all\nby; but he felt the change that was taking place in the public taste.\n\nThe ideas of the New Philosophy were infecting public opinion; the Man\nof Feeling had arisen in the land; and France, humiliated in war, and\nresenting the follies and the greed of her shameless privileged class,\nwas openly resenting it and all its works. Choiseul had planted his\nstrength deep in the people's party, and was come near to being its\ngod. His masterly mind had checked Frederick of Prussia to the North;\nand the nations, exhausted by the struggle, signed the Peace of Paris\nin 1763. Choiseul, with France at peace abroad, turned to the blotting\nout of the turbulent order of the Jesuits at home. Their attempt to\nend the Pompadour's relations with the king made this powerful woman\neager to complete his design; the chance was soon to come, and the\nOrder was abolished from France and its vast property seized by the\nstate.\n\nThe Pompadour lived but a short while to enjoy her triumph. Worn out\nby her superhuman activities, assailed by debt, she fell ill of a\nracking cough, dying on the 15th of April, 1764, in her forty-second\nyear, keeping her ascendancy over the king and the supreme power in\nFrance to her last hour. Death found her transacting affairs of state.\n\nLouis, weary of his servitude, had only a heartless epigram to cast\nat the body of the dead woman as she passed to her last resting-place.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE END\n\n\nThe death of the Pompadour robbed Boucher of a friend; but her\nbrother, Marigny, remained faithfully attached to the old artist, and\nseized every chance to honour him. On the death of Carle van Loo,\nBoucher, at sixty-two, was made first painter to the king, with all\nhis pensions and privileges that were consistent with this the supreme\nappointment in the art world.\n\nThere had been serious intention of making Boucher the head of the\nEcole des El\u00e8ves Proteg\u00e9s; he had the art of making himself liked and\nof inspiring the love of the arts. He was very popular with the\nstudents and artists, owing to his kindliness, his eagerness to render\nservice, his readiness to encourage the youngsters or to console them.\n\nWhen the riot took place, provoked by the Academicians by their award\nof the Prix de Rome in 1767, the students insulted the Academicians,\nbut hailed Boucher with enthusiastic applause. The reason was not far\nto seek. When a student came to the old master for advice he did not\n\"play the pontiff,\" and, scorning the false dignity of big phrases, he\ntook the brush in his hand and showed the way out of all difficulties\nby simplehearted example, despising rules, and putting himself out in\norder to make things clear to a young artist.\n\nHowever, the Academicians feared he would be an unorthodox master for\nyouth, and appointed another in his place.\n\nA long and serious illness thwarted his keen energies. Diderot was\ngiving himself up to outrageous violence against him. If the old\npainter exhibited at the Salon, Diderot fiercely assailed his art; if\nhe did not exhibit, Diderot as bitterly assailed him for his\nnegligences. Above all, he attacked Boucher in that he did not paint\nwhat Diderot would have painted--but could not. \"When he paints\ninfants,\" cries Diderot, \"you will not find one employed in a real act\nof life--studying his lesson, reading, writing, stripping hemp.\"\n\nPoor unfortunate infants! for whom Philosophy could find no happier\njoy in life than stripping hemp! Boucher was but an artist. He\npainted his generation as far as he could see it, and, with all his\nfaults and weaknesses, he never debauched his art with foreign and\nalien things that had no part in the nation's life; he painted fair\nFrance into his landscapes, not a make-believe land he did not know\nwith preposterous Greek ruins; and best of all, to his eternal honour,\nhe painted infants glad in their gladness to be alive, with no desire\nto send their happy little bodies to school, with no sickly ambition\nto make them into budding philosophers, with no thought of making them\npose and lie as Men of Feeling. He had no joy in setting their little\nbodies to toil--in making them \"teach a lesson to the spectator,\" in\nmaking them stoop their little shoulders to the \"picking of hemp.\"\n\nHe continued to paint as he had always painted--except that he painted\nless well. The wreath of roses was wilting on a grey head. The blood\njigged less warmly in the frail body. The features showed pallid--the\neyes haggard. The sight failed. The hand alone kept something of its\ncunning.\n\nHe went to Holland with his friend Randon du Boisset, but health\nshrank farther from him. Diderot had near spent his last jibe.\n\nIn 1768, Boucher's sixty-fifth year, the neglected queen went to her\ngrave. The king's grief and contrition and vows to amend his life came\ntoo late, and lasted little longer than the drying of the floods of\ntears over the body of his dead consort. A year later he was become\nthe creature of a pretty woman of the gutters, whom he caused to be\nmarried to the Count du Barry--the infamously famous Madame du Barry.\n\nBut neither the remonstrances of Choiseul with the king against this\nfurther degradation of the throne of France, nor his unconcealed scorn\nof the upstart countess, nor the dangerous enemy he made for himself\nthereby, signified now to Boucher, first painter to the king.\n\nBoucher was failing. His son was a prig and a disappointment. His two\nfavourite pupils, Baudoin and Deshayes, who had married his two girls,\ndied.\n\nTo the Salon of 1769 he sent his \"Caravan of Bohemians.\" It was his\nlast display. He had been going about for some time like a gaunt ghost\nof his former self, afflicted with all the ills inevitable to a life\nfeverishly consumed in work and the pursuit of pleasure.\n\nThey went to his studio at five of the clock one May morning, and\nfound him seated at his easel, before a canvas of Venus, dead, with\nthe paint-filled brush fallen out of his fingers.\n\nSo passed he away on the 30th of May 1770, in his sixty-seventh year.\n\nWhen Boucher died, the generation of which he was the limner was near\ncome to its violent end. The rosy carnivals and gay gallantries of his\nage gave way to the blood-stained romance and fierce tempest of the\nRevolution. The garrets of the old curiosity-shops received the\ndiscarded canvases of the master. His shepherds and shepherdesses were\nput to rout by the Romans of his pupil, citizen David. The old order\nwas brought into contempt and overthrown. And with it, Boucher's art,\nlike much that was gracious and charming and good in the evil thing,\nwent down also, and was overwhelmed for a while.\n\nFor a while only. For just as, out of the blood and terror of the\nRevolution, a real France arose, phnix-wise, from the ruin, and in\nbeing born, whilst putting off the vilenesses of the thing from which\nshe sprang, took on also to herself the gracious and winsome qualities\nthat place her amongst the most fascinating peoples of the ages; so\nBoucher has come into his kingdom again--the most gracious of painters\nthat the years have yielded."

                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n        a. One bed, or folding cot,\n        b. One oil stove,\n        c. One lamp,\n        d. Enough supplies of all kinds sufficient for six months,\n        e. Pots, pans, kettles, etc.\nIt is needless to say that positions in Manila and Iloilo were now at\na premium.\n\nWas it possible that teachers were to be sent to places where even the\nnecessaries of life could not be obtained! Was it possible that many\nwould be sent to places so remote that for six months no fresh\nsupplies could be gotten! A mass meeting was held at once, and a\ncommittee was appointed to send a cablegram to the Associated Press\npetitioning aid from the American people at large. Realizing what\nconsternation would be created throughout the United States by such a\nmessage, two of the teachers leaped into a carriage at the close of\nthe meeting and a few moments later were closeted with the chief\nexecutive of the department. As a result the committee was persuaded\nnot to send the cablegram to the Associated Press until by courtesy it\nhad been sent to the President. Of course, this diplomatic move tided\naffairs over and the teachers who had flatly refused to budge from\nManila now agreed to go on to their stations, being assured that\nwhatever action was best would be taken.\n\nThe day had come when we must separate. We were to enter an untried\nand an unknown field. It was fitting that we have a final joyous\nmeeting, so the best orchestra in the archipelago was engaged and we\n\"chased the hours with flying feet\" until dawn so that whatever might\ncome to us in that unknown future upon which we were entering each\nwould hold in pleasant memory our last evening together.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER III. - A DRAMA IN ACTUAL LIFE.\n\n\nAlmost every one heeded the warning to go to his station forearmed\nwith at least necessaries of life, but, as it had never fallen to the\nlot of the writer to cook, he refused to learn at that late day, so he\ntook no pot, no pan, no kettle, putting his future into the hands of\nan uncertain fate and relying upon the unknown hospitality of the\nFilipino.\n\nBacalod, the capital of the province of Occidental Negros, was our\ndestination. The second morning after leaving Manila, we awoke with\nthe \"Kilpatrick\" lying at anchor in a shallow bay. We were several\nmiles from the shore and nothing in sight indicated that we had\nreached a place of any importance. Late the night before we had been\nawakened by the loud, sharp ringing of the ship's bells, accompanied\nby the reversal of the engines and a general disturbance awaking the\ncrew. So our first impressions on coming on deck were that we had run\naground. But the captain assured us that everything was ship-shape and\nthat this was the nearest point of approach to Capiz, a town of\nconsiderable importance on the island of Panay, where a body of troops\nwas to embark for home. Not even the grass hut of a native was in\nsight. Search as we would, not a sign was seen of a stream flowing\ninto the sea, indicating the probable presence of a town. There was\nnot a sign of life of any kind save one lone column of thin, blue\nsmoke that arose from the side of a mountain miles away. One would\nhave thought that we were explorers of three hundred years ago lying\noff the shore of some unknown land.\n\nAfter breakfast the steam launch, together with all the boats, was\nlowered, and several of us who had determined to miss no opportunity\nto gather information about the islands took our places in the launch\nby the side of the ship's mate, and steamed away across the water with\na long line of boats strung out in the rear. We headed away toward a\ngroup of cocoanut trees, and about an hour later stepped ashore on a\npile of decayed coral rocks that extended some twenty or thirty feet\nout into the water, thus forming the only landing place of a town of\nseveral thousands of people and of considerable commercial importance.\n\nA few moments after we had landed, an army wagon drawn by a\nmagnificent pair of mules came up out of a tropical jungle along a\nnarrow road. We clambered into the wagon and were soon lost in the\ndepths of foliage from which we had just seen the vehicle emerge.\n\nLong waving bamboos with their plumy leafage hung over the road from\neach side, meeting and overlapping in the center until they formed an\narchway so dense that the tropical sun now high in the heavens\npenetrated it only at intervals. At times the wagon sank up to the\nhubs in the soft earth, and the muscles of the mules stood out like\nwhip-cords under the skin as they drew us forward.\n\nAt a sharp turn in the road we came upon the first division of troops\nthat was to embark for home. The look of joy upon their sun-browned\nfaces was inexpressible. Their work was done, and with elastic step\nand smiling faces they saluted us as they passed by. The reign of\nforce was at an end; it was going out with them; the reign of peace\nhad begun; it was coming in with us.\n\nIn the afternoon when we returned from the town the last of the troops\nhad arrived and, as we drove up, the bugle was sounding the call to\nsupper. We noticed native women mingling with the troops and, indeed,\na native woman was in constant attention waiting upon one of the\nsoldiers with whom we ate. Her clothes were clean, her hair was nicely\ncombed, and her general appearance was neat. She seemed to anticipate\nthe slightest wish of the soldier with whom she was. She brought him\nwater to drink, cleaned his plate after the meal and saw that his\nknife, fork, and spoon were put into his haversack.\n\nWe had now finished supper and the launch had returned for the last\nload of troops. The lieutenant in command of the company gave the\norder to \"fall in\"; the men shouldered their rifles and fell into\nline. \"Forward, march!\" called the lieutenant, and the column swept\nforward towards the boats. The women had until now restrained\nthemselves, but, as their husbands marched away never to return, their\nfeelings could no longer be restrained. One young woman of about\neighteen, who was leaning against a rock by the roadside sobbing, when\nher husband passed, leaped up in frenzy of passionate love and caught\nthe rifle from his shoulder. Her first impulse seemed to be to throw\nthe gun away, but suddenly realizing the futility of such an act she\nburst into tears, shouldered the rifle herself and marched on by his\nside. Another woman of more mature age threw her arms around the legs\nof a tall stalwart man, and drew him bodily from the line.\n\nBut the troops marched on and entered the boats. One woman who had\nbeen unnoticed before came down into the shallow water and caught hold\nof our last boat as if to prevent its leaving, while others stood\nmingling their sobs with the sounds of the wavelets as they broke on\nthe sands. As we passed away, an expectant mother, standing in bold\noutline against the twilight sky, threw up her hands in an agony of\ndespair and then sank upon the stones. The curtain had fallen upon a\ndrama in actual life deeper in pathos than any other we had ever seen\nor ever expected to see. Depth of passion, depth of love! Who can\nfathom the human heart?\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. - WHAT THE TEACHERS DID.\n\n\nThere is a remarkable sameness about the towns in the Philippines.\n\nThey all have a large open square about the middle of the town, around\nthree sides of which are Chinese stores, unless one side lies open to\nthe sea, and on the fourth is the great stone ecclesia. The streets\nrun at right angles to one another and divide up the town into\ncreditable squares.\n\nEverybody in the Philippines lives up-stairs, for the ground is so\nsoaked with water during the rainy season that it is a menace to\nhealth to live upon the ground floor. So even the poorest nippa hut\nis built upon stakes four or five feet above the ground.\n\nBacalod is a typical Philippine town. As we landed, a broad open\nsquare was spread out before us. Two sides of the square were lined\nwith two-story houses in which were Chinese stores below and Filipino\nhomes above. On the third side stood the great stone church in whose\nmassive tower the clock was striking the hour of four, while the\nfourth lay open to the sea that had borne us thither.\n\nWe landed, but it was in a method new to us and one not usually\nemployed by the traveling public.\n\nWhen our sail boat ran aground on the sandy bottom a hundred yards or\nmore from the shore, a crowd of Filipino men who were on the beach\nslowly rolled up their pantaloons and waded out to the rescue,--for\nthe money that was in it. The boat's crew elevated their trousers'\nlegs also and slided down into the water. Each of us then straddled\nthe neck of a Filipino standing in the water and was held by ankles to\nbe steadied while our biped mounts proceeded to the shore.\n\nWe were now on the ground and face to face with the situation. To give\nthe reader an idea of the actual conditions met by the first teachers\nwho went to the Islands, the following is copied from the instructions\ngiven us in Manila:\n    1. There shall be two sessions daily of all schools, and the\n    last hour of the morning session shall be devoted solely to\n    instructing the Filipino teachers.\n\n    2. In cases where teachers are sent to a town in which there\n    is no school-house, they are expected to secure the aid of the\n    people and have one built.\n\n    3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is\n    stopped.\n\n    4. All supplies must be kept under lock and key. In towns\n    where there is no case or box to lock the supplies in, and it\n    is also impossible to get the town council to furnish a case,\n    a requisition may be sent to Manila, and, if an appropriation\n    can be secured, one will be made and sent out.\n\nThus it can be easily seen that we were indeed pioneers. In many\nplaces no school-house was to be found, and in some cases it was even\ndifficult to get the town council to provide a case in which to keep\nthe supplies.\n\nThe work of the teachers was, in short; to \"make the English language\nthe basis of instruction in the public schools.\" On our arrival at\nBacalod two schools were found in progress, for some soldiers had been\ndetailed for the work here previous to our coming. One of these was\nfor boys and the other, for girls. Thus the work here had been in a\nmeasure simplified, but complications that had arisen at Talisay, one\nof the largest and richest towns on the island, demanded a change of\nteachers and the writer was assigned to the place as superintendent.\n\nHere an attempt had been made to start a school but it had failed\nignominiously and a system of education was to be put into operation\nfrom the very start.\n\nThe Filipinos are not strong advocates of co-education, so separate\nschools were to be started for the boys and the girls. The one for the\nboys was gotten well in hand before the one for the girls was\nattempted at all.\n\nA few days after reaching the town and securing a home the\npresidente of the town had it publicly announced that the following\nMonday morning at eight o'clock a public school for boys would be\nopened in a building that had been rented for the purpose by the\nmunicipal council. About the middle of the afternoon of the same day a\nman beat a little drum throughout all the streets of the town to call\nthe people out and the town clerk announced both in Spanish and in the\nnative language that this public school would begin at the time and\nplace mentioned above; that instruction would be free to all who came;\nthat the government would furnish all supplies; and that instruction\nwould be given in the English language. A native principal and\nassistants were employed and everything was ready to begin.\n\nThe official report of the result is as follows:\n    Boys' public school of Talisay, Negros, P. I., began November\n    4, 1901. Forty-three boys present at eight o'clock. Forty-one\n    of them knew \"good morning\" and \"good afternoon\" but do not\n    know the distinction between them. Two of them speak simple\n    Spanish. At eight forty-five, eight more, who had been\n    attending an early morning private school, came in together.\n\n    The books they brought were so varied and so different from\n    one another that it seemed impossible to bring any reasonable\n    degree of order out of such a chaos, and so, after struggling\n    vainly for about a week with the problem, the superintendent\n    by one fell stroke removed everything in use and put in a\n    uniform system, and from that day on the English language has\n    been the basis of instruction in the public schools of\n    Talisay. The work was of necessity very slow at first, but by\n    the end of a year two schools were going nicely and a number\n    of the brightest boys and girls had made really excellent\n    progress.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER V. - A \"BAILE.\"\n\n\nNot long after the arrival of our party at Bacalod we received an\ninvitation to a \"baile\" given in our honor by the inhabitants of\nSilay, a town some ten or twelve miles up the northern coast and one\nnoted for its social life. The invitation was accepted with pleasure,\nand about the middle of the afternoon on the day appointed we were\nclad in the immaculate white of the tropics and steaming away up the\ncoast on board a launch sent for our conveyance. Twilight was still\nlingering on the path of day when we anchored just off shore at the\ntown. A row-boat containing the officials of the city came out to meet\nus and, in due season, we were ushered into a spacious drawing-room\nfilled almost to overflowing with the \u00e9lite of the town. The \u00e9lite of\ntowns in the Philippines speak Spanish, and, as only one or two of our\nparty could at that time boast of more than a formal acquaintance with\nthe Castilian tongue, the exchange of ideas that evening between us\nand the Filipinos was of necessity not very rapid.\n\nThe necessity of easy communication between us was rendered somewhat\nless indispensable by the announcement of supper as soon as we were\nrested from our trip. When we had taken our places at the table a\nyoung Filipino about twenty-five years of age arose and gave a lengthy\ntoast to the recent union of the Philippines with the United States.\n\nBut as we Americans were unable to scale the dizzy heights of his\nclimaxes or sink to the depths of his pathos, we forewent the\npleasures of his oratory and turned our attention to the savory odor\nof lamb, chicken, and roast pig that came slyly stealing up our\nnostrils to send us nerve dispatches about the gastronomic delights of\nour not far distant future.\n\nAt last the toast was ended and the world-wide soup ushered in a long\ntrain of things good to eat, served in a style better fitted to the\ndelights of the appetite than to the formalities of dinners, for, as\nsoon as the pleasant task of one dish was completed by any one, the\nnext was served him at once regardless of the progress made by the\nothers at the table.\n\nThe last course was dulce. The new-comers to the Philippines will\nnot be long in making the acquaintance of this dish, and at all\nmeetings, both public and private, where eatables are served, it\nperforms an important part. It is anything sweet, and it may vary all\nthe way from an india-rubber-like black mixture of cocoanut milk and\ndirty sugar to a really toothsome and respectable confection. No\nmatter of what materials a dish is composed, just so long as it is\nsweet, it is dulce.\n\nAfter paying our respects to this last course, we arose from the table\nand entered a great rectangular room from the center of whose ceiling\nhung a large glass chandelier, a mass of shimmering crystals. In the\nchairs around the room were the wealth, the youth, and the beauty of\nthe town.\n\nThe first and also the last number of every Filipino dance of any\nformality is the \"rigodon.\" The dancers are arranged in a square, or\nquadrangle according to the number participating, and are then led\nthrough a tangled maze of figures that so utterly bewilders the novice\nthat he sinks into his chair at the end of the dance wondering how it\nall came to pass.\n\nWe Americans breathed a sigh of relief when the \"rigodon\" ended, and\nmustered fresh courage for social conquests in the waltz that was now\nbreathing forth from the trembling strings. My companion in the first\ndance had been the young lady by whose side I had sat at dinner. But\nit now became necessary to search for another, so I prudently waited\nto see how partners were chosen, and made no mistake when a few\nmoments later I faced one of the most luscious looking se\u00f1oritas on\nthe opposite side of the room and offered her my arm. My eyes must\nhave told the story that my lips could not utter in Spanish, for she\nsmiled upon me sweetly, arose, and put her hand upon my shoulder. My\narm encircled her waist and I began to waltz. Unfortunately my\ncompanion did not follow, but began to hop up and down in a manner\nmost distressing. Supposing the attack to be only temporary, I paused\nand, much to my relief, she soon showed signs of recovery; and in the\ncourse of time she came to a standstill looking up into my face in an\ninquiring sort of way, apparently wondering why St. Vitus had not paid\nhis respects to me also. A second attempt to follow the music met with\nresults similar to the first, and during the third attempt, which\nseemed to be trembling on the verge of a failure, St. Vitus let go my\ncompanion and seized me with such vigor that she, who was small even\nfor a Filipino, was gathered up bodily and taken around the room at\nsuch a pace that her toes touched the floor only at far distant\nintervals.\n\nAt this point my devotion to the shrine of Terpsichore ceased from\nforce of circumstances and I seated myself in one of the most\ncomfortable chairs in sight that I might carry out a previously formed\nplan to study the Filipino somewhat critically as he appears in\nsociety.\n\nThe first thing that impressed me as the dancers passed up and down\nthe room was the flash of diamonds. Nearly every woman in the room had\non a brooch that flashed the colors of the rainbow at every turn.\n\nAlmost all of them wore one or more rings that showed up brilliantly\nunder the chandelier. Many of the men too, especially the young men,\nwore gems that appeared to be exquisite. A closer inspection showed\nthat some of the gems had flaws and others were of a poor color, but\nno one would have denied that, taken as a whole, it was a really\nbeautiful display.\n\nThe dress of the ladies was richly colored. Many of their skirts were\nof silk covered with hand embroidered flowers, and their filmy pina\nwaists and broad collar pieces were rich with needle-work. They all\nwore a kind of heelless velvet slipper, very common as a dress shoe in\nthe Philippines, or high-heeled patent leather shoes with neatly\nfitting black stockings.\n\nThe men were dressed in white coats and white pantaloons or black\ncoats and white pantaloons. White shirts and collars, together with\nall sorts and styles of cravats and low-cut patent leather shoes with\nhighly colored socks completed their dress.\n\nIt was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money;\nthat they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a\ntable loaded with good things was a fact to which all of us were\nenthusiastic witnesses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VI. - A SKETCH OF LIFE IN THE PHILIPPINES.\n\n\nHouse-keeping in the Philippines presents some interesting phases. Our\nclub of American officials decided to run a mess, so we employed a\ncook and a house boy, then each of us provided himself with a personal\nservant, making a total of six servants for four men--it takes about\nthis proportion of servants to live in any sort of comfort in the\nPhilippines--and launched ourselves boldly upon the sea of domestic\neconomy. But there were shoals ahead of us, for the question of\nregulating servants is one of no small importance in the Philippines,\nand one of its most disadvantageous features is the long chain of\ndependents that usually attends it.\n\nWe gave the cooks so much a day with which to buy supplies in the\nlocal market, for our own table, making him render a daily list of\nexpenditures, and a fixed amount besides to purchase rice and fish for\nhimself and the other servants. Of course, if they wished to vary\ntheir diet and get chicken and fresh pork, which could be had at far\ndistant intervals, it was wholly a matter of their option, but the\nallowance was made on the basis of so much rice and fish a day for\neach. This allowance was about fifteen cents a day in Spanish coin per\nservant.\n\nThus far all was well. We had agreed to give the cook eight dollars a\nmonth in Spanish money, thinking that good wages would procure good\nservice, but the visions of affluence that floated before him on such\nfloods of wealth were so alluring that they drew him from the kitchen\nto the cooler veranda. In less than a week he had employed an\nassistant at four dollars a month; in less than another week that\nassistant had employed him an assistant at two dollars a month; in\nless than another week that assistant to the assistant had employed\nhim an assistant at the princely salary of fifty cents a month; and\nfrom fear that the chain of dependents would end only by our having\nthe whole Filipino race attached to our culinary force, we broke up\nhouse-keeping and went boarding again, choosing that as the less of\nthe two evils.\n\nOur house furnishings were almost wholly Philippine. The table ware\nand the food on the table came from the ends of the earth. The knives\nand forks were made in Germany, the plates were manufactured in\nEngland, the glass ware and table cloth, in the United States. The\noatmeal and flour came from the United States also. The butter came\nfrom Australia, the rice from China, the salt from Russia, and the\nother eatables from sources about as various as their separate names.\n\nSwitzerland furnished the condensed milk and Illinois the canned\ncream. Nearly all of the canned fruit bore labels from Spain.\n\nThus it can easily be seen that life in the Philippines, if lived\naccording to American ideals, is dependent upon a highly developed and\nhighly complex commerce. However, the difficulties of transportation\nand the restriction of large stocks of merchandise to Manila and some\nhalf a dozen other towns, make so great a difference between country\nlife and city life that a short comparison of the two will not be out\nof place, and life in Manila may well be taken as being fairly typical\nof the latter.\n\nLife in Manila is pleasant, but expensive. It is pleasant from the\nfact that it is not only the capital but also metropolis of the\narchipelago. Thus the combination of wealth and high official position\nhas given to Manila a society of the highest and most refined type.\n\nThe process of beautifying and improving the city which is constantly\ngoing on bids fair to give us at no distant day a city of which we may\nwell be proud.\n\nBut let him who intends living well in Manila on a small income bid\nfarewell at once to so idylic a dream, for it costs much to live well\nthere. In the city of Manila one can get almost anything he wishes,\nbut it must be paid for at the price it commands. Especially in the\ncase of eatables, this price is by no means small, because to the\nfirst cost of articles must in most cases be added the expense of\ndistant shipment from American, European, or Australian ports, and not\ninfrequently the cost of long refrigeration must also be taken into\nconsideration. But, expensive though it is, it is very pleasant to\nlive there and those who have once enjoyed it often wish again to\nquaff the cup of its delights.\n\nIn strong contrast to this pleasant life is the life of the quiet\nlittle hamlet away in the distant islands. Indeed, the Filipino from\nthe distant town, who by some good fortune has been to Manila, or, by\na coup de main, has studied in one of the Manila colleges, is looked\nup to in a true hero-worshiping attitude by all who either know him or\nhear of his fame. Life in such a place is one long state of harmless\ninactivity. Not a wave of trouble from the great outer world ever\ndisturbs its peaceful repose. One lounges forever in an air of\nindolent ease and extreme aversion to anything approaching what might\nbe called a respectable effort.\n\nOne arises in the morning about the time the sun's first rays silver\nthe top leaves of the cocoanut trees and then stirs around until nine\nor ten o'clock, when it is found expedient to avoid a further exposure\nto the sun. From then until about five o'clock in the afternoon it is\nbest to take things as they come, even though one of those things be a\nFilipino dinner. But then you may have your vehiclo attached to a\nyoung bull with a ring in his nose and go for a drive. If it is the\ndry season you will probably enjoy the drive unless you object to the\nfrequent clouds of dust swept along by the evening wind. If it is in\nthe rainy season your pleasure will depend to a considerable extent\nupon how wet you get; but, whether the season be wet or dry, your\npleasure will be regulated largely by the state of harmony existing\nbetween the driver and the bull.\n\nIn these quiet secluded nooks successive generations of Filipinos are\nborn, reared, grow old and die in an even chain of events broken only\nby the occasional erection of a new grass house on the identical spot\nwhere its predecessors have stood for ages. The son lives in the house\nof his father, cultivates the same few square feet of soil planted in\nedible roots, climbs the same cocoanut trees, follows the same winding\npath down to the stream, pounds rice in the same mortar and with the\nsame stick that his ancestors have used from time unremembered, and,\nin case of illness, curls up on a grass mat in a corner of the room\nuntil he dies or by some good fortune recovers. Beyond this narrow\nhorizon he never looks. So narrow and contracted is the life that the\nlanguages of two towns a few miles apart are so different that one\nwould scarcely recognize them as belonging to the same race of people.\n\nSuch are the two extremes of life in our new far Eastern provinces:\nthe one is active, progressive, and cosmopolitan; the other, inactive,\ndecadent, and narrow; but, whether one enjoys the first or endures the\nsecond, there comes to him after leaving a longing to lounge again in\ntropic airs and listen to the lullaby of the winds among the palms.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VII. - THE FILIPINO AT HOME.\n\n\nAs one enters a Filipino sitting-room for the first time, there is one\nfeature in the arrangement of the furniture that impresses itself upon\nhim at once, and it may be stated without fear of serious\ncontradiction that this same peculiar feature in its arrangement will\ncontinue to face him, as he enters different homes, about as certainly\nas he crosses the threshold.\n\nThe arrangement referred to is that of one large mirror, one settee,\nand some ten or a dozen chairs that appear to have had a certain\norderly affection for one another. The mirror is hung upon one of the\nlarge interior parts of the house about four feet above the floor. The\nwooden houses in the Philippines are built by setting large posts\nupright into the ground, extending into the air from twenty to thirty\nfeet. Cross timbers are fastened to these upright posts about eight or\nten feet above the ground and then not sawed off even with the posts,\nbut allowed to extend beyond them each way. The framework of the house\nis built upon these extending cross timbers, a style of building by\nwhich these large upright posts are left standing out on the inside of\nthe room from one to three feet from the walls. It is on that one of\nthese posts most nearly opposite the door that the mirror always finds\nits place. Immediately beneath the mirror is the settee; and the\nchairs are arranged in two parallel lines facing one another and at\nright angles with the ends of the settee. However odd this arrangement\nmay appear to one when he first enters a Filipino drawing-room, there\nare two things to be said in its favor. In the first place, it places\nyou face to face with the person with whom you are conversing so that\nyou can watch him,--a matter of no small moment in the Philippines. In\nthe next place, it enables you to give one of the young ladies a\nsheep's-eye in the mirror while the others present are left where\nMoses was in our much abused conundrum.\n\nThe size of the residence and the quality of its furnishings depends\nupon the wealth of the owner. But there is so vast a difference\nbetween the mode of life of the highest class and the tao, or lowest\nclass, that it is well to speak of them separately, and the great\nmiddle class of Filipinos can easily be imagined to occupy the\nintervening ground.\n\nThe rich Filipino's house is usually of wood built upon a wall of\nstone or brick from ten to fifteen feet high. The floors are kept\nhighly polished in his hallway, dressing-room, and bed-rooms. There\nare, of course, no fire-places in any of the rooms, but on some\noccasions something is needed to dry the rain-soaked atmosphere, for\neven in the dry season it has been seen to rain for five successive\ndays and nights without the cessation of a moment.\n\nA long chain of dependents is attached to the household of the rich\nFilipino. The master has his special body servant to be present at all\ntimes to do his master's bidding, in short, to be the visible\nmechanism of his master's volition. So, too, the lady of the house has\nher servant woman to do the slightest bidding of her ladyship. Then\nthere is the cook who is almost invariably a man, a house boy or two,\nand the coachman. These functionaries, with their assistants and\nassistants to the assistants, together with a servant or two for the\nexclusive service of the children, complete the economic household.\n\nSuch a family has an abundance of rice and wheat bread, also of\nchicken and fish with occasional fresh beef. They have also a good\ndeal of dulce. They regularly serve wine and frequently serve beer\non their tables.\n\nIn strong contrast with this mode of life is that of the tao. His\ndiet consists almost wholly of rice and small uncleaned fish boiled\ntogether. As a rule knife, fork, plate, and spoon find no place in his\nhousehold. The rice and fish are boiled in a pot and then allowed to\ncool in the same vessel or poured out to cool in a large earthen or\nwooden bowl. Then Mr. Tao together with Mrs. Tao and all the young\nTaos squat on their heels around the mixture and satisfy that\nintangible thing called the appetite. They do not use chop sticks as\nthe Chinese do, but the rice and fish are caught in a hollow formed by\nthe first three fingers of the right hand. The thumb is then placed\nbehind the mass. It is raised up and poised before the mouth, with a\nskill coming from the evolution of ages, when a contraction of the\nmuscles of the thumb throws the mass into the mouth with a skill that\nis marvelous to any but a Filipino. To judge from the most reliable\ninformation, the poorest class do not have an abundance of food,\nalthough it would seem that such a condition of things would be\nwell-nigh impossible. However, in a census of one hundred school\nchildren there were found six boys and four girls who declared that\nthey had never had enough to eat, and the native teacher stated that\nthis was probably true.\n\nThe wide gulf between the tao and the rich man is filled by the\ngreat middle class of Filipinos.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VIII. - VISIT TO A LEPER COLONY.\n\n\nNot far from our town was a leper colony and the first Saturday that\ncould be spared was set aside for a trip to the place. It happened\nthat none of the other Americans were at leisure on this particular\nmorning, but, rather then delay the trip or miss it altogether, the\nwriter, armed with a revolver, started out alone.\n\nThe road had been described so accurately by one who was supposed to\nknow it that it was deemed well-nigh impossible to miss the way. The\nmain highway was followed to the point where the by-path supposed to\nlead to the settlement turned off through some bamboo thickets and a\nlow tropical wood. This path led straight away towards the sea-coast\nwhere the houses of the colony were said to stand in a cocoanut grove\nby the beach.\n\nUpon arriving at the settlement, a very inhospitable reception was\nreceived from a mangy cur that growled and showed a very uninviting\nset of sharp, white teeth behind his snarling lips. The growling of\nthe dog had attracted the attention of an old man who, with age-bent\nback, was pounding rice in a mortar about fifty yards away. He turned\nslowly around and, upon seeing an intruder into the primitive quiet of\nthe place, gave a sharp, far-reaching call. The sound had scarcely\nrung through the grove when from about a dozen of the little grass\nhouses dotted here and there fifteen or twenty men armed with bolos\ncame out and gathered around the old man. A sense of my danger flashed\nupon me. Three miles from town and alone in a tropical jungle, I could\nbe almost instantly overcome by this band of bolo-men, and the only\nreport that would ever reach my people would be that I had\n\"disappeared.\" Of course, attack was by no means certain, but the\npotentiality of the situation was thrilling. A drawn revolver and the\ngleaming of its shining barrel had the effect of stopping the men, who\nseemed to be hesitating as to a course of action, until a somewhat\ndignified retreat was made to an open space in the rear from where a\nless dignified and a more hasty retreat began which did not stop short\nof Bacalod.\n\nEnough had been seen, however, even in this short visit, to give\nconvincing proof that the settlement visited was no colony of lepers;\nso, that afternoon two servant boys being taken as guides and\ninterpreters, another attempt was made to reach the goal desired.\n\nThis attempt was successful, and, after about two hours of walking, a\nlittle cluster of grass huts snugly hidden by the sea-coast came into\nview. As we approached, one would have thought it a gala-day. Some few\nchildren, apparently from six to thirteen years of age, almost wholly\nnude, were romping and playing in the open space around which the huts\nstood, and no one would ever have thought that any cloud so horrible\nas leprosy could hover over a place apparently so happy.\n\nBy the side of the path as we passed was a man and his wife setting\nout potato plants. His hands were so puffed and his fingers so short\nthat he could scarcely use them, but he was working along as best he\ncould. His wife's feet were so swollen and twisted that she walked\nonly with the greatest difficulty. We passed them by and entered the\nopen space above referred to.\n\nThe children now saw us, and those of them who could darted away like\nfrightened rabbits, each to his own burrow. An old man who was sitting\nin the warm afternoon sun on the little bamboo platform before his hut\nwas aroused from his lethargic repose by the scampering away of the\nchildren. He arose, trembling upon his tottering limbs, all drawn and\ntwisted, and hobbled away into his hut.\n\nThe children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at\nthe doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of\nthe settlement. In a few moments we were surrounded by a circle of\nhuman beings at once so repulsive and so pitiable that its graphic\nvividness can never be accurately portrayed.\n\nThe old man referred to above, having put on a pair of snow-white\npantaloons, appeared now at the doorway of his hut, followed a few\nmoments later by his wife who had evidently clothed herself in the\nbest raiment she had. At a call from the old man, all the men, women,\nand children in the settlement came out of their huts and stood in a\nline before us. The old man was spokesman and in his native visayan\ntongue made a heart-rending appeal for aid which we were powerless to\ngive. Attention was called to a leper woman, apparently about\ntwenty-five years of age, whose face had been attacked by the disease\nand whose appearance was truly pathetic. Upon her hip was a child\nabout a year and a half old and, strange to say, the child showed as\nyet no signs whatever of the disease.\n\nWhat an indissoluble enigma is life! Here in a little cluster of grass\nhuts in a secluded nook of a secluded island of an all but secluded\narchipelago was gathered together a little community of wretched\nnatives, driven by their loathsomeness from association with others\neven of the same half-savage race. Yet here, men and women loved and\nwere married, by mutual trust if not by law, and children were born of\nthe union to live forever under the unspeakable horror that\novershadowed the unfortunate parents. Love, hatred, sorrow, and\njoy--every passion that enters into the complex structure of the human\nheart even here, in this scene of sadness and despair, was playing\napparently as freely as where misfortune and disease had never crossed\nthe portals of life.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER IX. - A \"HIKE.\"\n\n\nWe were lounging lazily in our hammocks at Jimamaylan one evening in\nApril. Supper was just ended, and the soldiers in the post were\ncollected in groups here and there spinning yarns to pass away the\ntime, when a Filipino clad only in a loin cloth came down the street\nat a steadily swinging run and stopped in front of the sentry. He\nbrought the announcement that a band of ladrones had just burned a\nsugar mill and were advancing to sack a barrio about fifteen miles\naway.\n\nThe invitation of the commanding officer to go on a \"hike\" was eagerly\naccepted, and, in ten minutes after the message was given, the troops\nwere on the march followed by two adventurous pedagogues.\n\nDarkness was just closing in as we left the town, but a resplendent\ntropic moon soon made the night almost as brilliant as the day. The\ntrail we followed led over rough and rocky country. Sometimes for a\ndistance of a mile or more we passed over barren wastes of volcanic\nslag poured out in anger by some peak whose convulsions have long\nsince ceased. Again we would descend into a tropical jungle from the\ndense foliage of which the ladrones could have leaped at any moment,\nhad they known of our coming, and annihilated our little band. We\nforded rapid streams with the water at our breasts, and halted only\nonce in that rapid march of fifteen miles.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the town we met a man who was standing\nguard against a surprise by the ladrones. Nothing could well have been\nmuch more grotesque and nothing could much better illustrate the\nabsolutely primitive condition of the Filipinos in the interior of the\nislands than the appearance of this guard. A pair of knee pants, a\nconical grass hat, and a hemp shirt formed his entire apparel. A long\nflat wooden shield, a bolo, and a long bamboo spear with a sharp,\nflat, iron point, completed his equipment for battle.\n\nHere stood the first and the twentieth centuries side by side. The\nFilipino who had advanced only a stage beyond the condition of\nprimitive man with his knife, spear, and wooden shield, stood side by\nside with the American soldier, a representative of modern life with\nhis magazine rifle, his canteen, his knapsack,--with every article of\nhis clothing made to give him the highest possible efficiency as the\nunit of a military organization.\n\nA few yards farther on we met another guard equipped similarly to the\nfirst. Upon reaching the town, news had just been received that a\ndetachment of troops from another post had intercepted the ladrones\nand fought a skirmish with them. The ladrones had escaped and we set\nout in pursuit of them on a chase wilder than a Quixotic dream. We\nwound our way into the mountains behind the town, inquiring at every\ngrass hut we passed whether the band of ladrones had passed that way,\nbut only once was even a trace of them found. Then it was learned that\nat a certain place they had separated into groups of three or four and\ngone glimmering through the dream of things that were. This place was\nin a secluded nook of the mountains where in years gone by some\nadventurous Spaniard had erected a primitive water mill to grind his\nsugar-cane. We had now marched about twenty miles and the feet of the\npedagogues were a mass of blisters. They had reached the point where\nthat form of military maneuvering called \"hiking\" ceased to possess\nany alluring charms. So a native was persuaded to come out of his lone\nmountain hut and hitch up his carabao and cart. He was then made to\nget on the carabao's back, while the aforesaid pedagogues lay down on\nthe sugar-cane pulp that had been put into the body of the cart, and\nthe driver was instructed to start for the post we had left hours\nbefore, and not to stop until he got there. Being uncertain but that\nsome of the ladrones would learn of our having left the body of troops\nand would try the metal of our steel, we at first agreed that neither\nof us should go to sleep, but it was later decided that probably the\ndriver had no greater desire to cross the Styx than his passengers had\nand that in case of danger he would awaken us, so both took a revolver\nin each hand, stretched out supinely and went to sleep.\n\nSuch a sleep! The rough jolting of the cart over an almost impassable\nroad was never enough to break the spell of slumber. When we awoke the\nblazing tropic sun was past the midday mark of morning, shining full\ninto our unprotected and well-nigh blistered faces.\n\nA pack of dogs were heralding our approach to a little village at the\nfoot of the mountains where ponies were procured to take us back to\nthe post.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he insists, \"have stood the test of ages; and the plant\nevery where retained its name and credit: and one of our good\nherbarists, who had seen a wonderful case of a swoln spleen, so big, and\nhard as to be felt with terror, brought back to a state of nature by it\"\n\n(p. 37). The greatest portion of Hill's concluding section combines\nadvertisement for the powder medicine he was himself manufacturing at a\nhandsome profit together with a protest against competing apothecaries:\n\"An intelligent person was directed to go to the medicinal herb shops in\nthe several markets, and buy some of this Spleen-wort; the name was\nwritten, and shewn to every one; every shop received his money, and\nalmost every one sold a different plant, under the name of this: but\nwhat is very striking, not one of them the right\" (p. 42).\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis did not cease to be printed after Hill's in\n1766, but continued to issue from the presses into the nineteenth\ncentury. A good example of this is the tome by John Reid, physician to\nthe Finsbury Dispensary in London, Essays on Insanity, Hypochondriasis\nand Other Nervous Affections (1816), which summarizes theories of the\nmalady. A bibliographical study of such works would probably reveal\na larger number of titles in the nineteenth century than in the previous\none, but by this time the nature and definition of hypochondria had\nchanged significantly.\n\nIf John Hill's volume is not an important contribution in the history of\nmedicine, it is a lucid and brief exposition of many of the best ideas\nthat had been thought and written on the hyp, with the exception of his\nuninhibited prescribing of herbal medicines as cure-alls. An\nunderstanding of this disease is essential for readers of neoclassical\nEnglish literature, especially when we reflect upon the fact that some\nof the best literature of the period was composed by writers whom it\nafflicted. It is perhaps not without significance that the greatest poet\nof the Augustan age, Alexander Pope, thought it necessary as he lay on\nhis deathbed in May 1744 to exclaim with his last breath, \"I never was\nhippish in my whole life.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. I. - The NATURE of the DISORDER.\n\n\nTo call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and cruel. It\nis a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by thickened\nand distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver, and other\nparts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick scarce knows\none more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\n\nThe blood is a mixture of many fluids, which, in a state of health, are\nso combined, that the whole passes freely through its appointed vessels;\nbut if by the loss of the thinner parts, the rest becomes too gross to\nbe thus carried through, it will stop where the circulation has least\npower; and having thus stopped it will accumulate; heaping by degrees\nobstruction on obstruction.\n\nHealth and chearfulness, and the quiet exercise of mind, depend upon a\nperfect circulation: is it a wonder then, when this becomes impeded the\nbody looses of its health, and the temper of its sprightliness? to be\notherwise would be the miracle; and he inhumanly insults the afflicted,\nwho calls all this a voluntary frowardness. Its slightest state brings\nwith it sickness, anguish and oppression; and innumerable ills follow\nits advancing steps, unless prevented by timely care; till life itself\ngrows burthensome.\n\nThe disease was common in antient Greece; and her physicians understood\nit, better than those perhaps of later times, in any other country; who\nthough happy in many advantages these fathers of the science could not\nhave, yet want the great assistance of frequent watching it in all its\nstages.\n\nThose venerable writers have delivered its nature, and its cure: in the\nfirst every thing now shews they were right; and what they have said as\nto the latter will be found equally true and certain. This, so far as\npresent experience has confirmed it, and no farther, will be here laid\nbefore the afflicted in a few plain words.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. II. - Persons Subject to it.\n\n\nFatigue of mind, and great exertion of its powers often give birth to\nthis disease; and always tend to encrease it. The finer spirits are\nwasted by the labour of the brain: the Philosopher rises from his study\nmore exhausted than the Peasant leaves his drudgery; without the benefit\nthat he has from exercise. Greatness of mind, and steady virtue;\ndetermined resolution, and manly firmness, when put in action, and\nintent upon their object, all also lead to it: perhaps whatever tends to\nthe ennobling of the soul has equal share in bringing on this weakness\nof the body.\n\nFrom this we may learn easily who are the men most subject to it; the\ngrave and studious, those of a sedate temper and enlarged understanding,\nthe learned and wise, the virtuous and the valiant: those whom it were\nthe interest of the world to wish were free from this and every other\nillness; and who perhaps, except for this alloy, would have too large a\nportion of human happiness.\n\nThough these are most, it is not these alone, who are subject to it.\n\nThere are countries where it is endemial, and in other places some have\nthe seeds of it in their constitution; and in some it takes rise from\naccidents. In these last it is the easiest of cure; and in the first\nmost difficult.\n\nBeside the Greeks already named, the Jews of old time were heavily\nafflicted with this disease; and in their descendants to this day it is\noften constitutional: the Spaniards have it almost to a man; and so have\nthe American Indians. Perhaps the character of these several nations may\nbe connected with it. The steady honour, and firm valour of the\nSpaniard, very like that of the ancient Doric nation, who followed the\nflute not the trumpet to the field; and met the enemy, not with shouts\nand fury, but with a determined virtue: it is the temper of the\nHypochondriac to be slow, but unmoveably resolved: the Jew has shewn\nthis mistakenly, but almost miraculously; and the poor Indian, untaught\nas he is, faces all peril with composure, and sings his death-song with\nan unalter'd countenance.\n\nAmong particular persons the most inquiring and contemplative are those\nwho suffer oftenest by this disease; and of all degrees of men I think\nthe clergy. I do not mean the hunting, shooting, drinking clergy, who\nbear the tables of the great; but the retir'd and conscientious; such as\nattend in midnight silence to their duty; and seek in their own cool\nbreasts, or wheresoever else they may be found, new admonitions for an\nage plunged in new vices. To this disease we owe the irreparable loss of\nDr. YOUNG; and the present danger of many other the best and most\nimproved amongst us. May what is here to be proposed assist in their\npreservation!\n\nThe Geometrician or the learned Philosopher of whatever denomination,\nwhose course of study fixes his eye for ever on one object, his mind\nintensely and continually employed upon one thought, should be warned\nalso that he is in danger; or if he find himself already afflicted, he\nshould be told that the same course of life, which brought it on, will,\nwithout due care, encrease it to the most dreaded violence.\n\nThe middle period of life is that in which there is the greatest danger\nof an attack from this disease; and the latter end of autumn, when the\nsummer heats have a little time been over, is the season when in our\nclimate its first assaults are most to be expected. The same time of the\nyear always increases the disorder in those who have been before\nafflicted with it; and it is a truth must be confessed, that from its\nfirst attack the patient grows continually, though slowly, worse; unless\na careful regimen prevent it.\n\nThe constitutions most liable to this obstruction are the lean, and dark\ncomplexioned; the grave and sedentary. Let such watch the first\nsymptoms; and obviate, (as they may with ease) that which it will be\nmuch more difficult to remove.\n\nIt is happy a disease, wherein the patient must do a great deal for\nhimself, falls, for the most part, upon those who have the powers of\nreason strongest. Let them only be aware of this, that the distemper\nnaturally disposes them to inactivity; and reason will have no use\nunless accompanied with resolution to enforce it.\n\nThough the physician can do something toward the cure, much more depends\nupon the patient; and here his constancy of mind will be employed most\nhappily. No one is better qualified to judge on a fair hearing what\ncourse is the most fit; and having made that choice, he must with\npatience wait its good effects. Diseases that come on slowly must have\ntime for curing; an attention to the first appearances of the disorder\nwill be always happiest; because when least established it is easiest\noverthrown: but when that happy period has been neglected, he must wait\nthe effects of such a course as will dilute and melt the obstructing\nmatter gradually; for till that be done it is not only vain, but\nsometimes dangerous, to attempt its expulsion from the body.\n\nThe blood easily separates itself into the grosser and the thinner\nparts: we see this in bleeding; and from the toughness of the red cake\nmay guess how very difficult it will be to dissolve a substance of like\nfirmness in the vessels of the body. That it can thus become thickened\nwithin the body, a Pleurisy shews us too evidently: in that case it is\nbrought on suddenly, and with inflammation; in this other, slowly and\nwithout; and here, even before it forms the obstruction, can bring on\nmany mischiefs. Various causes can produce the same effect, but that in\nall cases operates most durably, which operates most slowly. The watery\npart of the blood is its mild part; in the remaining gross matter of it,\nare acrid salts and burning oils, and these, when destitute of that\nhappy dilution nature gives them in a healthy body, are capable of doing\ngreat mischief to the tender vessels in which they are kept stagnant.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. III. - The SYMPTOMS of the DISORDER.\n\n\nThe first and lightest of the signs that shew this illness are a lowness\nof spirits, and inaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love\nof solitude and a habit of thinking, even on trifling subjects, with too\nmuch steadiness. A very little help may combat these: but if that\nindolence which is indeed a part of the disorder, will neglect them;\nworse must be expected soon to follow.\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness, weight, and oppression in the body,\na want of appetite, or, what is worse, an appetite without digestion;\nfor these are the conditions of different states of the disease, a\nfullness and a difficulty of breathing after meals, a straitness of the\nbreast, pains and flatulencies in the bowels, and an unaptness to\ndischarge their contents.\n\nThe pulse becomes low, weak, and unequal; and there are frequent\npalpitations of the heart, a little dark-coloured urine is voided at\nsome times; and a flood of colourless and insipid at others; relieving\nfor a moment, but increasing the distemper: there is in some cases also\na continual teazing cough, with a choaking stoppage in the throat at\ntimes; then heartburn, sickness, hardness of the belly, and a costive\nhabit, or a tormenting and vain irritation.\n\nThe lips turn pale, the eyes loose their brightness and by degrees the\nwhite grows as it were greenish, the gums want their due firmness, with\ntheir proper colour; and an unpleasing foulness grows upon the teeth:\nthe inside of the mouth is pale and furred, and the throat dry and\nhusky: the colour of the skin is pale (though there are periods when the\nface is florid) and as the obstruction gathers ground, and more affects\nthe liver, the whole body becomes yellow, tawny, greenish, and at length\nof that deep and dusky hue, to which men of swift imagination have given\nthe name of blackness.\n\nThese symptoms do not all appear in any one period of the disease, or in\none case, but at one time or other all of them, as well as those which\nfollow: the flesh becomes cold to the touch, though the patient does not\nhimself perceive it; the limbs grow numbed and torpid, the breathing\ndull and slow, and the voice hollow; and usually the appetite in this\nperiod declines, and comes almost to nothing: night sweats come on,\nblack swellings appear on the veins, the flesh wastes and the breast\nbecomes flat and hollow: the mouth is full of a thin spittle, the head\nis dizzy and confus'd, and sometimes there is an unconquerable numbness\nin the organs of speech.\n\nI have known the temporary silence that follows upon this last symptom\nbecome a jest to the common herd; and the unhappy patient, instead of\ncompassion and assistance, receive the reproof of sullenness, from those\nwho should have known and acted better.\n\nAbout twenty years ago I met on a visit at Catthorpe in Leicestershire a\nyoung gentleman of distinguished learning and abilities, who at certain\ntimes was speechless. The vulgar thought it a pretence: and a jocose\nlady, where he was at tea with company, putting him as she said to a\ntrial, poured out a dish very strong and without sugar. He drank it and\nreturned the cup with a bow of great reserve, and his eye bent on the\nground: she then filled the cup with sugar, and pouring weak tea on it,\nsent it him: he drank that too, looked at her steadily, and blushed for\nher. The lady declared the man was dumb; the rest thought him perverse,\nand obstinate; but a constant and steady perseverance in an easy method\ncured him.\n\nAll these are miseries which the disease, while it retains its natural\nform, can bring upon the patient; and thus he will in time be worn out,\nand led miserably, though slowly, to the grave. Let him not indulge his\ninactivity so far as to give way to this, because it is represented as\nfar off; the disease may suddenly and frightfully change its nature; and\nswifter evils follow.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. IV. - The DANGER.\n\n\nWe have done with the obstruction considered in itself; but this, though\noften unsurmountable by art, at least by the methods now in use, will be\nsometimes broken through at once by nature, or by accidents; and bring\non fatal evils. These are strictly different diseases, and are no\notherway concerned here, than as the consequences of that of which we\nare treating.\n\nThe thick and glutinous blood which has so long stagnated in the spleen,\nwill have in that time altered its nature, and acquired a very great\ndegree of acrimony: while it lies dormant, this does no more mischiefs,\nthan those named already; but when violent exercise, a fit of outrageous\nanger, or any thing else that suddenly shocks and disturbs the frame,\nputs it in motion, it melts at once into a kind of liquid putrefaction.\n\nBeing now thin, it mixes itself readily with the blood again, and brings\non putrid fevers; destroys the substance of the spleen itself, or being\nthrown upon some other of the viscera, corrodes them, and leads on this\nway a swift and miserable death. If it fall upon the liver, its tender\npulpy substance is soon destroyed, jaundices beyond the help of art\nfirst follow, then dropsies and all their train of misery; if on lungs,\nconsumptions; if on the brain, convulsions, epilepsy, palsy, apoplexy;\nif on the surface, leprosy.\n\nThe intention of cure is to melt this coagulation softly, not to break\nit violently; and then to give it a very gentle passage through the\nbowels. There is no safe way for it to take but that; and even that when\nurged too far may bring on fatal dysenteries.\n\nLet none wonder at the sudden devastation which sometimes arises from\nthis long stagnant matter, when liquified too hastily: how long, how\nmany years the impacted matter will continue quiet in a schirrous tumour\nof the breast; but being once put in motion, whether from accident, or\nin the course of nature, what can describe; or what can stop its\nhavock!\n\nInstances of the other are too frequent. A nobleman the other day died\nparalytick: dissection shewed a spleen consumed by an abscess, formed\nfrom the dissolved matter of such an obstruction: and 'tis scarce longer\nsince, a learned gentleman, who had been several years lost to his\nfriends, by the extreams of a Hypochondriacal disorder, seem'd gradually\nwithout assistance to recover: but the lungs suffered while the spleen\nwas freed; and he died very soon of what is called a galloping\nconsumption.\n\nWhen the obstruction is great and of long continuance, if it be thus\nhastily moved, the consequence is, equally, a sudden and a miserable\ndeath, whether, like the matter of a cancer, it remains in its place; or\nlike that of a bad small pox, be thrown upon some other vital part.\n\nLet not the patient be too much alarmed; this is laid down to caution,\nnot to terrify him: it is fit he should know his danger, and attend to\nit; for the prevention is easy; and the cure, even of the most advanced\nstages, when undertaken by gentle means, is not at all impracticable: to\nassist the physician, let him look into himself, and recollect the\nsource of his complaint. This he may judge of from the following\nnotices.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. V. - The Causes of the HYPOCHONDRIASIS.\n\n\nThe obstruction which forms this disease, may take its origin from\ndifferent accidents: a fever ill cured has often caused it; or the\npiles, which had been used to discharge largely, ceasing; a marshy soil,\npoisoned with stagnant water, has given it to some persons; and altho'\nindolence and inactivity are oftenest at the root, yet it has arisen\nfrom too great exercise.\n\nReal grief has often brought it on; and even love, for sometimes that is\nreal. Study and fixed attention of the mind have been accused before;\nand add to these the stooping posture of the body, which most men use,\nthough none should use it, in writing and in reading. This has\ncontributed too much to it; but of all other things night studies are\nthe most destructive. The steady stillness, and dusky habit of all\nnature in those hours, enforce, encourage, and support that settled\ngloom, which rises from fixt thought; and sinks the body to the grave;\neven while it carries up the mind to heaven. He who would have his lamp\n        At midnight hour\n  Be seen in some high lonely tower,\nwill waste the flame of this unheeded life: and while he labours to\nunsphere the spirit of Plato will let loose his own.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VI. - The Cure of the HYPOCHONDRIASIS.\n\n\nLet him who would escape the mischiefs of an obstructed spleen, avoid\nthe things here named: and let him who suffers from the malady,\nendeavour to remember to which of them it has been owing; for half the\nhope depends upon that knowledge.\n\nNature has sometimes made a cure herself, and we should watch her ways;\nfor art never is so right as when it imitates her: sometimes the\npatient's own resolution has set him free. This is always in his power,\nand at all times will do wonders.\n\nThe bleeding of the piles, from nature's single efforts, has at once\ncured a miserable man; where their cessation was the cause of the\ndisorder. A leprosy has appeared upon the skin, and all the symptoms of\nthe former sickness vanished. This among the Jews happened often: both\ndiseases we know were common among them: and I have here seen something\nvery like it: Water-Dock has thrown out scorbutic eruptions, and all the\nformer symptoms of an Hypochondriacal disorder have disappeared:\nreturning indeed when these were unadvisedly struck in; but keeping off\nentirely when they were better treated. A natural purging unsuppressed\nhas sometimes done the same good office: but this is hazardous.\n\nIt is easy to be directed from such instances; only let us take the\nwhole along with us. Bleeding would have answered nature's purpose, if\nshe could not have opened of herself the h\u00e6morrhoidal vessels; but he\nwho should give medicines for that purpose, might destroy his patient by\ntoo great disturbance. If a natural looseness may perform the cure, so\nmay an artificial; when the original source of the disorder points that\nway. But these are helps that take place only in particular cases.\n\nThe general and universal method of cure must be by some mild and gently\nresolving medicine, under the influence of which the obstructing matter\nmay be voided that, or some other way with safety. The best season to\nundertake this is the autumn, but even here there must be caution.\n\nIn the first place, no strong evacuating remedy must be given; for that,\nby carrying off the thinner parts of the juices, will tend to thicken\nthe remainder; and certainly encrease the distemper. No acrid medicine\nmust be directed, for that may act too hastily, dissolve the impacted\nmatter at once, and let it loose, to the destruction of the sufferer; no\nantimonial, no mercurial, no martial preparation must be taken; in\nshort, no chymistry: nature is the shop that heaven has set before us,\nand we must seek our medicine there. The venerable ancients, who knew\nnot this new art, will lead us in the search; and (faithful relators as\nthey are of truth) will tell us whence we may deduce our hope; and what\nwe are to fear.\n\nBut prior to the course of any medicine, and as an essential to any good\nhope from it, the patient must prescribe himself a proper course of\nlife, and a well chosen diet: let us assist him in his choice; and speak\nof this first, as it comes first in order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VI. - Rules of Life for Hypochondriac Persons.\n\n\nAir and exercise, as they are the best preservers of health, and\ngreatest assistants in the cure of all long continued diseases, will\nhave their full effect in this; but there requires some caution in the\nchoice, and management of them. It is common to think the air of high\ngrounds best; but experience near home shews otherwise: the\nHypochondriac patient is always worse at Highgate even than in London.\n\nThe air he breathes should be temperate; not exposed to the utmost\nviolences of heat and cold, and the swift changes from one to the\nother; which are most felt on those high grounds. The side of a hill is\nthe best place for him: and though wet grounds are hurtful; yet let\nthere be the shade of trees, to tempt him often to a walk; and soften by\ntheir exhalation the over dryness of the air.\n\nThe exercise he takes should be frequent; but not violent. Motion\npreserves the firmness of the parts, and elasticity of the vessels; it\nprevents that aggregation of thick humours which he is most to fear. A\nsedentary life always produces weakness, and that mischief always\nfollows: weak eyes are gummy, weak lungs are clogged with phlegm, and\nweak bowels waste themselves in vapid diarrhoeas.\n\nLet him invite himself abroad, and let his friends invite him by every\ninnocent inducement. For me, I should advise above all other things the\nstudy of nature. Let him begin with plants: he will here find a\ncontinual pleasure, and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful\nthings; even of the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to\nwalk; and every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket,\nwill afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually\nin the air, and continually to change the nature and quality of the air,\nby visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the lawn, the\nheath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be abroad; and the\nunceasing variety of the subjects of his observation, will prevent his\nwalking hastily: he will pursue his studies in the air; and that\ncontemplative turn of mind, which in his closet threatened his\ndestruction, will thus become the great means of his recovery.\n\nIf the mind tire upon this, from the repeated use, another of nature's\nkingdoms opens itself at once upon him; the plant he is weary of\nobserving, feeds some insect he may examine; nor is there a stone that\nlies before his foot, but may afford instruction and amusement.\n\nEven what the vulgar call the most abject things will shew a wonderful\nutility; and lead the mind, in pious contemplation higher than the\nstars. The poorest moss that is trampled under foot, has its important\nuses: is it at the bottom of a wood we find it? why there it shelters\nthe fallen seeds; hides them from birds, and covers them from frost;\nand thus becomes the foster father of another forest! creeps it along\nthe surface of a rock? even there its good is infinite! its small roots\nrun into the stone, and the rains make their way after them; the moss\nhaving lived its time dies; it rots and with the mouldered fragments of\nthe stone forms earth; wherein, after a few successions, useful plants\nmay grow, and feed more useful cattle!\n\nIs there a weed more humble in its aspect, more trampled on, or more\ndespised than knot grass! no art can get the better of its growth, no\nlabour can destroy it; 'twere pity if they could, for the thing lives\nwhere nothing would of use to us; and its large and most wonderfully\nabundant seeds, feed in hard winters, half the birds of Heaven.\n\nWhat the weak moss performs upon the rock the loathed toadstool brings\nabout in timber: is an oak dead where man's eye will not find it? this\nfungus roots itself upon the bark, and rots the wood beneath it; hither\nthe beetle creeps for shelter, and for sustenance; him the woodpecker\nfollows as his prey; and while he tears the tree in search of him, he\nscatters it about the ground; which it manures.\n\nNor is it the beetle alone that thus insinuates itself into the\nsubstance of the vegetable tribe: the tender aphide, whom a touch\ndestroys, burrows between the two skins of a leaf, for shelter from his\nwinged enemies; tracing, with more than Dedal\u00e6an art, his various\nmeanders; and veining the green surface with these white lines more\nbeautifully than the best \u00c6gyptian marble.\n\n'Twere endless to proceed; nor is it needful: one object will not fail\nto lead on to another, and every where the goodness of his God will\nshine before him even in what are thought the vilest things; his\ngreatness in the lead of them.\n\nLet him pursue these thoughts, and seek abroad the objects and the\ninstigations to them: but let him in these and all other excursions\navoid equally the dews of early morning, and of evening.\n\nThe more than usual exercise of this prescription will dispose him to\nmore than customary sleep, let him indulge it freely; so far from\nhurting, it will help his cure.\n\nLet him avoid all excesses: drink need scarce be named, for we are\nwriting to men of better and of nobler minds, than can be tempted to\nthat humiliating vice. Those who in this disorder have too great an\nappetite, must not indulge it; much eaten was never well digested: but\nof all excesses the most fatal in this case is that of venery. It is the\nexcess we speak of.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VII. - The proper DIET.\n\n\nIn the first place acids must be avoided carefully; and all things that\nare in a state of fermentation, for they will breed acidity. Provisions\nhardened by salting never should be tasted; much less those cured by\nsmoaking, and by salting. Bacon is indigestible in an Hypochondriac\nstomach; and hams, impregnated as is now the custom, with acid fumes\nfrom the wood fires over which they are hung, have that additional\nmischief.\n\nMilk ought to be a great article in the diet: and even in this there\nshould be choice. The milk of grass-fed cows has its true quality: no\nother. There are a multitude of ways in which this may be made a part\nboth of our foods and drinks, and they should all be used.\n\nThe great and general caution is that the diet be at all times of a kind\nloosening and gently stimulating; light but not acrid. Veal, lamb,\nfowls, lobsters, crabs, craw-fish, fresh water fish and mutton broth,\nwith plenty of boiled vegetables, are always right; and give enough\nvariety.\n\nRaw vegetables are all bad: sour wines, old cheese, and bottled beer are\nthings never to be once tasted. Indeed much wine is wrong, be it of what\nkind soever. It is the first of cordials; and as such I would have it\ntaken in this disease when it is wanted: plainly as a medicine, rather\nthan a part of diet. Malt liquor carefully chosen is certainly the best\ndrink. This must be neither new, nor tending to sourness; perfectly\nclear, and of a moderate strength: it is the native liquor of our\ncountry, and the most healthful.\n\nToo much tea weakens; and even sugar is in this disorder hurtful: but\nhoney may supply its place in most things; and this is not only harmless\nbut medicinal; a very powerful dissolvent of impacted humours, and a\ngreat deobstruent.\n\nWhat wine is drank should be of some of the sweet kinds. Old Hock has\nbeen found on enquiry to yield more than ten times the acid of the sweet\nwines; and in red Port, at least in what we are content to call so,\nthere is an astringent quality, that is most mischievous in these cases:\nit is said there is often alum in it: how pregnant with mischief that\nmust be to persons whose bowels require to be kept open, is most\nevident. Summer fruits perfectly ripe are not only harmless but\nmedicinal; but if eaten unripe they will be very prejudicial. A light\nsupper, which will leave an appetite for a milk breakfast, is always\nright; this will not let the stomach be ravenous for dinner, as it is\napt to be in those who make that their only meal.\n\nOne caution more must be given, and it may seem a strange one: it is\nthat the patient attend regularly to his hours of eating. We have to do\nwith men for the most part whose soul is the great object of their\nregard; but let them not forget they have a body.\n\nThe late Dr. STUKELY has told me, that one day by appointment visiting\nSir ISAAC NEWTON, the servant told him, he was in his study. No one was\npermitted to disturb him there; but as it was near dinner time, the\nvisitor sat down to wait for him. After a time dinner was brought in; a\nboil'd chicken under a cover. An hour pass'd, and Sir ISAAC did not\nappear. The doctor eat the fowl, and covering up the empty dish, bad\nthem dress their master another. Before that was ready, the great man\ncame down; he apologiz'd for his delay, and added, \"give me but leave to\ntake my short dinner, and I shall be at your service; I am fatigued and\nfaint.\" Saying this, he lifted up the cover; and without any emotion,\nturned about to STUKELY with a smile; \"See says he, what we studious\npeople are, I forgot I had din'd.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VIII. - The MEDICINE.\n\n\n'Tis the ill fate of this disease, more than of all others to be\nmisunderstood at first, and thence neglected; till the physician shakes\nhis head at a few first questions. None steals so fatally upon the\nsufferer: its advances are by very slow degrees; but every day it grows\nmore difficult of cure.\n\nThat this obstruction in the spleen is the true malady, the cases\nrelated by the antients, present observation, and the unerring\ntestimonies of dissections leave no room to doubt. Being understood, the\npath is open where to seek a remedy: and our best guides in this, as in\nthe former instance, will be those venerable Greeks; who saw a thousand\nof these cases, where we see one; and with less than half our theory,\ncured twice as many patients.\n\nOne established doctrine holds place in all these writers; that whatever\nby a hasty fermentation dissolves the impacted matter of the\nobstruction, and sends it in that state into the blood, does incredible\nmischief: but that whatever medicine softens it by slow degrees, and, as\nit melts, delivers it to the bowels without disturbance; will cure with\nequal certainty and safety.\n\nFor this good purpose, they knew and tried a multitude of herbs; but in\nthe end they fixed on one: and on their repeated trials of this, they\nbanished all the rest. This stood alone for the cure of the disease; and\nfrom its virtue received the name of SPLEEN-WORT. O wise and happy\nGreeks! authors of knowledge and perpetuators of it! With them the very\nname they gave a plant declared its virtues: with us, a writer calls a\nplant from some friend; that the good gardener who receives the honour,\nmay call another by his name who gave it. We now add the term smooth\nto this herb, to distinguish it from another, called by the same general\nterm, though not much resembling it.\n\nThe virtues of this smooth Spleen-wort have flood the test of ages; and\nthe plant every where retained its name and credit: and one of our good\nherbalists, who had seen a wonderful case of a swoln spleen, so big, and\nhard as to be felt with terror, brought back to a state of nature by it;\nand all the miserable symptoms vanish; thought Spleen-wort not enough\nexpressive of its excellence; but stamp'd on it the name of MILT-WASTE.\n\nIn the Greek Islands now, the use of it is known to every one; and even\nthe lazy monks who take it, are no longer splenetic. In the west of\nEngland, the rocks are stripped of it with diligence; and every old woman\ntells you how charming that leaf is for bookish men: in Russia they use\na plant of this kind in their malt liquor: it came into fashion there\nfor the cure of this disease; which from its constant use is scarce\nknown any longer; and they suppose 'tis added to their liquor for a\nflavour.\n\nThe ancients held it in a kind of veneration; and used what has been\ncalled a superstition in the gathering it. It was to be taken up with a\nsharp knife, without violence, and laid upon the clean linen: no time\nbut the still darkness of the night was proper, and even the moon was\nnot to shine upon it. I know they have been ridiculed for this; for\nnothing is so vain as learned ignorance: but let me be permitted once to\nvindicate them.\n\nThe plant has leaves that can close in their sides; and their under part\nis covered thick with a yellow powder, consisting of the seeds, and seed\nvessels: in these they knew the virtue most resided: this was the golden\ndust they held so valuable; and this they knew they could not be too\ncautious to preserve. They were not ignorant of the sleep of plants; a\nmatter lately spoken of by some, as if a new discovery; and being\nsensible that light, a dry air, an expanded leaf, and a tempestuous\nseason, were the means of losing this fine dust; and knowing also that\ndarkness alone brought on that closing of the leaf which thence has\nbeen called sleep; and which helped to defend and to secure it, they\ntherefore took such time, and used such means as could best preserve the\nplant entire; and even save what might be scattered from it.--And now\nwhere is their superstition?\n\nFrom this plant thus collected they prepared a medicine, which in a\ncourse of forty days scarce ever failed to make a perfect cure.\n\nWe have the plant wild with us; and till the fashion of rough chemical\npreparations took off our attention from these gentler remedies, it was\nin frequent use and great repute. I trust it will be so again: and many\nthank me for restoring it to notice.\n\nSpleen-wort gives out its virtues freely in a tincture; and a small dose\nof this, mixing readily with the blood and juices, gradually dissolves\nthe obstruction; and by a little at a time delivers its contents to be\nthrown off without pain, from the bowels. Let this be done while the\nviscera are yet sound and the cure is perfect. More than the forty days\nof the Greek method is scarce ever required; much oftener two thirds of\nthat time suffice; and every day, from the first dose of it, the patient\nfeels the happy change that is growing in his constitution. His food no\nmore turns putrid on his stomach, but yields its healthful nourishment.\n\nThe swelling after meals therefore vanishes; and with that goes the\nlowness, and anxiety, the difficult breath, and the distracting cholick:\nhe can bear the approach of rainy weather without pain; he finds himself\nmore apt for motion, and ready to take that exercise which is to be\nassistant in his cure; life seems no longer burthensome. His bowels get\ninto the natural condition of health, and perform their office once at\nleast a day; better if a little more: the dull and dead colour of his\nskin goes off, his lips grow red again, and every sign of health\nreturns.\n\nLet him who takes the medicine, say whether any thing here be\nexaggerated. Let him, if he pleases to give himself the trouble, talk\nover with me, or write to me, this gradual decrease of his complaints,\nas he proceeds in his cure. My uncertain state of health does not\npermit me to practise physic in the usual way, but I am very desirous to\ndo what good I can, and shall never refuse my advice, such as it may be,\nto any person rich or poor, in whatever manner he may apply for it. I\nshall refer him to no apothecary, whose bills require he should be\ndrenched with potions; but tell him, in this as in all other cases,\nwhere to find some simple herb; which he may if he please prepare\nhimself; or if he had rather spare that trouble, may have it so prepared\nfrom me.\n\nWith regard to Spleen-wort, no method of using it is more effectual than\nsimply taking it in powder; the only advantage of a tincture, is that a\nproper dose may be given, and yet the stomach not be loaded with so\nlarge a quantity: it is an easier and pleasanter method, and nothing\nmore.\n\nIf any person choose to take it in the other way, I should still wish\nhim once at least to apply to me; that he may be assured what he is\nabout to take is the right plant. Abuses in medicines are at this time\nvery great, and in no instance worse than what relates to herbs. The\nbest of our physicians have complained upon this head with warmth, but\nwithout redress: they know the virtues and the value of many of our\nnative plants, but dread to prescribe them; lest some wrong thing should\nbe administered in their place; perhaps inefficacious, perhaps\nmischievous, nay it may be fatal. The few simple things I direct are\nalways before me; and it will at all times be a pleasure to me, in this\nand any other instance, to see whether what any person is about to take\nbe right. I have great obligations to the public, and this is the best\nreturn that I know how to make.\n\nTo see the need of such a caution, hear a transaction but of yesterday!\n\nAn intelligent person was directed to go to the medicinal herb shops in\nthe several markets, and buy some of this Spleen-wort; the name was\nwritten, and shewn to every one; every shop received his money, and\nalmost every one sold a different plant, under the name of this: but\nwhat is very striking, not one of them the right. Such is the chance of\nhealth in those hands through which the best means of it usually pass;\neven in the most regular course of application.\n\nI would not be understood to limit the little services I may this way be\nable to render the afflicted, to this single instance; much less to\npropose to myself any advantages from it. Whoever pleases will be\nwelcome to me, upon any such occasion; and whatever be the herb on which\nhe places a dependance, he shall be shewn it growing. I once recommended\na garden to be established for this use, at the public expence: one\ngreat person has put it in my power to answer all its purposes.\n\n                        F  I  N  I  S.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris, he was\n\"nominated\" to the Academy. He had but to present an Historical\nPainting in order to take his seat as an Academician.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VENUS AND MARRIAGE\n\n\nBack in his beloved Paris again; thrilled by the atmosphere and gaiety\nof its merry life; in the full vigour of manhood on the eve of his\nthirties; amongst congenial friends; done with the drudgery of winning\nto Academic honour, Boucher saw that the public were not falling over\neach other to purchase religious or historic pictures; he straightway\nturned his back upon these things, and on the edge of his thirtieth\nyear he gave to the world his \"Marriage of the Children of God with\nthe Children of Men,\" in which Venus is the avowed mistress of his\nadoration. It caused a fine stir, and greatly increased his repute.\n\nIn this picture he ends his Italian period and strikes his own\npersonal note. Both this and the \"Venus asking arms for Aeneas from\nVulcan,\" together with the \"Birth of Adonis\" and the \"Death of\nAdonis,\" of about the same period, still show Boucher strongly under\nthe influence of his master, Lemoyne. Indeed, the \"Birth\" and \"Death\nof Adonis,\" their record lost during the scuffle and confusion of the\nRevolution, for long hung side by side as pictures by Lemoyne, until,\nbeing cleaned about 1860, Boucher's initials were discovered upon\nthem, and, contemporary engravings being hunted up, still further\nproved their origin. But in the Venus that now figures in all his\nworks there is that flesh-painting of the nude, and that rosy touch\nupon the flesh of the female figure, that are a far more certain\nsignature of Boucher's handiwork than any written name.\n\nUnfortunately the Salons were closed during Boucher's earlier years\nuntil he was thirty-four, and the record of his work during these\nyears is difficult to follow; but with his service to Venus his\npersonal career begins, and the stream of his Venus-pieces steadily\nflows from his hands.\n\nHe came to her service rid of all prentice essays in craftsmanship, a\nfinished and consummate artist. He found in his subject a goddess to\nwhom he could devote his great and splendid gifts. He painted her\ndainty body with a radiant delight and a rare colour-sense such as\nFrance had never before seen or uttered. He remains to this day the\nfirst painter of the subtle, delicate, and elusive thing that is\nfemininity; he caught her allure, her charm, as he was to catch the\nfragrance and charm of children and flowers; and he set the statement\nof these things upon canvas as they have never been uttered.\n\nThe whole of his life long, Boucher gave himself up with equal and\npassionate devotion to work and to pleasure--working at his easel\noften twelve hours of his day without losing, to the end when the\nbrush fell from his dead fingers, his blitheness of heart or his\ngenerosity of act, and without weakening the pleasure-loving desires\nof his gadding spirit. Out of his splendid toil he made the means to\nindulge his tastes for pleasure; and the gratifying of his tastes in\nturn renewed and created the ideas that made the subjects of his\nartistry. He brought to all he did a joy in the doing that made of his\nvast labour one long pleasure--of his pleasures a riot of industry. He\nplayed as he toiled, scarce knowing which was play and which toil.\n\nThe gossip of his love-affairs makes no romantic story--they were but\ncommonplace ecstasies with unknown frail women. But hard as he worked\nand lived and played, he found time to get himself married in his\nthirtieth year to pretty seventeen-year-old Marie Jeanne Buseau, a\nlittle Parisian--and for love of her, so far as he understood the\nbusiness; for she brought him no dowry.\n\nThe young couple settled down for the next ten years in the Rue\nSaint-Thomas-du-Louvre. Here Boucher lived through his thirties.\n\nMadame was a pretty creature, if we had but Latour's pastel portrait\nalone to prove it. But the pretty features were the crown to as pretty\na body, for she sat often to her lord; and it is clear from his\ncorrespondence with a friend, Bachaumont, that she is the Psyche of\nhis illustrated fable--and Psyche runs much to the Altogether.\n\nMarriage, however, was not likely to imprison Boucher's gadding eyes;\nand it did not. Madame Boucher seems to have had as frail a heart, and\navoided strife by amusing herself, amongst others, with the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who, to gain access to the lady,\ncommissioned Boucher to do the Watteau-like illustrations to\nAcajou--a dull affair. Boucher's pretty wife, herself no mean\nartist, worked in his studio, and painted several smaller canvases\nafter his pictures, gaining some fame as a miniaturist and engraver.\n\nNor did Marriage turn Boucher from his art. Two years were gone by\nsince his nomination to the Academy; he had now to paint the formal\nHistorical Picture and present it in order to take his seat as\nAcademician; and it was in this his thirtieth year that he painted and\nwon his academic rank with the \"Renauld et Armide\" now at the Louvre.\n\nHere he sufficiently subordinated his own style to the academic to\nensure success; and the work was hailed by Academicians and critics,\nincluding Diderot, with enthusiasm. But even here we have his cupids\npeeping round the mythologic event; and Armide herself has pretty\nFrench lips that knew no Greek.\n\nOnce secure of his position, he straightway flung the last remnants of\nthe academic style out of his studio door; and it is a grim comment on\ncriticism that it was just exactly in proportion as he developed his\nown personal genius and uttered the France of his day, that he was\nattacked; whilst the stilted things that he knew were third-rate, and\nwhich he wholly rejected from henceforth, were exactly the things that\nwere praised!\n\nHis election to the Academy, and the enthusiasm over the picture that\nwon him his seat thereat, brought his name before the young king; the\nfollowing year he received his first order from the Court whose\npainter he was destined to become. The decorations in the queen's\napartments were gloomy and had grown black; and he painted in their\nstead the \"Charity,\" \"Abundance,\" \"Fidelity,\" and \"Prudence\" still\nthere to be seen. Indeed, with his gay vision, his pretty habit of\nculling only the flowers from the garden of life, and his quickness to\nset down the pleasing thing in every prospect, Boucher was the\ndestined painter of a Court weary of pomposity and the pose of the\nmock-heroic, and which was wholly giving itself up to pleasure and the\nelegances.\n\nBut neither his new dignity of Academician nor the royal favour, kept\nhim from the bookshops; and he illustrated, with rare beauty and a\ncharm worthy of Watteau, the great edition of the Works of Moli\u00e8re\nin his thirty-first year. It is true that he made as free with\nMoli\u00e8re's world as with the Gods of Olympus; he peoples the plays with\ncharacters of his own day, arrayed in the dress and habit of that day,\nand moving in surroundings that he saw about him.\n\n\nLE MONDE QUI S'AMUSE\n\n\nThe Homely had come upon the town out of Holland, painted with most\nconsummate artistry by Chardin, and was soon in the vogue. Boucher had\na quick eye for the mode. And he straightway set himself to the\npainting of \"La Belle Cuisini\u00e8re.\" Still-life and homely subjects need\nan accuracy of realism and a Dutch sense of these things, a sense of\nsincerity and an appreciation of the dignity of the work-a-day life of\nthe people, in which Boucher was wholly lacking. Above all, it calls\nfor a sense of \"character,\" which, in Boucher, was always weak. It was\na sneer against him that his very broomsticks called for pompons and\nribbons--and there was more than a little truth in the spite. He is\nmore concerned with the accident of the kissing of a kitchen-maid than\nwith the kitchen's habit. He cannot even peep into a scullery without\ndragging in Venus by the skirts, and tricking her out in a\nproperty-wardrobe of a scullery-wench, in which the girl is clearly\nbut acting the part.\n\nHowever, these passing vogues and experiments in different methods\nwere only gay asides--he was working the while upon his own subjects;\nand, to the display by its several members ordered by the Academy, he\nsent four little paintings of fauns and cupids which won him the\nhonour of election as deputy-professor. His brain and hand were very\nbusy, and he turns from one thing to another with amazing facility,\nbringing distinction to all that he does.\n\nBut he painted about this time two pictures of infants, \"L'Amour\nOiseleur\" and \"L'Amour Moissonneur,\" which were the beginning of that\nhost of cupids that he let fly from his studio; they frolic across his\ncanvases and join the retinue of Venus, peeping out from clouds, over\nwaves, round curtains, painted with a perfection that has never been\nsurpassed in the portrayal of infants. He painted their round limbs,\ntheir lusty life, their delightful awkwardnesses, their jolly fat\ngrace, their na\u00efve surprise at life and glory in it, as they had never\nbeen painted before, and have never been painted since.\n\nHe also gave forth in this his thirty-third year a \"Pastoral\" and a\n\"Shepherd and Shepherdess in Conversation,\" with sheep about them and\nin a pleasant landscape, which were his first essays in the style that\nhe created and which made him famous.\n\nHis friend Meissonnier, the inventor of the rococo, stood godfather to\nBoucher's first-born son in the May of 1736.\n\nFrom the very beginning Boucher seems to have been engraved. And these\nengravings, done by the best gravers of his day, greatly extended his\nreputation and popularised him; he fully realised the value of the\nadvertisement as well as his profits from it. Before his thirty-third\nyear was run out he published his well-known \"Cries of Paris.\"\n\nBoucher's description of them, \"studies from the low classes,\" holds\nthe key to that something of failure to realise the dramatic verities\nthat is over all; it gives also the attitude of the France that he\nknew towards the France that he did not, and could not understand. He\ncreated that dainty, pleasant atmosphere that comes floating up to the\nwindows on a fresh morning in Paris from the musical cries of\nthe street vendors; but of the deeper significance of the\nstreet-sellers--of the miserable accent in their life, of their weary\ntoil, of the dignity of their labour--he knew nothing; his brush could\nnot refrain from making elegance and fine manners peep from behind the\nstreet-porter's fustian or the milkmaid's skirt.\n\nBut his thirty-third year was to contain a more far-reaching\nsignificance even than the creation of his cupid-pieces and pastorals.\n\nThe \"Cries of Paris\" were scarce printed when Boucher's illustration\nto \"Don Quixote\" appeared--\"Sancho pursued by the servants of the\nDuke.\" This design was to have far-reaching results that Boucher\nlittle suspected.\n\nThe painter Oudry had been called to the conduct of the great tapestry\nlooms at Beauvais a couple of years before; and in his efforts to\nfurnish the looms with good designs, he now called Boucher to his aid,\nwhose original and fresh style, colour, and arrangement, together with\nhis personal vision, and the enthusiasm and zeal with which he threw\nhimself into the work, at once increased the reputation and the\nproducts of the famous looms. This large designing for the tapestries\nwas, in return, of immense value to the development of the genius of\nthe man, enlarging his breadth of style and giving scope to that great\ndecorative sense that was his superb gift. Thenceforth he was destined\nto play a supreme part in the history of the world-famed factories. He\nnow produced painting after painting for the Beauvais looms.\n\nLife is now one long triumph for Boucher, only disturbed in this year\nby the sad news of the suicide of his old master, Lemoyne. It was in\nthis, Boucher's thirty-fourth year, that the Salon was opened for the\nfirst time since Boucher's infancy, and he contributed several\ncanvases to it.\n\nRigaud, the old Academician, now close upon eighty, straggling through\nthe great galleries, might well blink and gasp at the change that had\ncome over French art since he last exhibited there, thirty-three years\ngone by; but his scoffs and regrets held no terrors for the younger\nAcademicians gathered about. He stood in a new world. A new generation\nwas in possession. The grand manner, the severe etiquette, formal\nmock-heroics, and solemn pomposity of Louis the Fourteenth were\nvanished, and the Agreeable and the Pleasant Make-Believe of Louis the\nFifteenth reigned in their stead. Old Rigaud might blink indeed! Just\nas the imposing and stilted etiquette of the reception-room had given\nplace to the easy manners and airy etiquette of the dainty boudoir, so\nhad light chatter and gay wit and the quick repartee usurped the heavy\nsplendours of a consequential age. France, weary of an eternal pose of\nthe grand manner, was seeking change in joyousness and amusement.\n\nGallantry and gaiety were become the object of the ambition of a\ndandified and elegant day. France became a coquette; dressed herself\nas a porcelain shepherdess; and with beribboned crook and sheep,\nseeking pleasant prospects to stroll through, gave herself to\ndalliance--her powder-puff and patch-box and fan a serious part of her\nunseriousness.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE CH\u00c2TEAUROUX\n\n\nAt thirty-five Boucher has arrived. He is in the vogue; in favour at\nCourt--as well as in the fashion. In his three years from taking his\nseat at the Academy to the opening of the first Salon he has created a\nnew and original style--his cupid pieces, his pastorals, his\nVenus-pieces, his tapestry. Boucher's kingdom lay in the realm of the\ndecorative painter--and he has found it. Torn from the surroundings\nfor which he designed them, as part and parcel of the general scheme,\nhis pictures are as out of place as an Italian altarpiece in an\nEnglish dining-room, yet they suffer less. Several may still be seen,\nas he set them up in frames of his own planning, as overdoors in the\npalace of the Soubise, now given up to the national archives.\n\nThe ghost of the Prince of Soubise, who commissioned them, may haunt\nhis palace, but his kin know the place no longer. The overdoors\nwrought by Boucher's skill look down now on the nation's collection of\nhistoric documents. The \"Three Graces enchaining Love,\" the fine\npastoral of \"The Cage,\" and the pastoral of the \"Shepherd placing a\nRose in his Shepherdess's Hair,\" were to see a mightier change than\nthe usurpation of Louis the Fourteenth's pompous age by the elegant\nyears of Louis the Fifteenth. But this was not as yet. Here at least\nwe see Boucher's art rid of all outside influences, and at the full\ntide of creation; here we have the inimitable lightness of touch, the\nfigures and landscape bathed in the airy volume of atmosphere.\n\nHe seems at this time to have played with pastel, due probably to his\nfriendship with Latour, who sent a portrait of Boucher's wife to this\nSalon. Boucher showed in the use of chalks the artistry and skill that\nwere always at his command.\n\nHe also was putting to its full use his innate sense of landscape,\nraising to high achievement that astonishing balance of landscape and\nfigures in his design--a balance that has never been surpassed; his\nfigures never override his landscape; his landscape never overpowers\nhis figures. His earnest counsels to his pupils and his constant\ndeploring of the lack of the landscape art in France prove the great\nstress he laid upon it.\n\nThe designing of a frontispiece for the catalogue of a personal\nfriend, one Gersaint, a merchant of oriental wares, started Boucher in\nhis thirty-third year upon that series of Chinese pictures and\ntapestries known as the \"Chinoiseries,\" in which he frittered away\nonly too many precious hours, for they were received with great favour\nby the public. The paintings of Chinese subjects designed for the\nlooms of Beauvais are still to be seen at Besan\u00e7on.\n\nBut busy as were his brain and hand in the exercise of his wide and\nversatile gifts, pouring out \"Chinoiseries,\" illustrations for books,\ntapestries on a large scale, landscapes, models for the gilt bronze\ndecorations of porcelain vases, scheming handsome frames for his\npictures, designing furniture and fans--Boucher was true, above all,\n\"to his goddess,\" and painted the famed \"Birth of Venus,\" which,\nthanks to the Swedish Ambassador's fondness for Madame Boucher, now\nhangs at Stockholm; our amorous Count de Tessin, to be just, seems to\nhave had a rare flair for the artistic--besides artist's wives. It was\non the 15th of April in 1742, the last year of his thirties, that the\nRoyal favour was marked by the grant of a pension of 400 livres\n(double florins) to Boucher with promise of early benefits to follow.\n\nTwo years afterwards it was raised to 600 livres.\n\nThis was the year that he painted the beautiful canvas of \"Diana\nleaving the Bath with one of her Companions,\" now at the Louvre. It\nwas also the year that saw his landscape, the \"Hamlet of Iss\u00e9\" at the\nSalon. This \"Hameau d'Iss\u00e9\" was to be enlarged for the Opera, proving\nhim to be decorator there, where he was arranging waterfalls,\ncascades, and the rest of the pretty business, without staying his\nhand from his art.\n\nAt forty Boucher has come into his kingdom. The ten years of these\nforties were to be a vast triumph for him. He was to produce\nmasterpiece after masterpiece. His art had caught the taste of the\nday. He was at the height of his powers. He had done great things--he\nwas to do greater. During these ten years of his forties he poured\nforth vivid and glowing works of sustained power and originality.\n\nWe have a picture of him as he was in the flesh at this time--the\npastel portrait by Lundberg, now at the Louvre--a gay, somewhat\ndissipated, handsomely dressed dandy of the time, smiling out of his\ncareless day, the debonnair man of fashion, the laughing eyes showing\nsigns of the night carousals, which were the rest from the prodigious\ntoil of this vital and forthright spirit.\n\nIt was in this our artist's fortieth year that the gifted old Cardinal\nFleury, who had guided the fortunes of France with rare skill, died,\nbroken by his ninety years and the blunders of the disastrous war that\nhe had so strenuously opposed; and Louis, essaying the strut of\nkingship, became king by act. His indolent character, unequal to the\nmighty business, his indeterminate will fretted by the set of\nquarrelling and intriguing rogues that he gathered about him as his\nministers, he fell into the habit that became his thenceforth, the\nonly thing to which he paid the tribute of constancy--he ruled France\nfrom behind pretty petticoats. He had early shown the adulterous blood\nof his great-grandfather; two, if not three, of five sisters of the\nnoble and historic house of De Nesle had yielded to his gadding fancy;\nthe youngest now ousted her sister De Mailly from the king's favour,\nwas publicly acknowledged as the king's mistress, and became Duchess\nof Ch\u00e2teauroux. Boucher painted her handsome being as a shepherdess in\none of his pastorals. She was no ordinary toy of a king. A woman of\ntalent, with hot ambitions for the king's majesty, fired with the\npride of race of the old French noblesse, it was during her short\nyears of ascendancy over the king that he roused from his body's\ntorpor and made an effort to reach the dignity and eminence befitting\nto the lord of a great and gallant people. He stepped forth awhile\nfrom his drunken bouts and manifold mean adulteries, and set himself\nat the head of the army in Flanders, and strutted it as conqueror.\n\nPoor Ch\u00e2teauroux only got the hate of the people for reward, Louis the\nhonours; for the people resented the public dishonour of her state.\n\nPower she found to be a dead-sea apple in her pretty mouth. The glory\nof it all, the splendours, were not the easily won delights for which\nshe had looked. She had to fight a duel, that never ended, with the\nking's witty, crafty, and scurrilous Prime Minister, the notorious\nMaurepas--and Maurepas willed that no woman should ever come between\nhim and the king--Maurepas who knew no mercy, no decency, no chivalry,\nno scruple. At Ch\u00e2teauroux's urging, Louis placed himself at the\nhead of the army; and France went near mad with joy that she had\nagain found a king. Crafty Maurepas urged on the business; the\nCh\u00e2teauroux suddenly realised his cunning glee--it separated her from\nthe king.\n\nOut of the whirl of things Boucher's fortune was ripening, little as\nhe might suspect it.\n\nHe was painting masterpieces that make his name live. To his fortieth\nyear belong the famed \"Birth of Venus,\" the \"Venus leaving the Bath,\"\nthe \"Muse Clio,\" the \"Muse Melpomene,\" and the three well-known\npastorals now at the Louvre--\"The Sleeping Shepherdess,\" the \"Nest,\"\n\n\nand the \"Shepherd and Shepherdesses.\" Of the many famous Venus-pieces\nthat his hand painted during these years it is not easy to write the\nlist. But having signed the \"Marriage of Love and Psyche\" at\nforty-one, he turned his experimental hand to the homely, realistic\nDutch style that was having a wide vogue, and painted the\n\"Dejeuner\"--a family of the prosperous class of the day at\nbreakfast--showing with rare charm the surroundings and home life of\nthe well-to-do of his time.\n\nAll goes well with Boucher. He changes into better quarters in the Rue\nde Grenelle-Saint-Honor\u00e9, where he lived for the next five years,\nuntil 1749; but his eyes are fixed upon a studio and apartments at\nthe old palace of the Louvre, though the hard intriguing of his\npowerful friends at Court on his behalf failed for some time. He had,\nindeed, to make another move before he arrived at his longed-for goal.\n\nPensions Boucher, like others, had found to be somewhat empty affairs;\nbut rooms at the Louvre were a solid possession eagerly sought after\nby the artists.\n\nIn this year of 1744 Boucher created a new fashion at the annual Salon\nby sending studies and sketches instead of finished pictures; and it\nset a value upon such things not before realised by artists, for\nsuccess was instant and loud.\n\nTowards the end of the next, Boucher's forty-second year, the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who was to take his leave of Paris,\ncommissioned four pictures to represent the day of a woman of fashion,\nand to be entitled \"Morning,\" \"Midday,\" \"Evening,\" and \"Night.\"\n\nBoucher painted one of these for him, now known as the \"Marchande de\nModes.\" The others were painted later, and all had a wide vogue as\nengravings. The correspondence has interest since it reveals Boucher's\nbusiness habits; he was paid for a picture on its delivery, and for\neach of these he was to receive 600 livres (double florins or\ndollars)--about a hundred and twenty pounds.\n\nIn an official document of the Director of Buildings to the king (or\nMinister of Fine Art, as we should say), written in this year of 1745,\nBoucher being forty-two, is a \"list of the best painters,\" in which\nBoucher is singled out for distinction as \"an historic painter, living\nin the Rue de Grenelle-Saint-Honor\u00e9, opposite the Rue des Deux-Ecus,\npupil of Lemoyne, excelling also in landscape, grotesques, and\nornaments in the manner of Watteau; and equally skilled in painting\nflowers, fruit, architecture, and subjects of gallantry and of\nfashion.\"\n\nNot so bad for dry officialdom; the critics could learn a lesson. For\nhe was nothing less. What indeed does he not do? and wondrous well!\nthis painter of the age.\n\nAnd the mighty rush of events is about to sweep him into further\nprominence; the very things which he probably passed by with a gay\nshrug are to enrich him, to help him to his highest fulfilment.\n\nPoor Ch\u00e2teauroux saw that she must lose the king's gadding favour in\nthe conflict with Maurepas unless she joined her lord, now with the\narmy. She realised full well that she had created the new Louis of\nAmbition--that her going must bring the people's hate to her. But she\ndared not lose the king. And she went. Maurepas had overdone his\njibings. The indiscretion at once rang through the land; became the\njest of the army--and Maurepas was not far from the bottom of the\nbusiness. The discreet indiscretion of covered ways between the king's\nlodgings and hers only added to the mockeries, and increased the\npeople's hate against, of course, the Ch\u00e2teauroux. Then upon a day in\nAugust the small-pox seized Louis at Metz; poor Ch\u00e2teauroux fought for\npossession of the king in the sick room, until his fear of\ndeath--Louis' sole piety--sent her packing--shrinking back in the\nhired carriage at each halting-place for change of horses, lest she\nshould be seen and torn from her place and destroyed by the populace.\n\nBut Louis recovered; Paris rang with bells at joy on his recovery, and\nhe entered the city amidst mad enthusiasm, hailed as The Well-Beloved.\n\nHe sent for the Ch\u00e2teauroux to find her dying, Maurepas having to\ndeliver the message of recall. She died suddenly and in great agony,\nswearing that Maurepas had poisoned her--died in the arms of her poor\ndiscarded sister, the De Mailly.\n\nBut this year of 1745 Boucher hears a mightier scandal that is to mean\nvast things to all France--and not least of all to Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE POMPADOUR\n\n\nA young bride had become the gossip of the rich merchant society of\nParis--that class that was ousting the old noblesse from power. She\nwas a beautiful, a remarkable woman; her wit was repeated in the\ndrawing-rooms, she had all the accomplishments; her charming\nname--Madame Lenormant d'Etioles.\n\nDraw aside the curtains of the past and we discover our little Jeanne\nPoisson--grown into this exquisite creature. It has come about in\nstrange fashion enough. The father--a scandalous fellow--having\nfingered the commissariat moneys in ugly ways to his own use, had been\nbanished for the ugly business. Nor is Jeanne's mother any better than\nshe should be; and the wags wink knowingly at the handsome and rich\nman of fashion, Monsieur Lenormant de Tournehem, who has been the\nfavoured gallant during the absence of the light-fingered Poisson.\n\nAnd, of a truth, Lenormant de Tournehem takes astonishing interest in\nthe little Jeanne--watching over her up-growing and giving her the\nbest of education at the convent, where she wins all hearts, and is\nknown as \"the little queen.\" The truth spoken with wondrous prophecy,\nif unthinkingly, as we shall see. Complacent Poisson came home, and\ntook the rich and fashionable, bland and smiling Lenormant de\nTournehem to his arms. Has he not wealth and estates? therefore as\nexcellent a friend for Poisson as for Madame Poisson. The girl Jeanne\nleaves the convent to be taught the accomplishments by the supreme\nmasters of France, the wits foregather at Madame Poisson's, and the\nbrilliant Jeanne is soon mistress of the arts--coquetry not least of\nall; has also the most exquisite taste in dress. Under all is a heart\ncold as steel; calculating as the higher mathematics. She has but one\nhindrance to ambition--her mean birth. Lenormant de Tournehem rids her\neven of this slur by making his nephew, Lenormant d'Etioles, marry\nher, giving the young couple half his fortune for dowry, and the\npromise of the rest when he dies--also he grants him a splendid\ntown-house, as splendid a country seat. And consequential\nself-respecting little Lenormant d'Etioles is lord of Etioles, amongst\nother seignories. So Jane Fish appears as Madame Lenormant d'Etioles,\nseductive, beautiful, accomplished, to whose house repair the new\nphilosophy, the wits, and artists. She has a certain sense of virtue;\nindeed openly vows that no one but the king shall ever come between\nher and her lord. But, deep in her heart, she has harboured a fierce\nambition--that the king shall help her to keep her bond. She puts\nforth all her gifts, all her powers, to win to the strange goal;\nconfides it to her worldly mother and \"uncle,\" Lenormant de Tournehem;\nfinds keen allies therein to the reaching of that strange goal. The\ndeath of the Ch\u00e2teauroux clears the way. At a masked ball the king is\nintrigued as to the personality of a beautiful woman who plagues him\nwith her art; he orders the unmasking. Madame Lenormant d'Etioles\nstands revealed, drops her handkerchief as by accident; the whisper\nruns through the Court that \"the handkerchief has been thrown!\" The\nking stoops and picks it up. A few evenings later she is smuggled into\nthe \"private apartments.\" She goes again a month later; in the morning\nis seized with sudden terror--she daren't go back to her angry lord\nlest he do her grievous harm; he will have missed her. The king is\ntouched; allows her to hide from henceforth in the secret apartments;\npromises the beautiful creature a lodging, her husband's banishment,\nand early acknowledgment as titular mistress--before the whole Court\nat Easter, says the pious Great One. But he has to join the army to\nplay the Conqueror at Fontenoy; and it is later in the year\n(September) before Madame d'Etioles is presented to the Court in a\nvast company and proceeds to the queen's apartments to kiss hands on\nappointment. Thus was Jeanne Poisson raised to the great aristocracy\nof France in her twenty-third year as Marquise de Pompadour.\n\nBoucher had been one of the brilliant group of artists of the\nd'Etioles' circle. That the Pompadour's influence had much effect upon\nhis position at Court for a year or two is unlikely; for she had to\nfight for possession of the king day and night, as the Ch\u00e2teauroux\nhad done, against the queen's party and the unscrupulous enmity of\nMaurepas. To set down Boucher's favour at Court to her is ridiculous.\n\nHe was painting for the queen's apartments at thirty-one when the\nPompadour was a school-girl of twelve. But in the year following her\nrise to power, Boucher painted four pictures for the large room of the\nDauphin, which were \"placed elsewhere\"; and, the year after that, he\nwas at work upon two pictures for the bedroom of the king at the\ncastle of Marly. It is likely enough that the Pompadour directed this\norder. She had almost immediately secured the office of the\nDirector-General of Buildings, which covered the direction of the\nroyal art treasures, for \"uncle\" Lenormant de Tournehem, who was also\na friend of the artist. And from this year it is significant that\nBoucher paints no more for the opposing camp of the Queen and Dauphin.\n\nHe was now giving all his strength to the \"Rape of Europa\" that he\npainted for the competition ordered by the Academy at the command of\nLenormant de Tournehem in the king's name, in which ten chosen\nAcademicians were to paint subjects in their own style for six prizes\nand a gold medal, to be awarded in secret vote by the competing\nartists themselves. Boucher won, by his amiable nature, the good-will\nof them all by proposing that they should so arrange as to share the\nprizes equally, and thus prevent any sense of soreness inevitable in\nthe losers.\n\nBut greatly as he won the good-fellowship of his fellow-artists by it,\nthis picture caused a murmur to rise amongst the critics who,\naforetime loud in his praise, now began to complain of his \"abuse of\nrose tints\" in the painting of the female nude. The fact was that\nDiderot and the men of the New Philosophy were turning their eyes to\nthe whole foundations upon which France was built, art as well as\nsociety, and were beginning to demand of art \"grandeur and morality in\nits subjects.\" They were soon to be clamouring for \"the statement of a\ngreat maxim, a lesson for the spectator.\" Diderot, with bull-like\ncourage, picked out the greatest, and turned upon Boucher, blaming him\nfor triviality.\n\nThe nations, weary of war, concluded the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in\nthe October of 1748. No sooner was peace concluded than Louis\nrelapsed into his old habit of dandified indolence and profligate\nease; and, putting from him his duties as the lord of a great people,\nhe gave himself up to shameless intrigues. He allowed the Pompadour to\nusurp his magnificence and to rule over the land. He yielded himself\nutterly, if sometimes sulkily, to her domination; and for sixteen\nyears she was the most powerful person at Court, the greatest force in\nthe state--making and unmaking ministers, disposing of office,\nhonours, titles, pensions. All political affairs were discussed and\narranged under her guidance; ministers, ambassadors, generals\ntransacted their business in her stately boudoirs; the whole patronage\nof the sovereign was dispensed by her pretty hands; the prizes of the\nChurch, of the army, of the magistracy could be obtained solely\nthrough her favour and good-will. Her energy must have been\nprodigious. Possessed of extraordinary talents and exquisite tastes,\nshe gave full rein to them, and it was in the indulgence of her better\nqualities that Destiny brought Boucher into the friendship of this\nwonderful woman. She became not only his patron but his pupil,\nengraving several of his designs.\n\nBut this, her sovereignty over the king, easy and light in its outward\nseeming, was a haggard nightmare to the calculating woman who had so\nlonged for it. She knew no single hour's rest from the night she won\nto the king's bed. She had to fight her enemies, secret and open, for\npossession of the king's will, day and night; and she fought--with\nrare courage. She won by consummate skill and unending pluck. She made\nherself an essential part of the king's freedom from care. The Court\nparty fought her for power with constant vigilance. Maurepas brought\nall his unscrupulous art, all his ironic mimicry, all his vile jibes\nand unchivalrous hatred to bear against her. He had made himself a\nnecessity to the king; and he never slept away a chance of injuring\nher. He knew no mercy, no nobility, no pity. He made her the detested\nobject of the people. With his own hands he penned the witty verses\nand epigrams that were sung and flung about the streets of Paris.\n\nBut she had an enemy more subtle than any at the Court--hour by hour\nshe had to dispute the king with the king's boredom. And it was in the\neffort to do so that she created her celebrated theatre in the\nprivate apartments, calling Boucher and others to her aid in the doing\nof it. Here the noblest of France vied with each other to obtain the\nsmallest part to play, an instrument in its orchestra, an invitation\nto its performances.\n\nBoucher left the Opera to become its decorator in 1748, and did not\nreturn until her death. For her, he also decorated her beautiful rooms\nat Bellevue. She bought at high prices many of his greatest\nmasterpieces.\n\nThe Pompadour's power so greatly increased that she openly took\ncommand of the king's will; dared and succeeded in getting his\nfavourite Maurepas banished; and herself took to the use of the kingly\n\"we.\" Her rascally father was created Lord of Marigny; her brother,\nwhom the king liked well and called \"little brother,\" was created\nMarquis de Vandi\u00e8res; her only child, Alexandrine, signed her name as\na princess of the blood royal, and would have been married to the\nblood royal had she not caught the small-pox and died. She amassed a\nprivate fortune, castles, and estates such as no mistress had dreamed\nof; and into them she poured art treasures that cost the nation\nthirty-six millions of money. She created the porcelain factory of\nS\u00e8vres, kept keen watch over the Gobelins looms, and founded the great\nMilitary School of St. Cyr amidst work that would have kept several\nstatesmen busy, and of deadly intrigues at Court that would have\nbroken the spirit of many a brilliant man.\n\nIt was in her hectic desire to keep the king from being bored that she\nstooped, and made Boucher stoop, to the employment of his high\nartistry in the painting of a series of indecent pictures wherewith to\ntickle the jaded desires of Boredom, and thereby gave rise to the\nwidespread impression that Boucher's art was ever infected by base\ndesign. But Boucher was, at his very worst, but a healthy animal; and\neven in these secret works for the king he did not reach so low as did\nmany an artist of more pious memory who painted with no excuse but his\nown pleasure.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the Pompadour has been blamed too much for this\nevil act, and too much forgotten for her splendid patronage of the man\nwho, under it and during these great years of his forties, produced a\nseries of masterpieces that place him in the foremost rank of the\npainters of his century. It is impossible to reckon the number of the\npastorals and Venus-pieces that his master-hand painted and loved to\npaint, during these the supreme years of his genius. It is significant\nthat they were painted during the years that saw the Pompadour in\nsupreme power.\n\nBoucher was so firmly established in 1750, his forty-seventh year,\nthat he moved into a new house in the Rue Richelieu, near the Palais\nRoyal. Disappointed in not receiving a studio and apartments at the\nLouvre, he was allowed to use a studio in the king's library. He was\nnow making money so easily that he was able to collect pictures and\nprecious stones and the gaily coloured curiosities that appealed to\nhis tastes.\n\nThe critics were becoming more and more censorious; and one of them\nhits true with the comment that in his pastorals his shepherdesses\nlook as if they had stepped over from the Opera and would soon be off\nagain thereto.\n\nIn his forty-eighth year Boucher's art was at its most luminous\nstage--his atmosphere clear and subtle and exquisitely rendered; his\nyellows golden; his whites satin-like and silvery; his flesh-tones\nupon the nude bodies of his goddesses unsurpassed by previous art. The\nbeauty of it all was not to last much longer.\n\nLenormant de Tournehem died suddenly in the November of 1751; the\nPompadour's brother, Abel Poisson de Vandi\u00e8res, was appointed\nDirector-General in his stead at the age of twenty-five--and soon\nafterwards, on the death of his father, created Marquis de Marigny--a\nshy, handsome youth, a gentleman and an honourable fellow, whom the\nking liked well, and against whom his sister's sole complaint was that\nhe lacked the brazen effrontery of the courtiers of the day. No man\ndid more for the advancement of the art of his time. A pension of a\nthousand livres falling vacant, the young fellow secured it for\nBoucher; and almost immediately afterwards, a studio becoming vacant\nat the Louvre owing to the death of Coypel, first painter to the king,\nBoucher came to his coveted home, eagerly moving in with his family as\nsoon as its wretched state could be put into repair.\n\nThe decoration of the new wing to the palace at Fontainebleau brought\nthe commission for the painting of the ceiling and the principal\npicture in the Council Chamber to Boucher, who had already decorated\nthe Dining-Room. This was the period of his painting the \"Rising\" and\nthe \"Setting of the Sun\" for the Pompadour, now in the Watteau\ncollection, two canvases that were always favourites with the painter,\nbitterly as they were assailed by the critic Grimm.\n\nHe was turning out so much work that it was impossible to give as much\ncare to his pictures as he ought. For he refused sternly, his life\nlong, to raise his prices; by consequence he had to create a larger\namount of work in order to meet his expenditure. It was about this\ntime that Reynolds, passing through Paris, went to visit him and found\nhim painting on a huge canvas without models or sketches. \"On\nexpressing my surprise,\" writes Reynolds, \"he replied that he had\nconsidered the model as necessary during his youth until he had\ncompleted his study of art, but that he had not used one for a long\ntime past.\"\n\nHe soon had not the time, not only to paint from nature but even to\ngive his pictures the work necessary to complete them. The feverish\nhaste which took possession of him in his frantic endeavour to meet\nthe vast demand for his pictures, and the eager efforts of his\nengravers to satisfy the public call for engravings after his works,\ngave him less and less leisure to joy in their doing. And his eyesight\nbegan to fail. His flesh-tints deepened to a reddish hue; and he\nstands baffled before his work, suspecting his sight, since what every\none cries out upon as being bright vermilion, he only sees as a dull\nearthy colour. Boucher has topped the height of his achievement; he\nhas to \"descend the other side of the hill.\" Boucher begins to grow\nold.\n\nIn Boucher's fifty-first year an ugly intrigue of the queen's party at\nCourt to sap the Pompadour's influence over the king by drawing away\nthe king's affections towards Madame de Choiseul-Romanet, a reckless\nyoung beauty of the Court, brought about a strange alliance. The Count\nde Stainville, one of the Pompadour's bitterest enemies, was shown the\nking's letter of invitation to his young kinswoman; and he, deeply\nwounded in his pride that his kinswoman should have been offered to\nthe king, went to the Pompadour and exposed the plot. A close\nalliance followed; and De Stainville thenceforth became her chief\nguide in affairs of state. It was at her instance that the king called\nhim to be his Prime Minister, raising him to the Duchy of Choiseul--a\nname he made illustrious as one of the greatest Ministers of France.\n\nIn his fifty-second year Boucher was appointed to the directorship of\nthe Gobelins looms, to the huge delight of the weavers and all\nconcerned with the tapestry factory. This was the year of his painting\nthe famous portrait of the Pompadour, to whom he several times paid\nthis \"tribute of immorality.\" For the Gobelins looms he produced many\nhandsome designs; and he was painting with astounding industry. But\nhis hand's skill began to falter. His art shows weariness in his\nsixtieth year, and sickness fell upon him, and held him in servitude\nnow with rare moments of respite. The critics, notoriously Diderot,\nwere now attacking him with shameless virulence. Boucher passed it all\nby; but he felt the change that was taking place in the public taste.\n\nThe ideas of the New Philosophy were infecting public opinion; the Man\nof Feeling had arisen in the land; and France, humiliated in war, and\nresenting the follies and the greed of her shameless privileged class,\nwas openly resenting it and all its works. Choiseul had planted his\nstrength deep in the people's party, and was come near to being its\ngod. His masterly mind had checked Frederick of Prussia to the North;\nand the nations, exhausted by the struggle, signed the Peace of Paris\nin 1763. Choiseul, with France at peace abroad, turned to the blotting\nout of the turbulent order of the Jesuits at home. Their attempt to\nend the Pompadour's relations with the king made this powerful woman\neager to complete his design; the chance was soon to come, and the\nOrder was abolished from France and its vast property seized by the\nstate.\n\nThe Pompadour lived but a short while to enjoy her triumph. Worn out\nby her superhuman activities, assailed by debt, she fell ill of a\nracking cough, dying on the 15th of April, 1764, in her forty-second\nyear, keeping her ascendancy over the king and the supreme power in\nFrance to her last hour. Death found her transacting affairs of state.\n\nLouis, weary of his servitude, had only a heartless epigram to cast\nat the body of the dead woman as she passed to her last resting-place.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE END\n\n\nThe death of the Pompadour robbed Boucher of a friend; but her\nbrother, Marigny, remained faithfully attached to the old artist, and\nseized every chance to honour him. On the death of Carle van Loo,\nBoucher, at sixty-two, was made first painter to the king, with all\nhis pensions and privileges that were consistent with this the supreme\nappointment in the art world.\n\nThere had been serious intention of making Boucher the head of the\nEcole des El\u00e8ves Proteg\u00e9s; he had the art of making himself liked and\nof inspiring the love of the arts. He was very popular with the\nstudents and artists, owing to his kindliness, his eagerness to render\nservice, his readiness to encourage the youngsters or to console them.\n\nWhen the riot took place, provoked by the Academicians by their award\nof the Prix de Rome in 1767, the students insulted the Academicians,\nbut hailed Boucher with enthusiastic applause. The reason was not far\nto seek. When a student came to the old master for advice he did not\n\"play the pontiff,\" and, scorning the false dignity of big phrases, he\ntook the brush in his hand and showed the way out of all difficulties\nby simplehearted example, despising rules, and putting himself out in\norder to make things clear to a young artist.\n\nHowever, the Academicians feared he would be an unorthodox master for\nyouth, and appointed another in his place.\n\nA long and serious illness thwarted his keen energies. Diderot was\ngiving himself up to outrageous violence against him. If the old\npainter exhibited at the Salon, Diderot fiercely assailed his art; if\nhe did not exhibit, Diderot as bitterly assailed him for his\nnegligences. Above all, he attacked Boucher in that he did not paint\nwhat Diderot would have painted--but could not. \"When he paints\ninfants,\" cries Diderot, \"you will not find one employed in a real act\nof life--studying his lesson, reading, writing, stripping hemp.\"\n\nPoor unfortunate infants! for whom Philosophy could find no happier\njoy in life than stripping hemp! Boucher was but an artist. He\npainted his generation as far as he could see it, and, with all his\nfaults and weaknesses, he never debauched his art with foreign and\nalien things that had no part in the nation's life; he painted fair\nFrance into his landscapes, not a make-believe land he did not know\nwith preposterous Greek ruins; and best of all, to his eternal honour,\nhe painted infants glad in their gladness to be alive, with no desire\nto send their happy little bodies to school, with no sickly ambition\nto make them into budding philosophers, with no thought of making them\npose and lie as Men of Feeling. He had no joy in setting their little\nbodies to toil--in making them \"teach a lesson to the spectator,\" in\nmaking them stoop their little shoulders to the \"picking of hemp.\"\n\nHe continued to paint as he had always painted--except that he painted\nless well. The wreath of roses was wilting on a grey head. The blood\njigged less warmly in the frail body. The features showed pallid--the\neyes haggard. The sight failed. The hand alone kept something of its\ncunning.\n\nHe went to Holland with his friend Randon du Boisset, but health\nshrank farther from him. Diderot had near spent his last jibe.\n\nIn 1768, Boucher's sixty-fifth year, the neglected queen went to her\ngrave. The king's grief and contrition and vows to amend his life came\ntoo late, and lasted little longer than the drying of the floods of\ntears over the body of his dead consort. A year later he was become\nthe creature of a pretty woman of the gutters, whom he caused to be\nmarried to the Count du Barry--the infamously famous Madame du Barry.\n\nBut neither the remonstrances of Choiseul with the king against this\nfurther degradation of the throne of France, nor his unconcealed scorn\nof the upstart countess, nor the dangerous enemy he made for himself\nthereby, signified now to Boucher, first painter to the king.\n\nBoucher was failing. His son was a prig and a disappointment. His two\nfavourite pupils, Baudoin and Deshayes, who had married his two girls,\ndied.\n\nTo the Salon of 1769 he sent his \"Caravan of Bohemians.\" It was his\nlast display. He had been going about for some time like a gaunt ghost\nof his former self, afflicted with all the ills inevitable to a life\nfeverishly consumed in work and the pursuit of pleasure.\n\nThey went to his studio at five of the clock one May morning, and\nfound him seated at his easel, before a canvas of Venus, dead, with\nthe paint-filled brush fallen out of his fingers.\n\nSo passed he away on the 30th of May 1770, in his sixty-seventh year.\n\nWhen Boucher died, the generation of which he was the limner was near\ncome to its violent end. The rosy carnivals and gay gallantries of his\nage gave way to the blood-stained romance and fierce tempest of the\nRevolution. The garrets of the old curiosity-shops received the\ndiscarded canvases of the master. His shepherds and shepherdesses were\nput to rout by the Romans of his pupil, citizen David. The old order\nwas brought into contempt and overthrown. And with it, Boucher's art,\nlike much that was gracious and charming and good in the evil thing,\nwent down also, and was overwhelmed for a while.\n\nFor a while only. For just as, out of the blood and terror of the\nRevolution, a real France arose, phnix-wise, from the ruin, and in\nbeing born, whilst putting off the vilenesses of the thing from which\nshe sprang, took on also to herself the gracious and winsome qualities\nthat place her amongst the most fascinating peoples of the ages; so\nBoucher has come into his kingdom again--the most gracious of painters\nthat the years have yielded."

                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n        a. One bed, or folding cot,\n        b. One oil stove,\n        c. One lamp,\n        d. Enough supplies of all kinds sufficient for six months,\n        e. Pots, pans, kettles, etc.\nIt is needless to say that positions in Manila and Iloilo were now at\na premium.\n\nWas it possible that teachers were to be sent to places where even the\nnecessaries of life could not be obtained! Was it possible that many\nwould be sent to places so remote that for six months no fresh\nsupplies could be gotten! A mass meeting was held at once, and a\ncommittee was appointed to send a cablegram to the Associated Press\npetitioning aid from the American people at large. Realizing what\nconsternation would be created throughout the United States by such a\nmessage, two of the teachers leaped into a carriage at the close of\nthe meeting and a few moments later were closeted with the chief\nexecutive of the department. As a result the committee was persuaded\nnot to send the cablegram to the Associated Press until by courtesy it\nhad been sent to the President. Of course, this diplomatic move tided\naffairs over and the teachers who had flatly refused to budge from\nManila now agreed to go on to their stations, being assured that\nwhatever action was best would be taken.\n\nThe day had come when we must separate. We were to enter an untried\nand an unknown field. It was fitting that we have a final joyous\nmeeting, so the best orchestra in the archipelago was engaged and we\n\"chased the hours with flying feet\" until dawn so that whatever might\ncome to us in that unknown future upon which we were entering each\nwould hold in pleasant memory our last evening together.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER III. - A DRAMA IN ACTUAL LIFE.\n\n\nAlmost every one heeded the warning to go to his station forearmed\nwith at least necessaries of life, but, as it had never fallen to the\nlot of the writer to cook, he refused to learn at that late day, so he\ntook no pot, no pan, no kettle, putting his future into the hands of\nan uncertain fate and relying upon the unknown hospitality of the\nFilipino.\n\nBacalod, the capital of the province of Occidental Negros, was our\ndestination. The second morning after leaving Manila, we awoke with\nthe \"Kilpatrick\" lying at anchor in a shallow bay. We were several\nmiles from the shore and nothing in sight indicated that we had\nreached a place of any importance. Late the night before we had been\nawakened by the loud, sharp ringing of the ship's bells, accompanied\nby the reversal of the engines and a general disturbance awaking the\ncrew. So our first impressions on coming on deck were that we had run\naground. But the captain assured us that everything was ship-shape and\nthat this was the nearest point of approach to Capiz, a town of\nconsiderable importance on the island of Panay, where a body of troops\nwas to embark for home. Not even the grass hut of a native was in\nsight. Search as we would, not a sign was seen of a stream flowing\ninto the sea, indicating the probable presence of a town. There was\nnot a sign of life of any kind save one lone column of thin, blue\nsmoke that arose from the side of a mountain miles away. One would\nhave thought that we were explorers of three hundred years ago lying\noff the shore of some unknown land.\n\nAfter breakfast the steam launch, together with all the boats, was\nlowered, and several of us who had determined to miss no opportunity\nto gather information about the islands took our places in the launch\nby the side of the ship's mate, and steamed away across the water with\na long line of boats strung out in the rear. We headed away toward a\ngroup of cocoanut trees, and about an hour later stepped ashore on a\npile of decayed coral rocks that extended some twenty or thirty feet\nout into the water, thus forming the only landing place of a town of\nseveral thousands of people and of considerable commercial importance.\n\nA few moments after we had landed, an army wagon drawn by a\nmagnificent pair of mules came up out of a tropical jungle along a\nnarrow road. We clambered into the wagon and were soon lost in the\ndepths of foliage from which we had just seen the vehicle emerge.\n\nLong waving bamboos with their plumy leafage hung over the road from\neach side, meeting and overlapping in the center until they formed an\narchway so dense that the tropical sun now high in the heavens\npenetrated it only at intervals. At times the wagon sank up to the\nhubs in the soft earth, and the muscles of the mules stood out like\nwhip-cords under the skin as they drew us forward.\n\nAt a sharp turn in the road we came upon the first division of troops\nthat was to embark for home. The look of joy upon their sun-browned\nfaces was inexpressible. Their work was done, and with elastic step\nand smiling faces they saluted us as they passed by. The reign of\nforce was at an end; it was going out with them; the reign of peace\nhad begun; it was coming in with us.\n\nIn the afternoon when we returned from the town the last of the troops\nhad arrived and, as we drove up, the bugle was sounding the call to\nsupper. We noticed native women mingling with the troops and, indeed,\na native woman was in constant attention waiting upon one of the\nsoldiers with whom we ate. Her clothes were clean, her hair was nicely\ncombed, and her general appearance was neat. She seemed to anticipate\nthe slightest wish of the soldier with whom she was. She brought him\nwater to drink, cleaned his plate after the meal and saw that his\nknife, fork, and spoon were put into his haversack.\n\nWe had now finished supper and the launch had returned for the last\nload of troops. The lieutenant in command of the company gave the\norder to \"fall in\"; the men shouldered their rifles and fell into\nline. \"Forward, march!\" called the lieutenant, and the column swept\nforward towards the boats. The women had until now restrained\nthemselves, but, as their husbands marched away never to return, their\nfeelings could no longer be restrained. One young woman of about\neighteen, who was leaning against a rock by the roadside sobbing, when\nher husband passed, leaped up in frenzy of passionate love and caught\nthe rifle from his shoulder. Her first impulse seemed to be to throw\nthe gun away, but suddenly realizing the futility of such an act she\nburst into tears, shouldered the rifle herself and marched on by his\nside. Another woman of more mature age threw her arms around the legs\nof a tall stalwart man, and drew him bodily from the line.\n\nBut the troops marched on and entered the boats. One woman who had\nbeen unnoticed before came down into the shallow water and caught hold\nof our last boat as if to prevent its leaving, while others stood\nmingling their sobs with the sounds of the wavelets as they broke on\nthe sands. As we passed away, an expectant mother, standing in bold\noutline against the twilight sky, threw up her hands in an agony of\ndespair and then sank upon the stones. The curtain had fallen upon a\ndrama in actual life deeper in pathos than any other we had ever seen\nor ever expected to see. Depth of passion, depth of love! Who can\nfathom the human heart?\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. - WHAT THE TEACHERS DID.\n\n\nThere is a remarkable sameness about the towns in the Philippines.\n\nThey all have a large open square about the middle of the town, around\nthree sides of which are Chinese stores, unless one side lies open to\nthe sea, and on the fourth is the great stone ecclesia. The streets\nrun at right angles to one another and divide up the town into\ncreditable squares.\n\nEverybody in the Philippines lives up-stairs, for the ground is so\nsoaked with water during the rainy season that it is a menace to\nhealth to live upon the ground floor. So even the poorest nippa hut\nis built upon stakes four or five feet above the ground.\n\nBacalod is a typical Philippine town. As we landed, a broad open\nsquare was spread out before us. Two sides of the square were lined\nwith two-story houses in which were Chinese stores below and Filipino\nhomes above. On the third side stood the great stone church in whose\nmassive tower the clock was striking the hour of four, while the\nfourth lay open to the sea that had borne us thither.\n\nWe landed, but it was in a method new to us and one not usually\nemployed by the traveling public.\n\nWhen our sail boat ran aground on the sandy bottom a hundred yards or\nmore from the shore, a crowd of Filipino men who were on the beach\nslowly rolled up their pantaloons and waded out to the rescue,--for\nthe money that was in it. The boat's crew elevated their trousers'\nlegs also and slided down into the water. Each of us then straddled\nthe neck of a Filipino standing in the water and was held by ankles to\nbe steadied while our biped mounts proceeded to the shore.\n\nWe were now on the ground and face to face with the situation. To give\nthe reader an idea of the actual conditions met by the first teachers\nwho went to the Islands, the following is copied from the instructions\ngiven us in Manila:\n    1. There shall be two sessions daily of all schools, and the\n    last hour of the morning session shall be devoted solely to\n    instructing the Filipino teachers.\n\n    2. In cases where teachers are sent to a town in which there\n    is no school-house, they are expected to secure the aid of the\n    people and have one built.\n\n    3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is\n    stopped.\n\n    4. All supplies must be kept under lock and key. In towns\n    where there is no case or box to lock the supplies in, and it\n    is also impossible to get the town council to furnish a case,\n    a requisition may be sent to Manila, and, if an appropriation\n    can be secured, one will be made and sent out.\n\nThus it can be easily seen that we were indeed pioneers. In many\nplaces no school-house was to be found, and in some cases it was even\ndifficult to get the town council to provide a case in which to keep\nthe supplies.\n\nThe work of the teachers was, in short; to \"make the English language\nthe basis of instruction in the public schools.\" On our arrival at\nBacalod two schools were found in progress, for some soldiers had been\ndetailed for the work here previous to our coming. One of these was\nfor boys and the other, for girls. Thus the work here had been in a\nmeasure simplified, but complications that had arisen at Talisay, one\nof the largest and richest towns on the island, demanded a change of\nteachers and the writer was assigned to the place as superintendent.\n\nHere an attempt had been made to start a school but it had failed\nignominiously and a system of education was to be put into operation\nfrom the very start.\n\nThe Filipinos are not strong advocates of co-education, so separate\nschools were to be started for the boys and the girls. The one for the\nboys was gotten well in hand before the one for the girls was\nattempted at all.\n\nA few days after reaching the town and securing a home the\npresidente of the town had it publicly announced that the following\nMonday morning at eight o'clock a public school for boys would be\nopened in a building that had been rented for the purpose by the\nmunicipal council. About the middle of the afternoon of the same day a\nman beat a little drum throughout all the streets of the town to call\nthe people out and the town clerk announced both in Spanish and in the\nnative language that this public school would begin at the time and\nplace mentioned above; that instruction would be free to all who came;\nthat the government would furnish all supplies; and that instruction\nwould be given in the English language. A native principal and\nassistants were employed and everything was ready to begin.\n\nThe official report of the result is as follows:\n    Boys' public school of Talisay, Negros, P. I., began November\n    4, 1901. Forty-three boys present at eight o'clock. Forty-one\n    of them knew \"good morning\" and \"good afternoon\" but do not\n    know the distinction between them. Two of them speak simple\n    Spanish. At eight forty-five, eight more, who had been\n    attending an early morning private school, came in together.\n\n    The books they brought were so varied and so different from\n    one another that it seemed impossible to bring any reasonable\n    degree of order out of such a chaos, and so, after struggling\n    vainly for about a week with the problem, the superintendent\n    by one fell stroke removed everything in use and put in a\n    uniform system, and from that day on the English language has\n    been the basis of instruction in the public schools of\n    Talisay. The work was of necessity very slow at first, but by\n    the end of a year two schools were going nicely and a number\n    of the brightest boys and girls had made really excellent\n    progress.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER V. - A \"BAILE.\"\n\n\nNot long after the arrival of our party at Bacalod we received an\ninvitation to a \"baile\" given in our honor by the inhabitants of\nSilay, a town some ten or twelve miles up the northern coast and one\nnoted for its social life. The invitation was accepted with pleasure,\nand about the middle of the afternoon on the day appointed we were\nclad in the immaculate white of the tropics and steaming away up the\ncoast on board a launch sent for our conveyance. Twilight was still\nlingering on the path of day when we anchored just off shore at the\ntown. A row-boat containing the officials of the city came out to meet\nus and, in due season, we were ushered into a spacious drawing-room\nfilled almost to overflowing with the \u00e9lite of the town. The \u00e9lite of\ntowns in the Philippines speak Spanish, and, as only one or two of our\nparty could at that time boast of more than a formal acquaintance with\nthe Castilian tongue, the exchange of ideas that evening between us\nand the Filipinos was of necessity not very rapid.\n\nThe necessity of easy communication between us was rendered somewhat\nless indispensable by the announcement of supper as soon as we were\nrested from our trip. When we had taken our places at the table a\nyoung Filipino about twenty-five years of age arose and gave a lengthy\ntoast to the recent union of the Philippines with the United States.\n\nBut as we Americans were unable to scale the dizzy heights of his\nclimaxes or sink to the depths of his pathos, we forewent the\npleasures of his oratory and turned our attention to the savory odor\nof lamb, chicken, and roast pig that came slyly stealing up our\nnostrils to send us nerve dispatches about the gastronomic delights of\nour not far distant future.\n\nAt last the toast was ended and the world-wide soup ushered in a long\ntrain of things good to eat, served in a style better fitted to the\ndelights of the appetite than to the formalities of dinners, for, as\nsoon as the pleasant task of one dish was completed by any one, the\nnext was served him at once regardless of the progress made by the\nothers at the table.\n\nThe last course was dulce. The new-comers to the Philippines will\nnot be long in making the acquaintance of this dish, and at all\nmeetings, both public and private, where eatables are served, it\nperforms an important part. It is anything sweet, and it may vary all\nthe way from an india-rubber-like black mixture of cocoanut milk and\ndirty sugar to a really toothsome and respectable confection. No\nmatter of what materials a dish is composed, just so long as it is\nsweet, it is dulce.\n\nAfter paying our respects to this last course, we arose from the table\nand entered a great rectangular room from the center of whose ceiling\nhung a large glass chandelier, a mass of shimmering crystals. In the\nchairs around the room were the wealth, the youth, and the beauty of\nthe town.\n\nThe first and also the last number of every Filipino dance of any\nformality is the \"rigodon.\" The dancers are arranged in a square, or\nquadrangle according to the number participating, and are then led\nthrough a tangled maze of figures that so utterly bewilders the novice\nthat he sinks into his chair at the end of the dance wondering how it\nall came to pass.\n\nWe Americans breathed a sigh of relief when the \"rigodon\" ended, and\nmustered fresh courage for social conquests in the waltz that was now\nbreathing forth from the trembling strings. My companion in the first\ndance had been the young lady by whose side I had sat at dinner. But\nit now became necessary to search for another, so I prudently waited\nto see how partners were chosen, and made no mistake when a few\nmoments later I faced one of the most luscious looking se\u00f1oritas on\nthe opposite side of the room and offered her my arm. My eyes must\nhave told the story that my lips could not utter in Spanish, for she\nsmiled upon me sweetly, arose, and put her hand upon my shoulder. My\narm encircled her waist and I began to waltz. Unfortunately my\ncompanion did not follow, but began to hop up and down in a manner\nmost distressing. Supposing the attack to be only temporary, I paused\nand, much to my relief, she soon showed signs of recovery; and in the\ncourse of time she came to a standstill looking up into my face in an\ninquiring sort of way, apparently wondering why St. Vitus had not paid\nhis respects to me also. A second attempt to follow the music met with\nresults similar to the first, and during the third attempt, which\nseemed to be trembling on the verge of a failure, St. Vitus let go my\ncompanion and seized me with such vigor that she, who was small even\nfor a Filipino, was gathered up bodily and taken around the room at\nsuch a pace that her toes touched the floor only at far distant\nintervals.\n\nAt this point my devotion to the shrine of Terpsichore ceased from\nforce of circumstances and I seated myself in one of the most\ncomfortable chairs in sight that I might carry out a previously formed\nplan to study the Filipino somewhat critically as he appears in\nsociety.\n\nThe first thing that impressed me as the dancers passed up and down\nthe room was the flash of diamonds. Nearly every woman in the room had\non a brooch that flashed the colors of the rainbow at every turn.\n\nAlmost all of them wore one or more rings that showed up brilliantly\nunder the chandelier. Many of the men too, especially the young men,\nwore gems that appeared to be exquisite. A closer inspection showed\nthat some of the gems had flaws and others were of a poor color, but\nno one would have denied that, taken as a whole, it was a really\nbeautiful display.\n\nThe dress of the ladies was richly colored. Many of their skirts were\nof silk covered with hand embroidered flowers, and their filmy pina\nwaists and broad collar pieces were rich with needle-work. They all\nwore a kind of heelless velvet slipper, very common as a dress shoe in\nthe Philippines, or high-heeled patent leather shoes with neatly\nfitting black stockings.\n\nThe men were dressed in white coats and white pantaloons or black\ncoats and white pantaloons. White shirts and collars, together with\nall sorts and styles of cravats and low-cut patent leather shoes with\nhighly colored socks completed their dress.\n\nIt was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money;\nthat they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a\ntable loaded with good things was a fact to which all of us were\nenthusiastic witnesses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VI. - A SKETCH OF LIFE IN THE PHILIPPINES.\n\n\nHouse-keeping in the Philippines presents some interesting phases. Our\nclub of American officials decided to run a mess, so we employed a\ncook and a house boy, then each of us provided himself with a personal\nservant, making a total of six servants for four men--it takes about\nthis proportion of servants to live in any sort of comfort in the\nPhilippines--and launched ourselves boldly upon the sea of domestic\neconomy. But there were shoals ahead of us, for the question of\nregulating servants is one of no small importance in the Philippines,\nand one of its most disadvantageous features is the long chain of\ndependents that usually attends it.\n\nWe gave the cooks so much a day with which to buy supplies in the\nlocal market, for our own table, making him render a daily list of\nexpenditures, and a fixed amount besides to purchase rice and fish for\nhimself and the other servants. Of course, if they wished to vary\ntheir diet and get chicken and fresh pork, which could be had at far\ndistant intervals, it was wholly a matter of their option, but the\nallowance was made on the basis of so much rice and fish a day for\neach. This allowance was about fifteen cents a day in Spanish coin per\nservant.\n\nThus far all was well. We had agreed to give the cook eight dollars a\nmonth in Spanish money, thinking that good wages would procure good\nservice, but the visions of affluence that floated before him on such\nfloods of wealth were so alluring that they drew him from the kitchen\nto the cooler veranda. In less than a week he had employed an\nassistant at four dollars a month; in less than another week that\nassistant had employed him an assistant at two dollars a month; in\nless than another week that assistant to the assistant had employed\nhim an assistant at the princely salary of fifty cents a month; and\nfrom fear that the chain of dependents would end only by our having\nthe whole Filipino race attached to our culinary force, we broke up\nhouse-keeping and went boarding again, choosing that as the less of\nthe two evils.\n\nOur house furnishings were almost wholly Philippine. The table ware\nand the food on the table came from the ends of the earth. The knives\nand forks were made in Germany, the plates were manufactured in\nEngland, the glass ware and table cloth, in the United States. The\noatmeal and flour came from the United States also. The butter came\nfrom Australia, the rice from China, the salt from Russia, and the\nother eatables from sources about as various as their separate names.\n\nSwitzerland furnished the condensed milk and Illinois the canned\ncream. Nearly all of the canned fruit bore labels from Spain.\n\nThus it can easily be seen that life in the Philippines, if lived\naccording to American ideals, is dependent upon a highly developed and\nhighly complex commerce. However, the difficulties of transportation\nand the restriction of large stocks of merchandise to Manila and some\nhalf a dozen other towns, make so great a difference between country\nlife and city life that a short comparison of the two will not be out\nof place, and life in Manila may well be taken as being fairly typical\nof the latter.\n\nLife in Manila is pleasant, but expensive. It is pleasant from the\nfact that it is not only the capital but also metropolis of the\narchipelago. Thus the combination of wealth and high official position\nhas given to Manila a society of the highest and most refined type.\n\nThe process of beautifying and improving the city which is constantly\ngoing on bids fair to give us at no distant day a city of which we may\nwell be proud.\n\nBut let him who intends living well in Manila on a small income bid\nfarewell at once to so idylic a dream, for it costs much to live well\nthere. In the city of Manila one can get almost anything he wishes,\nbut it must be paid for at the price it commands. Especially in the\ncase of eatables, this price is by no means small, because to the\nfirst cost of articles must in most cases be added the expense of\ndistant shipment from American, European, or Australian ports, and not\ninfrequently the cost of long refrigeration must also be taken into\nconsideration. But, expensive though it is, it is very pleasant to\nlive there and those who have once enjoyed it often wish again to\nquaff the cup of its delights.\n\nIn strong contrast to this pleasant life is the life of the quiet\nlittle hamlet away in the distant islands. Indeed, the Filipino from\nthe distant town, who by some good fortune has been to Manila, or, by\na coup de main, has studied in one of the Manila colleges, is looked\nup to in a true hero-worshiping attitude by all who either know him or\nhear of his fame. Life in such a place is one long state of harmless\ninactivity. Not a wave of trouble from the great outer world ever\ndisturbs its peaceful repose. One lounges forever in an air of\nindolent ease and extreme aversion to anything approaching what might\nbe called a respectable effort.\n\nOne arises in the morning about the time the sun's first rays silver\nthe top leaves of the cocoanut trees and then stirs around until nine\nor ten o'clock, when it is found expedient to avoid a further exposure\nto the sun. From then until about five o'clock in the afternoon it is\nbest to take things as they come, even though one of those things be a\nFilipino dinner. But then you may have your vehiclo attached to a\nyoung bull with a ring in his nose and go for a drive. If it is the\ndry season you will probably enjoy the drive unless you object to the\nfrequent clouds of dust swept along by the evening wind. If it is in\nthe rainy season your pleasure will depend to a considerable extent\nupon how wet you get; but, whether the season be wet or dry, your\npleasure will be regulated largely by the state of harmony existing\nbetween the driver and the bull.\n\nIn these quiet secluded nooks successive generations of Filipinos are\nborn, reared, grow old and die in an even chain of events broken only\nby the occasional erection of a new grass house on the identical spot\nwhere its predecessors have stood for ages. The son lives in the house\nof his father, cultivates the same few square feet of soil planted in\nedible roots, climbs the same cocoanut trees, follows the same winding\npath down to the stream, pounds rice in the same mortar and with the\nsame stick that his ancestors have used from time unremembered, and,\nin case of illness, curls up on a grass mat in a corner of the room\nuntil he dies or by some good fortune recovers. Beyond this narrow\nhorizon he never looks. So narrow and contracted is the life that the\nlanguages of two towns a few miles apart are so different that one\nwould scarcely recognize them as belonging to the same race of people.\n\nSuch are the two extremes of life in our new far Eastern provinces:\nthe one is active, progressive, and cosmopolitan; the other, inactive,\ndecadent, and narrow; but, whether one enjoys the first or endures the\nsecond, there comes to him after leaving a longing to lounge again in\ntropic airs and listen to the lullaby of the winds among the palms.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VII. - THE FILIPINO AT HOME.\n\n\nAs one enters a Filipino sitting-room for the first time, there is one\nfeature in the arrangement of the furniture that impresses itself upon\nhim at once, and it may be stated without fear of serious\ncontradiction that this same peculiar feature in its arrangement will\ncontinue to face him, as he enters different homes, about as certainly\nas he crosses the threshold.\n\nThe arrangement referred to is that of one large mirror, one settee,\nand some ten or a dozen chairs that appear to have had a certain\norderly affection for one another. The mirror is hung upon one of the\nlarge interior parts of the house about four feet above the floor. The\nwooden houses in the Philippines are built by setting large posts\nupright into the ground, extending into the air from twenty to thirty\nfeet. Cross timbers are fastened to these upright posts about eight or\nten feet above the ground and then not sawed off even with the posts,\nbut allowed to extend beyond them each way. The framework of the house\nis built upon these extending cross timbers, a style of building by\nwhich these large upright posts are left standing out on the inside of\nthe room from one to three feet from the walls. It is on that one of\nthese posts most nearly opposite the door that the mirror always finds\nits place. Immediately beneath the mirror is the settee; and the\nchairs are arranged in two parallel lines facing one another and at\nright angles with the ends of the settee. However odd this arrangement\nmay appear to one when he first enters a Filipino drawing-room, there\nare two things to be said in its favor. In the first place, it places\nyou face to face with the person with whom you are conversing so that\nyou can watch him,--a matter of no small moment in the Philippines. In\nthe next place, it enables you to give one of the young ladies a\nsheep's-eye in the mirror while the others present are left where\nMoses was in our much abused conundrum.\n\nThe size of the residence and the quality of its furnishings depends\nupon the wealth of the owner. But there is so vast a difference\nbetween the mode of life of the highest class and the tao, or lowest\nclass, that it is well to speak of them separately, and the great\nmiddle class of Filipinos can easily be imagined to occupy the\nintervening ground.\n\nThe rich Filipino's house is usually of wood built upon a wall of\nstone or brick from ten to fifteen feet high. The floors are kept\nhighly polished in his hallway, dressing-room, and bed-rooms. There\nare, of course, no fire-places in any of the rooms, but on some\noccasions something is needed to dry the rain-soaked atmosphere, for\neven in the dry season it has been seen to rain for five successive\ndays and nights without the cessation of a moment.\n\nA long chain of dependents is attached to the household of the rich\nFilipino. The master has his special body servant to be present at all\ntimes to do his master's bidding, in short, to be the visible\nmechanism of his master's volition. So, too, the lady of the house has\nher servant woman to do the slightest bidding of her ladyship. Then\nthere is the cook who is almost invariably a man, a house boy or two,\nand the coachman. These functionaries, with their assistants and\nassistants to the assistants, together with a servant or two for the\nexclusive service of the children, complete the economic household.\n\nSuch a family has an abundance of rice and wheat bread, also of\nchicken and fish with occasional fresh beef. They have also a good\ndeal of dulce. They regularly serve wine and frequently serve beer\non their tables.\n\nIn strong contrast with this mode of life is that of the tao. His\ndiet consists almost wholly of rice and small uncleaned fish boiled\ntogether. As a rule knife, fork, plate, and spoon find no place in his\nhousehold. The rice and fish are boiled in a pot and then allowed to\ncool in the same vessel or poured out to cool in a large earthen or\nwooden bowl. Then Mr. Tao together with Mrs. Tao and all the young\nTaos squat on their heels around the mixture and satisfy that\nintangible thing called the appetite. They do not use chop sticks as\nthe Chinese do, but the rice and fish are caught in a hollow formed by\nthe first three fingers of the right hand. The thumb is then placed\nbehind the mass. It is raised up and poised before the mouth, with a\nskill coming from the evolution of ages, when a contraction of the\nmuscles of the thumb throws the mass into the mouth with a skill that\nis marvelous to any but a Filipino. To judge from the most reliable\ninformation, the poorest class do not have an abundance of food,\nalthough it would seem that such a condition of things would be\nwell-nigh impossible. However, in a census of one hundred school\nchildren there were found six boys and four girls who declared that\nthey had never had enough to eat, and the native teacher stated that\nthis was probably true.\n\nThe wide gulf between the tao and the rich man is filled by the\ngreat middle class of Filipinos.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VIII. - VISIT TO A LEPER COLONY.\n\n\nNot far from our town was a leper colony and the first Saturday that\ncould be spared was set aside for a trip to the place. It happened\nthat none of the other Americans were at leisure on this particular\nmorning, but, rather then delay the trip or miss it altogether, the\nwriter, armed with a revolver, started out alone.\n\nThe road had been described so accurately by one who was supposed to\nknow it that it was deemed well-nigh impossible to miss the way. The\nmain highway was followed to the point where the by-path supposed to\nlead to the settlement turned off through some bamboo thickets and a\nlow tropical wood. This path led straight away towards the sea-coast\nwhere the houses of the colony were said to stand in a cocoanut grove\nby the beach.\n\nUpon arriving at the settlement, a very inhospitable reception was\nreceived from a mangy cur that growled and showed a very uninviting\nset of sharp, white teeth behind his snarling lips. The growling of\nthe dog had attracted the attention of an old man who, with age-bent\nback, was pounding rice in a mortar about fifty yards away. He turned\nslowly around and, upon seeing an intruder into the primitive quiet of\nthe place, gave a sharp, far-reaching call. The sound had scarcely\nrung through the grove when from about a dozen of the little grass\nhouses dotted here and there fifteen or twenty men armed with bolos\ncame out and gathered around the old man. A sense of my danger flashed\nupon me. Three miles from town and alone in a tropical jungle, I could\nbe almost instantly overcome by this band of bolo-men, and the only\nreport that would ever reach my people would be that I had\n\"disappeared.\" Of course, attack was by no means certain, but the\npotentiality of the situation was thrilling. A drawn revolver and the\ngleaming of its shining barrel had the effect of stopping the men, who\nseemed to be hesitating as to a course of action, until a somewhat\ndignified retreat was made to an open space in the rear from where a\nless dignified and a more hasty retreat began which did not stop short\nof Bacalod.\n\nEnough had been seen, however, even in this short visit, to give\nconvincing proof that the settlement visited was no colony of lepers;\nso, that afternoon two servant boys being taken as guides and\ninterpreters, another attempt was made to reach the goal desired.\n\nThis attempt was successful, and, after about two hours of walking, a\nlittle cluster of grass huts snugly hidden by the sea-coast came into\nview. As we approached, one would have thought it a gala-day. Some few\nchildren, apparently from six to thirteen years of age, almost wholly\nnude, were romping and playing in the open space around which the huts\nstood, and no one would ever have thought that any cloud so horrible\nas leprosy could hover over a place apparently so happy.\n\nBy the side of the path as we passed was a man and his wife setting\nout potato plants. His hands were so puffed and his fingers so short\nthat he could scarcely use them, but he was working along as best he\ncould. His wife's feet were so swollen and twisted that she walked\nonly with the greatest difficulty. We passed them by and entered the\nopen space above referred to.\n\nThe children now saw us, and those of them who could darted away like\nfrightened rabbits, each to his own burrow. An old man who was sitting\nin the warm afternoon sun on the little bamboo platform before his hut\nwas aroused from his lethargic repose by the scampering away of the\nchildren. He arose, trembling upon his tottering limbs, all drawn and\ntwisted, and hobbled away into his hut.\n\nThe children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at\nthe doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of\nthe settlement. In a few moments we were surrounded by a circle of\nhuman beings at once so repulsive and so pitiable that its graphic\nvividness can never be accurately portrayed.\n\nThe old man referred to above, having put on a pair of snow-white\npantaloons, appeared now at the doorway of his hut, followed a few\nmoments later by his wife who had evidently clothed herself in the\nbest raiment she had. At a call from the old man, all the men, women,\nand children in the settlement came out of their huts and stood in a\nline before us. The old man was spokesman and in his native visayan\ntongue made a heart-rending appeal for aid which we were powerless to\ngive. Attention was called to a leper woman, apparently about\ntwenty-five years of age, whose face had been attacked by the disease\nand whose appearance was truly pathetic. Upon her hip was a child\nabout a year and a half old and, strange to say, the child showed as\nyet no signs whatever of the disease.\n\nWhat an indissoluble enigma is life! Here in a little cluster of grass\nhuts in a secluded nook of a secluded island of an all but secluded\narchipelago was gathered together a little community of wretched\nnatives, driven by their loathsomeness from association with others\neven of the same half-savage race. Yet here, men and women loved and\nwere married, by mutual trust if not by law, and children were born of\nthe union to live forever under the unspeakable horror that\novershadowed the unfortunate parents. Love, hatred, sorrow, and\njoy--every passion that enters into the complex structure of the human\nheart even here, in this scene of sadness and despair, was playing\napparently as freely as where misfortune and disease had never crossed\nthe portals of life.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER IX. - A \"HIKE.\"\n\n\nWe were lounging lazily in our hammocks at Jimamaylan one evening in\nApril. Supper was just ended, and the soldiers in the post were\ncollected in groups here and there spinning yarns to pass away the\ntime, when a Filipino clad only in a loin cloth came down the street\nat a steadily swinging run and stopped in front of the sentry. He\nbrought the announcement that a band of ladrones had just burned a\nsugar mill and were advancing to sack a barrio about fifteen miles\naway.\n\nThe invitation of the commanding officer to go on a \"hike\" was eagerly\naccepted, and, in ten minutes after the message was given, the troops\nwere on the march followed by two adventurous pedagogues.\n\nDarkness was just closing in as we left the town, but a resplendent\ntropic moon soon made the night almost as brilliant as the day. The\ntrail we followed led over rough and rocky country. Sometimes for a\ndistance of a mile or more we passed over barren wastes of volcanic\nslag poured out in anger by some peak whose convulsions have long\nsince ceased. Again we would descend into a tropical jungle from the\ndense foliage of which the ladrones could have leaped at any moment,\nhad they known of our coming, and annihilated our little band. We\nforded rapid streams with the water at our breasts, and halted only\nonce in that rapid march of fifteen miles.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the town we met a man who was standing\nguard against a surprise by the ladrones. Nothing could well have been\nmuch more grotesque and nothing could much better illustrate the\nabsolutely primitive condition of the Filipinos in the interior of the\nislands than the appearance of this guard. A pair of knee pants, a\nconical grass hat, and a hemp shirt formed his entire apparel. A long\nflat wooden shield, a bolo, and a long bamboo spear with a sharp,\nflat, iron point, completed his equipment for battle.\n\nHere stood the first and the twentieth centuries side by side. The\nFilipino who had advanced only a stage beyond the condition of\nprimitive man with his knife, spear, and wooden shield, stood side by\nside with the American soldier, a representative of modern life with\nhis magazine rifle, his canteen, his knapsack,--with every article of\nhis clothing made to give him the highest possible efficiency as the\nunit of a military organization.\n\nA few yards farther on we met another guard equipped similarly to the\nfirst. Upon reaching the town, news had just been received that a\ndetachment of troops from another post had intercepted the ladrones\nand fought a skirmish with them. The ladrones had escaped and we set\nout in pursuit of them on a chase wilder than a Quixotic dream. We\nwound our way into the mountains behind the town, inquiring at every\ngrass hut we passed whether the band of ladrones had passed that way,\nbut only once was even a trace of them found. Then it was learned that\nat a certain place they had separated into groups of three or four and\ngone glimmering through the dream of things that were. This place was\nin a secluded nook of the mountains where in years gone by some\nadventurous Spaniard had erected a primitive water mill to grind his\nsugar-cane. We had now marched about twenty miles and the feet of the\npedagogues were a mass of blisters. They had reached the point where\nthat form of military maneuvering called \"hiking\" ceased to possess\nany alluring charms. So a native was persuaded to come out of his lone\nmountain hut and hitch up his carabao and cart. He was then made to\nget on the carabao's back, while the aforesaid pedagogues lay down on\nthe sugar-cane pulp that had been put into the body of the cart, and\nthe driver was instructed to start for the post we had left hours\nbefore, and not to stop until he got there. Being uncertain but that\nsome of the ladrones would learn of our having left the body of troops\nand would try the metal of our steel, we at first agreed that neither\nof us should go to sleep, but it was later decided that probably the\ndriver had no greater desire to cross the Styx than his passengers had\nand that in case of danger he would awaken us, so both took a revolver\nin each hand, stretched out supinely and went to sleep.\n\nSuch a sleep! The rough jolting of the cart over an almost impassable\nroad was never enough to break the spell of slumber. When we awoke the\nblazing tropic sun was past the midday mark of morning, shining full\ninto our unprotected and well-nigh blistered faces.\n\nA pack of dogs were heralding our approach to a little village at the\nfoot of the mountains where ponies were procured to take us back to\nthe post.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he insists, \"have stood the test of ages; and the plant\nevery where retained its name and credit: and one of our good\nherbarists, who had seen a wonderful case of a swoln spleen, so big, and\nhard as to be felt with terror, brought back to a state of nature by it\"\n\n(p. 37). The greatest portion of Hill's concluding section combines\nadvertisement for the powder medicine he was himself manufacturing at a\nhandsome profit together with a protest against competing apothecaries:\n\"An intelligent person was directed to go to the medicinal herb shops in\nthe several markets, and buy some of this Spleen-wort; the name was\nwritten, and shewn to every one; every shop received his money, and\nalmost every one sold a different plant, under the name of this: but\nwhat is very striking, not one of them the right\" (p. 42).\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis did not cease to be printed after Hill's in\n1766, but continued to issue from the presses into the nineteenth\ncentury. A good example of this is the tome by John Reid, physician to\nthe Finsbury Dispensary in London, Essays on Insanity, Hypochondriasis\nand Other Nervous Affections (1816), which summarizes theories of the\nmalady. A bibliographical study of such works would probably reveal\na larger number of titles in the nineteenth century than in the previous\none, but by this time the nature and definition of hypochondria had\nchanged significantly.\n\nIf John Hill's volume is not an important contribution in the history of\nmedicine, it is a lucid and brief exposition of many of the best ideas\nthat had been thought and written on the hyp, with the exception of his\nuninhibited prescribing of herbal medicines as cure-alls. An\nunderstanding of this disease is essential for readers of neoclassical\nEnglish literature, especially when we reflect upon the fact that some\nof the best literature of the period was composed by writers whom it\nafflicted. It is perhaps not without significance that the greatest poet\nof the Augustan age, Alexander Pope, thought it necessary as he lay on\nhis deathbed in May 1744 to exclaim with his last breath, \"I never was\nhippish in my whole life.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. I. - The NATURE of the DISORDER.\n\n\nTo call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and cruel. It\nis a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by thickened\nand distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver, and other\nparts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick scarce knows\none more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\n\nThe blood is a mixture of many fluids, which, in a state of health, are\nso combined, that the whole passes freely through its appointed vessels;\nbut if by the loss of the thinner parts, the rest becomes too gross to\nbe thus carried through, it will stop where the circulation has least\npower; and having thus stopped it will accumulate; heaping by degrees\nobstruction on obstruction.\n\nHealth and chearfulness, and the quiet exercise of mind, depend upon a\nperfect circulation: is it a wonder then, when this becomes impeded the\nbody looses of its health, and the temper of its sprightliness? to be\notherwise would be the miracle; and he inhumanly insults the afflicted,\nwho calls all this a voluntary frowardness. Its slightest state brings\nwith it sickness, anguish and oppression; and innumerable ills follow\nits advancing steps, unless prevented by timely care; till life itself\ngrows burthensome.\n\nThe disease was common in antient Greece; and her physicians understood\nit, better than those perhaps of later times, in any other country; who\nthough happy in many advantages these fathers of the science could not\nhave, yet want the great assistance of frequent watching it in all its\nstages.\n\nThose venerable writers have delivered its nature, and its cure: in the\nfirst every thing now shews they were right; and what they have said as\nto the latter will be found equally true and certain. This, so far as\npresent experience has confirmed it, and no farther, will be here laid\nbefore the afflicted in a few plain words.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. II. - Persons Subject to it.\n\n\nFatigue of mind, and great exertion of its powers often give birth to\nthis disease; and always tend to encrease it. The finer spirits are\nwasted by the labour of the brain: the Philosopher rises from his study\nmore exhausted than the Peasant leaves his drudgery; without the benefit\nthat he has from exercise. Greatness of mind, and steady virtue;\ndetermined resolution, and manly firmness, when put in action, and\nintent upon their object, all also lead to it: perhaps whatever tends to\nthe ennobling of the soul has equal share in bringing on this weakness\nof the body.\n\nFrom this we may learn easily who are the men most subject to it; the\ngrave and studious, those of a sedate temper and enlarged understanding,\nthe learned and wise, the virtuous and the valiant: those whom it were\nthe interest of the world to wish were free from this and every other\nillness; and who perhaps, except for this alloy, would have too large a\nportion of human happiness.\n\nThough these are most, it is not these alone, who are subject to it.\n\nThere are countries where it is endemial, and in other places some have\nthe seeds of it in their constitution; and in some it takes rise from\naccidents. In these last it is the easiest of cure; and in the first\nmost difficult.\n\nBeside the Greeks already named, the Jews of old time were heavily\nafflicted with this disease; and in their descendants to this day it is\noften constitutional: the Spaniards have it almost to a man; and so have\nthe American Indians. Perhaps the character of these several nations may\nbe connected with it. The steady honour, and firm valour of the\nSpaniard, very like that of the ancient Doric nation, who followed the\nflute not the trumpet to the field; and met the enemy, not with shouts\nand fury, but with a determined virtue: it is the temper of the\nHypochondriac to be slow, but unmoveably resolved: the Jew has shewn\nthis mistakenly, but almost miraculously; and the poor Indian, untaught\nas he is, faces all peril with composure, and sings his death-song with\nan unalter'd countenance.\n\nAmong particular persons the most inquiring and contemplative are those\nwho suffer oftenest by this disease; and of all degrees of men I think\nthe clergy. I do not mean the hunting, shooting, drinking clergy, who\nbear the tables of the great; but the retir'd and conscientious; such as\nattend in midnight silence to their duty; and seek in their own cool\nbreasts, or wheresoever else they may be found, new admonitions for an\nage plunged in new vices. To this disease we owe the irreparable loss of\nDr. YOUNG; and the present danger of many other the best and most\nimproved amongst us. May what is here to be proposed assist in their\npreservation!\n\nThe Geometrician or the learned Philosopher of whatever denomination,\nwhose course of study fixes his eye for ever on one object, his mind\nintensely and continually employed upon one thought, should be warned\nalso that he is in danger; or if he find himself already afflicted, he\nshould be told that the same course of life, which brought it on, will,\nwithout due care, encrease it to the most dreaded violence.\n\nThe middle period of life is that in which there is the greatest danger\nof an attack from this disease; and the latter end of autumn, when the\nsummer heats have a little time been over, is the season when in our\nclimate its first assaults are most to be expected. The same time of the\nyear always increases the disorder in those who have been before\nafflicted with it; and it is a truth must be confessed, that from its\nfirst attack the patient grows continually, though slowly, worse; unless\na careful regimen prevent it.\n\nThe constitutions most liable to this obstruction are the lean, and dark\ncomplexioned; the grave and sedentary. Let such watch the first\nsymptoms; and obviate, (as they may with ease) that which it will be\nmuch more difficult to remove.\n\nIt is happy a disease, wherein the patient must do a great deal for\nhimself, falls, for the most part, upon those who have the powers of\nreason strongest. Let them only be aware of this, that the distemper\nnaturally disposes them to inactivity; and reason will have no use\nunless accompanied with resolution to enforce it.\n\nThough the physician can do something toward the cure, much more depends\nupon the patient; and here his constancy of mind will be employed most\nhappily. No one is better qualified to judge on a fair hearing what\ncourse is the most fit; and having made that choice, he must with\npatience wait its good effects. Diseases that come on slowly must have\ntime for curing; an attention to the first appearances of the disorder\nwill be always happiest; because when least established it is easiest\noverthrown: but when that happy period has been neglected, he must wait\nthe effects of such a course as will dilute and melt the obstructing\nmatter gradually; for till that be done it is not only vain, but\nsometimes dangerous, to attempt its expulsion from the body.\n\nThe blood easily separates itself into the grosser and the thinner\nparts: we see this in bleeding; and from the toughness of the red cake\nmay guess how very difficult it will be to dissolve a substance of like\nfirmness in the vessels of the body. That it can thus become thickened\nwithin the body, a Pleurisy shews us too evidently: in that case it is\nbrought on suddenly, and with inflammation; in this other, slowly and\nwithout; and here, even before it forms the obstruction, can bring on\nmany mischiefs. Various causes can produce the same effect, but that in\nall cases operates most durably, which operates most slowly. The watery\npart of the blood is its mild part; in the remaining gross matter of it,\nare acrid salts and burning oils, and these, when destitute of that\nhappy dilution nature gives them in a healthy body, are capable of doing\ngreat mischief to the tender vessels in which they are kept stagnant.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. III. - The SYMPTOMS of the DISORDER.\n\n\nThe first and lightest of the signs that shew this illness are a lowness\nof spirits, and inaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love\nof solitude and a habit of thinking, even on trifling subjects, with too\nmuch steadiness. A very little help may combat these: but if that\nindolence which is indeed a part of the disorder, will neglect them;\nworse must be expected soon to follow.\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness, weight, and oppression in the body,\na want of appetite, or, what is worse, an appetite without digestion;\nfor these are the conditions of different states of the disease, a\nfullness and a difficulty of breathing after meals, a straitness of the\nbreast, pains and flatulencies in the bowels, and an unaptness to\ndischarge their contents.\n\nThe pulse becomes low, weak, and unequal; and there are frequent\npalpitations of the heart, a little dark-coloured urine is voided at\nsome times; and a flood of colourless and insipid at others; relieving\nfor a moment, but increasing the distemper: there is in some cases also\na continual teazing cough, with a choaking stoppage in the throat at\ntimes; then heartburn, sickness, hardness of the belly, and a costive\nhabit, or a tormenting and vain irritation.\n\nThe lips turn pale, the eyes loose their brightness and by degrees the\nwhite grows as it were greenish, the gums want their due firmness, with\ntheir proper colour; and an unpleasing foulness grows upon the teeth:\nthe inside of the mouth is pale and furred, and the throat dry and\nhusky: the colour of the skin is pale (though there are periods when the\nface is florid) and as the obstruction gathers ground, and more affects\nthe liver, the whole body becomes yellow, tawny, greenish, and at length\nof that deep and dusky hue, to which men of swift imagination have given\nthe name of blackness.\n\nThese symptoms do not all appear in any one period of the disease, or in\none case, but at one time or other all of them, as well as those which\nfollow: the flesh becomes cold to the touch, though the patient does not\nhimself perceive it; the limbs grow numbed and torpid, the breathing\ndull and slow, and the voice hollow; and usually the appetite in this\nperiod declines, and comes almost to nothing: night sweats come on,\nblack swellings appear on the veins, the flesh wastes and the breast\nbecomes flat and hollow: the mouth is full of a thin spittle, the head\nis dizzy and confus'd, and sometimes there is an unconquerable numbness\nin the organs of speech.\n\nI have known the temporary silence that follows upon this last symptom\nbecome a jest to the common herd; and the unhappy patient, instead of\ncompassion and assistance, receive the reproof of sullenness, from those\nwho should have known and acted better.\n\nAbout twenty years ago I met on a visit at Catthorpe in Leicestershire a\nyoung gentleman of distinguished learning and abilities, who at certain\ntimes was speechless. The vulgar thought it a pretence: and a jocose\nlady, where he was at tea with company, putting him as she said to a\ntrial, poured out a dish very strong and without sugar. He drank it and\nreturned the cup with a bow of great reserve, and his eye bent on the\nground: she then filled the cup with sugar, and pouring weak tea on it,\nsent it him: he drank that too, looked at her steadily, and blushed for\nher. The lady declared the man was dumb; the rest thought him perverse,\nand obstinate; but a constant and steady perseverance in an easy method\ncured him.\n\nAll these are miseries which the disease, while it retains its natural\nform, can bring upon the patient; and thus he will in time be worn out,\nand led miserably, though slowly, to the grave. Let him not indulge his\ninactivity so far as to give way to this, because it is represented as\nfar off; the disease may suddenly and frightfully change its nature; and\nswifter evils follow.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. IV. - The DANGER.\n\n\nWe have done with the obstruction considered in itself; but this, though\noften unsurmountable by art, at least by the methods now in use, will be\nsometimes broken through at once by nature, or by accidents; and bring\non fatal evils. These are strictly different diseases, and are no\notherway concerned here, than as the consequences of that of which we\nare treating.\n\nThe thick and glutinous blood which has so long stagnated in the spleen,\nwill have in that time altered its nature, and acquired a very great\ndegree of acrimony: while it lies dormant, this does no more mischiefs,\nthan those named already; but when violent exercise, a fit of outrageous\nanger, or any thing else that suddenly shocks and disturbs the frame,\nputs it in motion, it melts at once into a kind of liquid putrefaction.\n\nBeing now thin, it mixes itself readily with the blood again, and brings\non putrid fevers; destroys the substance of the spleen itself, or being\nthrown upon some other of the viscera, corrodes them, and leads on this\nway a swift and miserable death. If it fall upon the liver, its tender\npulpy substance is soon destroyed, jaundices beyond the help of art\nfirst follow, then dropsies and all their train of misery; if on lungs,\nconsumptions; if on the brain, convulsions, epilepsy, palsy, apoplexy;\nif on the surface, leprosy.\n\nThe intention of cure is to melt this coagulation softly, not to break\nit violently; and then to give it a very gentle passage through the\nbowels. There is no safe way for it to take but that; and even that when\nurged too far may bring on fatal dysenteries.\n\nLet none wonder at the sudden devastation which sometimes arises from\nthis long stagnant matter, when liquified too hastily: how long, how\nmany years the impacted matter will continue quiet in a schirrous tumour\nof the breast; but being once put in motion, whether from accident, or\nin the course of nature, what can describe; or what can stop its\nhavock!\n\nInstances of the other are too frequent. A nobleman the other day died\nparalytick: dissection shewed a spleen consumed by an abscess, formed\nfrom the dissolved matter of such an obstruction: and 'tis scarce longer\nsince, a learned gentleman, who had been several years lost to his\nfriends, by the extreams of a Hypochondriacal disorder, seem'd gradually\nwithout assistance to recover: but the lungs suffered while the spleen\nwas freed; and he died very soon of what is called a galloping\nconsumption.\n\nWhen the obstruction is great and of long continuance, if it be thus\nhastily moved, the consequence is, equally, a sudden and a miserable\ndeath, whether, like the matter of a cancer, it remains in its place; or\nlike that of a bad small pox, be thrown upon some other vital part.\n\nLet not the patient be too much alarmed; this is laid down to caution,\nnot to terrify him: it is fit he should know his danger, and attend to\nit; for the prevention is easy; and the cure, even of the most advanced\nstages, when undertaken by gentle means, is not at all impracticable: to\nassist the physician, let him look into himself, and recollect the\nsource of his complaint. This he may judge of from the following\nnotices.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. V. - The Causes of the HYPOCHONDRIASIS.\n\n\nThe obstruction which forms this disease, may take its origin from\ndifferent accidents: a fever ill cured has often caused it; or the\npiles, which had been used to discharge largely, ceasing; a marshy soil,\npoisoned with stagnant water, has given it to some persons; and altho'\nindolence and inactivity are oftenest at the root, yet it has arisen\nfrom too great exercise.\n\nReal grief has often brought it on; and even love, for sometimes that is\nreal. Study and fixed attention of the mind have been accused before;\nand add to these the stooping posture of the body, which most men use,\nthough none should use it, in writing and in reading. This has\ncontributed too much to it; but of all other things night studies are\nthe most destructive. The steady stillness, and dusky habit of all\nnature in those hours, enforce, encourage, and support that settled\ngloom, which rises from fixt thought; and sinks the body to the grave;\neven while it carries up the mind to heaven. He who would have his lamp\n        At midnight hour\n  Be seen in some high lonely tower,\nwill waste the flame of this unheeded life: and while he labours to\nunsphere the spirit of Plato will let loose his own.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VI. - The Cure of the HYPOCHONDRIASIS.\n\n\nLet him who would escape the mischiefs of an obstructed spleen, avoid\nthe things here named: and let him who suffers from the malady,\nendeavour to remember to which of them it has been owing; for half the\nhope depends upon that knowledge.\n\nNature has sometimes made a cure herself, and we should watch her ways;\nfor art never is so right as when it imitates her: sometimes the\npatient's own resolution has set him free. This is always in his power,\nand at all times will do wonders.\n\nThe bleeding of the piles, from nature's single efforts, has at once\ncured a miserable man; where their cessation was the cause of the\ndisorder. A leprosy has appeared upon the skin, and all the symptoms of\nthe former sickness vanished. This among the Jews happened often: both\ndiseases we know were common among them: and I have here seen something\nvery like it: Water-Dock has thrown out scorbutic eruptions, and all the\nformer symptoms of an Hypochondriacal disorder have disappeared:\nreturning indeed when these were unadvisedly struck in; but keeping off\nentirely when they were better treated. A natural purging unsuppressed\nhas sometimes done the same good office: but this is hazardous.\n\nIt is easy to be directed from such instances; only let us take the\nwhole along with us. Bleeding would have answered nature's purpose, if\nshe could not have opened of herself the h\u00e6morrhoidal vessels; but he\nwho should give medicines for that purpose, might destroy his patient by\ntoo great disturbance. If a natural looseness may perform the cure, so\nmay an artificial; when the original source of the disorder points that\nway. But these are helps that take place only in particular cases.\n\nThe general and universal method of cure must be by some mild and gently\nresolving medicine, under the influence of which the obstructing matter\nmay be voided that, or some other way with safety. The best season to\nundertake this is the autumn, but even here there must be caution.\n\nIn the first place, no strong evacuating remedy must be given; for that,\nby carrying off the thinner parts of the juices, will tend to thicken\nthe remainder; and certainly encrease the distemper. No acrid medicine\nmust be directed, for that may act too hastily, dissolve the impacted\nmatter at once, and let it loose, to the destruction of the sufferer; no\nantimonial, no mercurial, no martial preparation must be taken; in\nshort, no chymistry: nature is the shop that heaven has set before us,\nand we must seek our medicine there. The venerable ancients, who knew\nnot this new art, will lead us in the search; and (faithful relators as\nthey are of truth) will tell us whence we may deduce our hope; and what\nwe are to fear.\n\nBut prior to the course of any medicine, and as an essential to any good\nhope from it, the patient must prescribe himself a proper course of\nlife, and a well chosen diet: let us assist him in his choice; and speak\nof this first, as it comes first in order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VI. - Rules of Life for Hypochondriac Persons.\n\n\nAir and exercise, as they are the best preservers of health, and\ngreatest assistants in the cure of all long continued diseases, will\nhave their full effect in this; but there requires some caution in the\nchoice, and management of them. It is common to think the air of high\ngrounds best; but experience near home shews otherwise: the\nHypochondriac patient is always worse at Highgate even than in London.\n\nThe air he breathes should be temperate; not exposed to the utmost\nviolences of heat and cold, and the swift changes from one to the\nother; which are most felt on those high grounds. The side of a hill is\nthe best place for him: and though wet grounds are hurtful; yet let\nthere be the shade of trees, to tempt him often to a walk; and soften by\ntheir exhalation the over dryness of the air.\n\nThe exercise he takes should be frequent; but not violent. Motion\npreserves the firmness of the parts, and elasticity of the vessels; it\nprevents that aggregation of thick humours which he is most to fear. A\nsedentary life always produces weakness, and that mischief always\nfollows: weak eyes are gummy, weak lungs are clogged with phlegm, and\nweak bowels waste themselves in vapid diarrhoeas.\n\nLet him invite himself abroad, and let his friends invite him by every\ninnocent inducement. For me, I should advise above all other things the\nstudy of nature. Let him begin with plants: he will here find a\ncontinual pleasure, and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful\nthings; even of the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to\nwalk; and every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket,\nwill afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually\nin the air, and continually to change the nature and quality of the air,\nby visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the lawn, the\nheath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be abroad; and the\nunceasing variety of the subjects of his observation, will prevent his\nwalking hastily: he will pursue his studies in the air; and that\ncontemplative turn of mind, which in his closet threatened his\ndestruction, will thus become the great means of his recovery.\n\nIf the mind tire upon this, from the repeated use, another of nature's\nkingdoms opens itself at once upon him; the plant he is weary of\nobserving, feeds some insect he may examine; nor is there a stone that\nlies before his foot, but may afford instruction and amusement.\n\nEven what the vulgar call the most abject things will shew a wonderful\nutility; and lead the mind, in pious contemplation higher than the\nstars. The poorest moss that is trampled under foot, has its important\nuses: is it at the bottom of a wood we find it? why there it shelters\nthe fallen seeds; hides them from birds, and covers them from frost;\nand thus becomes the foster father of another forest! creeps it along\nthe surface of a rock? even there its good is infinite! its small roots\nrun into the stone, and the rains make their way after them; the moss\nhaving lived its time dies; it rots and with the mouldered fragments of\nthe stone forms earth; wherein, after a few successions, useful plants\nmay grow, and feed more useful cattle!\n\nIs there a weed more humble in its aspect, more trampled on, or more\ndespised than knot grass! no art can get the better of its growth, no\nlabour can destroy it; 'twere pity if they could, for the thing lives\nwhere nothing would of use to us; and its large and most wonderfully\nabundant seeds, feed in hard winters, half the birds of Heaven.\n\nWhat the weak moss performs upon the rock the loathed toadstool brings\nabout in timber: is an oak dead where man's eye will not find it? this\nfungus roots itself upon the bark, and rots the wood beneath it; hither\nthe beetle creeps for shelter, and for sustenance; him the woodpecker\nfollows as his prey; and while he tears the tree in search of him, he\nscatters it about the ground; which it manures.\n\nNor is it the beetle alone that thus insinuates itself into the\nsubstance of the vegetable tribe: the tender aphide, whom a touch\ndestroys, burrows between the two skins of a leaf, for shelter from his\nwinged enemies; tracing, with more than Dedal\u00e6an art, his various\nmeanders; and veining the green surface with these white lines more\nbeautifully than the best \u00c6gyptian marble.\n\n'Twere endless to proceed; nor is it needful: one object will not fail\nto lead on to another, and every where the goodness of his God will\nshine before him even in what are thought the vilest things; his\ngreatness in the lead of them.\n\nLet him pursue these thoughts, and seek abroad the objects and the\ninstigations to them: but let him in these and all other excursions\navoid equally the dews of early morning, and of evening.\n\nThe more than usual exercise of this prescription will dispose him to\nmore than customary sleep, let him indulge it freely; so far from\nhurting, it will help his cure.\n\nLet him avoid all excesses: drink need scarce be named, for we are\nwriting to men of better and of nobler minds, than can be tempted to\nthat humiliating vice. Those who in this disorder have too great an\nappetite, must not indulge it; much eaten was never well digested: but\nof all excesses the most fatal in this case is that of venery. It is the\nexcess we speak of.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VII. - The proper DIET.\n\n\nIn the first place acids must be avoided carefully; and all things that\nare in a state of fermentation, for they will breed acidity. Provisions\nhardened by salting never should be tasted; much less those cured by\nsmoaking, and by salting. Bacon is indigestible in an Hypochondriac\nstomach; and hams, impregnated as is now the custom, with acid fumes\nfrom the wood fires over which they are hung, have that additional\nmischief.\n\nMilk ought to be a great article in the diet: and even in this there\nshould be choice. The milk of grass-fed cows has its true quality: no\nother. There are a multitude of ways in which this may be made a part\nboth of our foods and drinks, and they should all be used.\n\nThe great and general caution is that the diet be at all times of a kind\nloosening and gently stimulating; light but not acrid. Veal, lamb,\nfowls, lobsters, crabs, craw-fish, fresh water fish and mutton broth,\nwith plenty of boiled vegetables, are always right; and give enough\nvariety.\n\nRaw vegetables are all bad: sour wines, old cheese, and bottled beer are\nthings never to be once tasted. Indeed much wine is wrong, be it of what\nkind soever. It is the first of cordials; and as such I would have it\ntaken in this disease when it is wanted: plainly as a medicine, rather\nthan a part of diet. Malt liquor carefully chosen is certainly the best\ndrink. This must be neither new, nor tending to sourness; perfectly\nclear, and of a moderate strength: it is the native liquor of our\ncountry, and the most healthful.\n\nToo much tea weakens; and even sugar is in this disorder hurtful: but\nhoney may supply its place in most things; and this is not only harmless\nbut medicinal; a very powerful dissolvent of impacted humours, and a\ngreat deobstruent.\n\nWhat wine is drank should be of some of the sweet kinds. Old Hock has\nbeen found on enquiry to yield more than ten times the acid of the sweet\nwines; and in red Port, at least in what we are content to call so,\nthere is an astringent quality, that is most mischievous in these cases:\nit is said there is often alum in it: how pregnant with mischief that\nmust be to persons whose bowels require to be kept open, is most\nevident. Summer fruits perfectly ripe are not only harmless but\nmedicinal; but if eaten unripe they will be very prejudicial. A light\nsupper, which will leave an appetite for a milk breakfast, is always\nright; this will not let the stomach be ravenous for dinner, as it is\napt to be in those who make that their only meal.\n\nOne caution more must be given, and it may seem a strange one: it is\nthat the patient attend regularly to his hours of eating. We have to do\nwith men for the most part whose soul is the great object of their\nregard; but let them not forget they have a body.\n\nThe late Dr. STUKELY has told me, that one day by appointment visiting\nSir ISAAC NEWTON, the servant told him, he was in his study. No one was\npermitted to disturb him there; but as it was near dinner time, the\nvisitor sat down to wait for him. After a time dinner was brought in; a\nboil'd chicken under a cover. An hour pass'd, and Sir ISAAC did not\nappear. The doctor eat the fowl, and covering up the empty dish, bad\nthem dress their master another. Before that was ready, the great man\ncame down; he apologiz'd for his delay, and added, \"give me but leave to\ntake my short dinner, and I shall be at your service; I am fatigued and\nfaint.\" Saying this, he lifted up the cover; and without any emotion,\nturned about to STUKELY with a smile; \"See says he, what we studious\npeople are, I forgot I had din'd.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VIII. - The MEDICINE.\n\n\n'Tis the ill fate of this disease, more than of all others to be\nmisunderstood at first, and thence neglected; till the physician shakes\nhis head at a few first questions. None steals so fatally upon the\nsufferer: its advances are by very slow degrees; but every day it grows\nmore difficult of cure.\n\nThat this obstruction in the spleen is the true malady, the cases\nrelated by the antients, present observation, and the unerring\ntestimonies of dissections leave no room to doubt. Being understood, the\npath is open where to seek a remedy: and our best guides in this, as in\nthe former instance, will be those venerable Greeks; who saw a thousand\nof these cases, where we see one; and with less than half our theory,\ncured twice as many patients.\n\nOne established doctrine holds place in all these writers; that whatever\nby a hasty fermentation dissolves the impacted matter of the\nobstruction, and sends it in that state into the blood, does incredible\nmischief: but that whatever medicine softens it by slow degrees, and, as\nit melts, delivers it to the bowels without disturbance; will cure with\nequal certainty and safety.\n\nFor this good purpose, they knew and tried a multitude of herbs; but in\nthe end they fixed on one: and on their repeated trials of this, they\nbanished all the rest. This stood alone for the cure of the disease; and\nfrom its virtue received the name of SPLEEN-WORT. O wise and happy\nGreeks! authors of knowledge and perpetuators of it! With them the very\nname they gave a plant declared its virtues: with us, a writer calls a\nplant from some friend; that the good gardener who receives the honour,\nmay call another by his name who gave it. We now add the term smooth\nto this herb, to distinguish it from another, called by the same general\nterm, though not much resembling it.\n\nThe virtues of this smooth Spleen-wort have flood the test of ages; and\nthe plant every where retained its name and credit: and one of our good\nherbalists, who had seen a wonderful case of a swoln spleen, so big, and\nhard as to be felt with terror, brought back to a state of nature by it;\nand all the miserable symptoms vanish; thought Spleen-wort not enough\nexpressive of its excellence; but stamp'd on it the name of MILT-WASTE.\n\nIn the Greek Islands now, the use of it is known to every one; and even\nthe lazy monks who take it, are no longer splenetic. In the west of\nEngland, the rocks are stripped of it with diligence; and every old woman\ntells you how charming that leaf is for bookish men: in Russia they use\na plant of this kind in their malt liquor: it came into fashion there\nfor the cure of this disease; which from its constant use is scarce\nknown any longer; and they suppose 'tis added to their liquor for a\nflavour.\n\nThe ancients held it in a kind of veneration; and used what has been\ncalled a superstition in the gathering it. It was to be taken up with a\nsharp knife, without violence, and laid upon the clean linen: no time\nbut the still darkness of the night was proper, and even the moon was\nnot to shine upon it. I know they have been ridiculed for this; for\nnothing is so vain as learned ignorance: but let me be permitted once to\nvindicate them.\n\nThe plant has leaves that can close in their sides; and their under part\nis covered thick with a yellow powder, consisting of the seeds, and seed\nvessels: in these they knew the virtue most resided: this was the golden\ndust they held so valuable; and this they knew they could not be too\ncautious to preserve. They were not ignorant of the sleep of plants; a\nmatter lately spoken of by some, as if a new discovery; and being\nsensible that light, a dry air, an expanded leaf, and a tempestuous\nseason, were the means of losing this fine dust; and knowing also that\ndarkness alone brought on that closing of the leaf which thence has\nbeen called sleep; and which helped to defend and to secure it, they\ntherefore took such time, and used such means as could best preserve the\nplant entire; and even save what might be scattered from it.--And now\nwhere is their superstition?\n\nFrom this plant thus collected they prepared a medicine, which in a\ncourse of forty days scarce ever failed to make a perfect cure.\n\nWe have the plant wild with us; and till the fashion of rough chemical\npreparations took off our attention from these gentler remedies, it was\nin frequent use and great repute. I trust it will be so again: and many\nthank me for restoring it to notice.\n\nSpleen-wort gives out its virtues freely in a tincture; and a small dose\nof this, mixing readily with the blood and juices, gradually dissolves\nthe obstruction; and by a little at a time delivers its contents to be\nthrown off without pain, from the bowels. Let this be done while the\nviscera are yet sound and the cure is perfect. More than the forty days\nof the Greek method is scarce ever required; much oftener two thirds of\nthat time suffice; and every day, from the first dose of it, the patient\nfeels the happy change that is growing in his constitution. His food no\nmore turns putrid on his stomach, but yields its healthful nourishment.\n\nThe swelling after meals therefore vanishes; and with that goes the\nlowness, and anxiety, the difficult breath, and the distracting cholick:\nhe can bear the approach of rainy weather without pain; he finds himself\nmore apt for motion, and ready to take that exercise which is to be\nassistant in his cure; life seems no longer burthensome. His bowels get\ninto the natural condition of health, and perform their office once at\nleast a day; better if a little more: the dull and dead colour of his\nskin goes off, his lips grow red again, and every sign of health\nreturns.\n\nLet him who takes the medicine, say whether any thing here be\nexaggerated. Let him, if he pleases to give himself the trouble, talk\nover with me, or write to me, this gradual decrease of his complaints,\nas he proceeds in his cure. My uncertain state of health does not\npermit me to practise physic in the usual way, but I am very desirous to\ndo what good I can, and shall never refuse my advice, such as it may be,\nto any person rich or poor, in whatever manner he may apply for it. I\nshall refer him to no apothecary, whose bills require he should be\ndrenched with potions; but tell him, in this as in all other cases,\nwhere to find some simple herb; which he may if he please prepare\nhimself; or if he had rather spare that trouble, may have it so prepared\nfrom me.\n\nWith regard to Spleen-wort, no method of using it is more effectual than\nsimply taking it in powder; the only advantage of a tincture, is that a\nproper dose may be given, and yet the stomach not be loaded with so\nlarge a quantity: it is an easier and pleasanter method, and nothing\nmore.\n\nIf any person choose to take it in the other way, I should still wish\nhim once at least to apply to me; that he may be assured what he is\nabout to take is the right plant. Abuses in medicines are at this time\nvery great, and in no instance worse than what relates to herbs. The\nbest of our physicians have complained upon this head with warmth, but\nwithout redress: they know the virtues and the value of many of our\nnative plants, but dread to prescribe them; lest some wrong thing should\nbe administered in their place; perhaps inefficacious, perhaps\nmischievous, nay it may be fatal. The few simple things I direct are\nalways before me; and it will at all times be a pleasure to me, in this\nand any other instance, to see whether what any person is about to take\nbe right. I have great obligations to the public, and this is the best\nreturn that I know how to make.\n\nTo see the need of such a caution, hear a transaction but of yesterday!\n\nAn intelligent person was directed to go to the medicinal herb shops in\nthe several markets, and buy some of this Spleen-wort; the name was\nwritten, and shewn to every one; every shop received his money, and\nalmost every one sold a different plant, under the name of this: but\nwhat is very striking, not one of them the right. Such is the chance of\nhealth in those hands through which the best means of it usually pass;\neven in the most regular course of application.\n\nI would not be understood to limit the little services I may this way be\nable to render the afflicted, to this single instance; much less to\npropose to myself any advantages from it. Whoever pleases will be\nwelcome to me, upon any such occasion; and whatever be the herb on which\nhe places a dependance, he shall be shewn it growing. I once recommended\na garden to be established for this use, at the public expence: one\ngreat person has put it in my power to answer all its purposes.\n\n                        F  I  N  I  S.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris, he was\n\"nominated\" to the Academy. He had but to present an Historical\nPainting in order to take his seat as an Academician.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VENUS AND MARRIAGE\n\n\nBack in his beloved Paris again; thrilled by the atmosphere and gaiety\nof its merry life; in the full vigour of manhood on the eve of his\nthirties; amongst congenial friends; done with the drudgery of winning\nto Academic honour, Boucher saw that the public were not falling over\neach other to purchase religious or historic pictures; he straightway\nturned his back upon these things, and on the edge of his thirtieth\nyear he gave to the world his \"Marriage of the Children of God with\nthe Children of Men,\" in which Venus is the avowed mistress of his\nadoration. It caused a fine stir, and greatly increased his repute.\n\nIn this picture he ends his Italian period and strikes his own\npersonal note. Both this and the \"Venus asking arms for Aeneas from\nVulcan,\" together with the \"Birth of Adonis\" and the \"Death of\nAdonis,\" of about the same period, still show Boucher strongly under\nthe influence of his master, Lemoyne. Indeed, the \"Birth\" and \"Death\nof Adonis,\" their record lost during the scuffle and confusion of the\nRevolution, for long hung side by side as pictures by Lemoyne, until,\nbeing cleaned about 1860, Boucher's initials were discovered upon\nthem, and, contemporary engravings being hunted up, still further\nproved their origin. But in the Venus that now figures in all his\nworks there is that flesh-painting of the nude, and that rosy touch\nupon the flesh of the female figure, that are a far more certain\nsignature of Boucher's handiwork than any written name.\n\nUnfortunately the Salons were closed during Boucher's earlier years\nuntil he was thirty-four, and the record of his work during these\nyears is difficult to follow; but with his service to Venus his\npersonal career begins, and the stream of his Venus-pieces steadily\nflows from his hands.\n\nHe came to her service rid of all prentice essays in craftsmanship, a\nfinished and consummate artist. He found in his subject a goddess to\nwhom he could devote his great and splendid gifts. He painted her\ndainty body with a radiant delight and a rare colour-sense such as\nFrance had never before seen or uttered. He remains to this day the\nfirst painter of the subtle, delicate, and elusive thing that is\nfemininity; he caught her allure, her charm, as he was to catch the\nfragrance and charm of children and flowers; and he set the statement\nof these things upon canvas as they have never been uttered.\n\nThe whole of his life long, Boucher gave himself up with equal and\npassionate devotion to work and to pleasure--working at his easel\noften twelve hours of his day without losing, to the end when the\nbrush fell from his dead fingers, his blitheness of heart or his\ngenerosity of act, and without weakening the pleasure-loving desires\nof his gadding spirit. Out of his splendid toil he made the means to\nindulge his tastes for pleasure; and the gratifying of his tastes in\nturn renewed and created the ideas that made the subjects of his\nartistry. He brought to all he did a joy in the doing that made of his\nvast labour one long pleasure--of his pleasures a riot of industry. He\nplayed as he toiled, scarce knowing which was play and which toil.\n\nThe gossip of his love-affairs makes no romantic story--they were but\ncommonplace ecstasies with unknown frail women. But hard as he worked\nand lived and played, he found time to get himself married in his\nthirtieth year to pretty seventeen-year-old Marie Jeanne Buseau, a\nlittle Parisian--and for love of her, so far as he understood the\nbusiness; for she brought him no dowry.\n\nThe young couple settled down for the next ten years in the Rue\nSaint-Thomas-du-Louvre. Here Boucher lived through his thirties.\n\nMadame was a pretty creature, if we had but Latour's pastel portrait\nalone to prove it. But the pretty features were the crown to as pretty\na body, for she sat often to her lord; and it is clear from his\ncorrespondence with a friend, Bachaumont, that she is the Psyche of\nhis illustrated fable--and Psyche runs much to the Altogether.\n\nMarriage, however, was not likely to imprison Boucher's gadding eyes;\nand it did not. Madame Boucher seems to have had as frail a heart, and\navoided strife by amusing herself, amongst others, with the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who, to gain access to the lady,\ncommissioned Boucher to do the Watteau-like illustrations to\nAcajou--a dull affair. Boucher's pretty wife, herself no mean\nartist, worked in his studio, and painted several smaller canvases\nafter his pictures, gaining some fame as a miniaturist and engraver.\n\nNor did Marriage turn Boucher from his art. Two years were gone by\nsince his nomination to the Academy; he had now to paint the formal\nHistorical Picture and present it in order to take his seat as\nAcademician; and it was in this his thirtieth year that he painted and\nwon his academic rank with the \"Renauld et Armide\" now at the Louvre.\n\nHere he sufficiently subordinated his own style to the academic to\nensure success; and the work was hailed by Academicians and critics,\nincluding Diderot, with enthusiasm. But even here we have his cupids\npeeping round the mythologic event; and Armide herself has pretty\nFrench lips that knew no Greek.\n\nOnce secure of his position, he straightway flung the last remnants of\nthe academic style out of his studio door; and it is a grim comment on\ncriticism that it was just exactly in proportion as he developed his\nown personal genius and uttered the France of his day, that he was\nattacked; whilst the stilted things that he knew were third-rate, and\nwhich he wholly rejected from henceforth, were exactly the things that\nwere praised!\n\nHis election to the Academy, and the enthusiasm over the picture that\nwon him his seat thereat, brought his name before the young king; the\nfollowing year he received his first order from the Court whose\npainter he was destined to become. The decorations in the queen's\napartments were gloomy and had grown black; and he painted in their\nstead the \"Charity,\" \"Abundance,\" \"Fidelity,\" and \"Prudence\" still\nthere to be seen. Indeed, with his gay vision, his pretty habit of\nculling only the flowers from the garden of life, and his quickness to\nset down the pleasing thing in every prospect, Boucher was the\ndestined painter of a Court weary of pomposity and the pose of the\nmock-heroic, and which was wholly giving itself up to pleasure and the\nelegances.\n\nBut neither his new dignity of Academician nor the royal favour, kept\nhim from the bookshops; and he illustrated, with rare beauty and a\ncharm worthy of Watteau, the great edition of the Works of Moli\u00e8re\nin his thirty-first year. It is true that he made as free with\nMoli\u00e8re's world as with the Gods of Olympus; he peoples the plays with\ncharacters of his own day, arrayed in the dress and habit of that day,\nand moving in surroundings that he saw about him.\n\n\nLE MONDE QUI S'AMUSE\n\n\nThe Homely had come upon the town out of Holland, painted with most\nconsummate artistry by Chardin, and was soon in the vogue. Boucher had\na quick eye for the mode. And he straightway set himself to the\npainting of \"La Belle Cuisini\u00e8re.\" Still-life and homely subjects need\nan accuracy of realism and a Dutch sense of these things, a sense of\nsincerity and an appreciation of the dignity of the work-a-day life of\nthe people, in which Boucher was wholly lacking. Above all, it calls\nfor a sense of \"character,\" which, in Boucher, was always weak. It was\na sneer against him that his very broomsticks called for pompons and\nribbons--and there was more than a little truth in the spite. He is\nmore concerned with the accident of the kissing of a kitchen-maid than\nwith the kitchen's habit. He cannot even peep into a scullery without\ndragging in Venus by the skirts, and tricking her out in a\nproperty-wardrobe of a scullery-wench, in which the girl is clearly\nbut acting the part.\n\nHowever, these passing vogues and experiments in different methods\nwere only gay asides--he was working the while upon his own subjects;\nand, to the display by its several members ordered by the Academy, he\nsent four little paintings of fauns and cupids which won him the\nhonour of election as deputy-professor. His brain and hand were very\nbusy, and he turns from one thing to another with amazing facility,\nbringing distinction to all that he does.\n\nBut he painted about this time two pictures of infants, \"L'Amour\nOiseleur\" and \"L'Amour Moissonneur,\" which were the beginning of that\nhost of cupids that he let fly from his studio; they frolic across his\ncanvases and join the retinue of Venus, peeping out from clouds, over\nwaves, round curtains, painted with a perfection that has never been\nsurpassed in the portrayal of infants. He painted their round limbs,\ntheir lusty life, their delightful awkwardnesses, their jolly fat\ngrace, their na\u00efve surprise at life and glory in it, as they had never\nbeen painted before, and have never been painted since.\n\nHe also gave forth in this his thirty-third year a \"Pastoral\" and a\n\"Shepherd and Shepherdess in Conversation,\" with sheep about them and\nin a pleasant landscape, which were his first essays in the style that\nhe created and which made him famous.\n\nHis friend Meissonnier, the inventor of the rococo, stood godfather to\nBoucher's first-born son in the May of 1736.\n\nFrom the very beginning Boucher seems to have been engraved. And these\nengravings, done by the best gravers of his day, greatly extended his\nreputation and popularised him; he fully realised the value of the\nadvertisement as well as his profits from it. Before his thirty-third\nyear was run out he published his well-known \"Cries of Paris.\"\n\nBoucher's description of them, \"studies from the low classes,\" holds\nthe key to that something of failure to realise the dramatic verities\nthat is over all; it gives also the attitude of the France that he\nknew towards the France that he did not, and could not understand. He\ncreated that dainty, pleasant atmosphere that comes floating up to the\nwindows on a fresh morning in Paris from the musical cries of\nthe street vendors; but of the deeper significance of the\nstreet-sellers--of the miserable accent in their life, of their weary\ntoil, of the dignity of their labour--he knew nothing; his brush could\nnot refrain from making elegance and fine manners peep from behind the\nstreet-porter's fustian or the milkmaid's skirt.\n\nBut his thirty-third year was to contain a more far-reaching\nsignificance even than the creation of his cupid-pieces and pastorals.\n\nThe \"Cries of Paris\" were scarce printed when Boucher's illustration\nto \"Don Quixote\" appeared--\"Sancho pursued by the servants of the\nDuke.\" This design was to have far-reaching results that Boucher\nlittle suspected.\n\nThe painter Oudry had been called to the conduct of the great tapestry\nlooms at Beauvais a couple of years before; and in his efforts to\nfurnish the looms with good designs, he now called Boucher to his aid,\nwhose original and fresh style, colour, and arrangement, together with\nhis personal vision, and the enthusiasm and zeal with which he threw\nhimself into the work, at once increased the reputation and the\nproducts of the famous looms. This large designing for the tapestries\nwas, in return, of immense value to the development of the genius of\nthe man, enlarging his breadth of style and giving scope to that great\ndecorative sense that was his superb gift. Thenceforth he was destined\nto play a supreme part in the history of the world-famed factories. He\nnow produced painting after painting for the Beauvais looms.\n\nLife is now one long triumph for Boucher, only disturbed in this year\nby the sad news of the suicide of his old master, Lemoyne. It was in\nthis, Boucher's thirty-fourth year, that the Salon was opened for the\nfirst time since Boucher's infancy, and he contributed several\ncanvases to it.\n\nRigaud, the old Academician, now close upon eighty, straggling through\nthe great galleries, might well blink and gasp at the change that had\ncome over French art since he last exhibited there, thirty-three years\ngone by; but his scoffs and regrets held no terrors for the younger\nAcademicians gathered about. He stood in a new world. A new generation\nwas in possession. The grand manner, the severe etiquette, formal\nmock-heroics, and solemn pomposity of Louis the Fourteenth were\nvanished, and the Agreeable and the Pleasant Make-Believe of Louis the\nFifteenth reigned in their stead. Old Rigaud might blink indeed! Just\nas the imposing and stilted etiquette of the reception-room had given\nplace to the easy manners and airy etiquette of the dainty boudoir, so\nhad light chatter and gay wit and the quick repartee usurped the heavy\nsplendours of a consequential age. France, weary of an eternal pose of\nthe grand manner, was seeking change in joyousness and amusement.\n\nGallantry and gaiety were become the object of the ambition of a\ndandified and elegant day. France became a coquette; dressed herself\nas a porcelain shepherdess; and with beribboned crook and sheep,\nseeking pleasant prospects to stroll through, gave herself to\ndalliance--her powder-puff and patch-box and fan a serious part of her\nunseriousness.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE CH\u00c2TEAUROUX\n\n\nAt thirty-five Boucher has arrived. He is in the vogue; in favour at\nCourt--as well as in the fashion. In his three years from taking his\nseat at the Academy to the opening of the first Salon he has created a\nnew and original style--his cupid pieces, his pastorals, his\nVenus-pieces, his tapestry. Boucher's kingdom lay in the realm of the\ndecorative painter--and he has found it. Torn from the surroundings\nfor which he designed them, as part and parcel of the general scheme,\nhis pictures are as out of place as an Italian altarpiece in an\nEnglish dining-room, yet they suffer less. Several may still be seen,\nas he set them up in frames of his own planning, as overdoors in the\npalace of the Soubise, now given up to the national archives.\n\nThe ghost of the Prince of Soubise, who commissioned them, may haunt\nhis palace, but his kin know the place no longer. The overdoors\nwrought by Boucher's skill look down now on the nation's collection of\nhistoric documents. The \"Three Graces enchaining Love,\" the fine\npastoral of \"The Cage,\" and the pastoral of the \"Shepherd placing a\nRose in his Shepherdess's Hair,\" were to see a mightier change than\nthe usurpation of Louis the Fourteenth's pompous age by the elegant\nyears of Louis the Fifteenth. But this was not as yet. Here at least\nwe see Boucher's art rid of all outside influences, and at the full\ntide of creation; here we have the inimitable lightness of touch, the\nfigures and landscape bathed in the airy volume of atmosphere.\n\nHe seems at this time to have played with pastel, due probably to his\nfriendship with Latour, who sent a portrait of Boucher's wife to this\nSalon. Boucher showed in the use of chalks the artistry and skill that\nwere always at his command.\n\nHe also was putting to its full use his innate sense of landscape,\nraising to high achievement that astonishing balance of landscape and\nfigures in his design--a balance that has never been surpassed; his\nfigures never override his landscape; his landscape never overpowers\nhis figures. His earnest counsels to his pupils and his constant\ndeploring of the lack of the landscape art in France prove the great\nstress he laid upon it.\n\nThe designing of a frontispiece for the catalogue of a personal\nfriend, one Gersaint, a merchant of oriental wares, started Boucher in\nhis thirty-third year upon that series of Chinese pictures and\ntapestries known as the \"Chinoiseries,\" in which he frittered away\nonly too many precious hours, for they were received with great favour\nby the public. The paintings of Chinese subjects designed for the\nlooms of Beauvais are still to be seen at Besan\u00e7on.\n\nBut busy as were his brain and hand in the exercise of his wide and\nversatile gifts, pouring out \"Chinoiseries,\" illustrations for books,\ntapestries on a large scale, landscapes, models for the gilt bronze\ndecorations of porcelain vases, scheming handsome frames for his\npictures, designing furniture and fans--Boucher was true, above all,\n\"to his goddess,\" and painted the famed \"Birth of Venus,\" which,\nthanks to the Swedish Ambassador's fondness for Madame Boucher, now\nhangs at Stockholm; our amorous Count de Tessin, to be just, seems to\nhave had a rare flair for the artistic--besides artist's wives. It was\non the 15th of April in 1742, the last year of his thirties, that the\nRoyal favour was marked by the grant of a pension of 400 livres\n(double florins) to Boucher with promise of early benefits to follow.\n\nTwo years afterwards it was raised to 600 livres.\n\nThis was the year that he painted the beautiful canvas of \"Diana\nleaving the Bath with one of her Companions,\" now at the Louvre. It\nwas also the year that saw his landscape, the \"Hamlet of Iss\u00e9\" at the\nSalon. This \"Hameau d'Iss\u00e9\" was to be enlarged for the Opera, proving\nhim to be decorator there, where he was arranging waterfalls,\ncascades, and the rest of the pretty business, without staying his\nhand from his art.\n\nAt forty Boucher has come into his kingdom. The ten years of these\nforties were to be a vast triumph for him. He was to produce\nmasterpiece after masterpiece. His art had caught the taste of the\nday. He was at the height of his powers. He had done great things--he\nwas to do greater. During these ten years of his forties he poured\nforth vivid and glowing works of sustained power and originality.\n\nWe have a picture of him as he was in the flesh at this time--the\npastel portrait by Lundberg, now at the Louvre--a gay, somewhat\ndissipated, handsomely dressed dandy of the time, smiling out of his\ncareless day, the debonnair man of fashion, the laughing eyes showing\nsigns of the night carousals, which were the rest from the prodigious\ntoil of this vital and forthright spirit.\n\nIt was in this our artist's fortieth year that the gifted old Cardinal\nFleury, who had guided the fortunes of France with rare skill, died,\nbroken by his ninety years and the blunders of the disastrous war that\nhe had so strenuously opposed; and Louis, essaying the strut of\nkingship, became king by act. His indolent character, unequal to the\nmighty business, his indeterminate will fretted by the set of\nquarrelling and intriguing rogues that he gathered about him as his\nministers, he fell into the habit that became his thenceforth, the\nonly thing to which he paid the tribute of constancy--he ruled France\nfrom behind pretty petticoats. He had early shown the adulterous blood\nof his great-grandfather; two, if not three, of five sisters of the\nnoble and historic house of De Nesle had yielded to his gadding fancy;\nthe youngest now ousted her sister De Mailly from the king's favour,\nwas publicly acknowledged as the king's mistress, and became Duchess\nof Ch\u00e2teauroux. Boucher painted her handsome being as a shepherdess in\none of his pastorals. She was no ordinary toy of a king. A woman of\ntalent, with hot ambitions for the king's majesty, fired with the\npride of race of the old French noblesse, it was during her short\nyears of ascendancy over the king that he roused from his body's\ntorpor and made an effort to reach the dignity and eminence befitting\nto the lord of a great and gallant people. He stepped forth awhile\nfrom his drunken bouts and manifold mean adulteries, and set himself\nat the head of the army in Flanders, and strutted it as conqueror.\n\nPoor Ch\u00e2teauroux only got the hate of the people for reward, Louis the\nhonours; for the people resented the public dishonour of her state.\n\nPower she found to be a dead-sea apple in her pretty mouth. The glory\nof it all, the splendours, were not the easily won delights for which\nshe had looked. She had to fight a duel, that never ended, with the\nking's witty, crafty, and scurrilous Prime Minister, the notorious\nMaurepas--and Maurepas willed that no woman should ever come between\nhim and the king--Maurepas who knew no mercy, no decency, no chivalry,\nno scruple. At Ch\u00e2teauroux's urging, Louis placed himself at the\nhead of the army; and France went near mad with joy that she had\nagain found a king. Crafty Maurepas urged on the business; the\nCh\u00e2teauroux suddenly realised his cunning glee--it separated her from\nthe king.\n\nOut of the whirl of things Boucher's fortune was ripening, little as\nhe might suspect it.\n\nHe was painting masterpieces that make his name live. To his fortieth\nyear belong the famed \"Birth of Venus,\" the \"Venus leaving the Bath,\"\nthe \"Muse Clio,\" the \"Muse Melpomene,\" and the three well-known\npastorals now at the Louvre--\"The Sleeping Shepherdess,\" the \"Nest,\"\n\n\nand the \"Shepherd and Shepherdesses.\" Of the many famous Venus-pieces\nthat his hand painted during these years it is not easy to write the\nlist. But having signed the \"Marriage of Love and Psyche\" at\nforty-one, he turned his experimental hand to the homely, realistic\nDutch style that was having a wide vogue, and painted the\n\"Dejeuner\"--a family of the prosperous class of the day at\nbreakfast--showing with rare charm the surroundings and home life of\nthe well-to-do of his time.\n\nAll goes well with Boucher. He changes into better quarters in the Rue\nde Grenelle-Saint-Honor\u00e9, where he lived for the next five years,\nuntil 1749; but his eyes are fixed upon a studio and apartments at\nthe old palace of the Louvre, though the hard intriguing of his\npowerful friends at Court on his behalf failed for some time. He had,\nindeed, to make another move before he arrived at his longed-for goal.\n\nPensions Boucher, like others, had found to be somewhat empty affairs;\nbut rooms at the Louvre were a solid possession eagerly sought after\nby the artists.\n\nIn this year of 1744 Boucher created a new fashion at the annual Salon\nby sending studies and sketches instead of finished pictures; and it\nset a value upon such things not before realised by artists, for\nsuccess was instant and loud.\n\nTowards the end of the next, Boucher's forty-second year, the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who was to take his leave of Paris,\ncommissioned four pictures to represent the day of a woman of fashion,\nand to be entitled \"Morning,\" \"Midday,\" \"Evening,\" and \"Night.\"\n\nBoucher painted one of these for him, now known as the \"Marchande de\nModes.\" The others were painted later, and all had a wide vogue as\nengravings. The correspondence has interest since it reveals Boucher's\nbusiness habits; he was paid for a picture on its delivery, and for\neach of these he was to receive 600 livres (double florins or\ndollars)--about a hundred and twenty pounds.\n\nIn an official document of the Director of Buildings to the king (or\nMinister of Fine Art, as we should say), written in this year of 1745,\nBoucher being forty-two, is a \"list of the best painters,\" in which\nBoucher is singled out for distinction as \"an historic painter, living\nin the Rue de Grenelle-Saint-Honor\u00e9, opposite the Rue des Deux-Ecus,\npupil of Lemoyne, excelling also in landscape, grotesques, and\nornaments in the manner of Watteau; and equally skilled in painting\nflowers, fruit, architecture, and subjects of gallantry and of\nfashion.\"\n\nNot so bad for dry officialdom; the critics could learn a lesson. For\nhe was nothing less. What indeed does he not do? and wondrous well!\nthis painter of the age.\n\nAnd the mighty rush of events is about to sweep him into further\nprominence; the very things which he probably passed by with a gay\nshrug are to enrich him, to help him to his highest fulfilment.\n\nPoor Ch\u00e2teauroux saw that she must lose the king's gadding favour in\nthe conflict with Maurepas unless she joined her lord, now with the\narmy. She realised full well that she had created the new Louis of\nAmbition--that her going must bring the people's hate to her. But she\ndared not lose the king. And she went. Maurepas had overdone his\njibings. The indiscretion at once rang through the land; became the\njest of the army--and Maurepas was not far from the bottom of the\nbusiness. The discreet indiscretion of covered ways between the king's\nlodgings and hers only added to the mockeries, and increased the\npeople's hate against, of course, the Ch\u00e2teauroux. Then upon a day in\nAugust the small-pox seized Louis at Metz; poor Ch\u00e2teauroux fought for\npossession of the king in the sick room, until his fear of\ndeath--Louis' sole piety--sent her packing--shrinking back in the\nhired carriage at each halting-place for change of horses, lest she\nshould be seen and torn from her place and destroyed by the populace.\n\nBut Louis recovered; Paris rang with bells at joy on his recovery, and\nhe entered the city amidst mad enthusiasm, hailed as The Well-Beloved.\n\nHe sent for the Ch\u00e2teauroux to find her dying, Maurepas having to\ndeliver the message of recall. She died suddenly and in great agony,\nswearing that Maurepas had poisoned her--died in the arms of her poor\ndiscarded sister, the De Mailly.\n\nBut this year of 1745 Boucher hears a mightier scandal that is to mean\nvast things to all France--and not least of all to Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE POMPADOUR\n\n\nA young bride had become the gossip of the rich merchant society of\nParis--that class that was ousting the old noblesse from power. She\nwas a beautiful, a remarkable woman; her wit was repeated in the\ndrawing-rooms, she had all the accomplishments; her charming\nname--Madame Lenormant d'Etioles.\n\nDraw aside the curtains of the past and we discover our little Jeanne\nPoisson--grown into this exquisite creature. It has come about in\nstrange fashion enough. The father--a scandalous fellow--having\nfingered the commissariat moneys in ugly ways to his own use, had been\nbanished for the ugly business. Nor is Jeanne's mother any better than\nshe should be; and the wags wink knowingly at the handsome and rich\nman of fashion, Monsieur Lenormant de Tournehem, who has been the\nfavoured gallant during the absence of the light-fingered Poisson.\n\nAnd, of a truth, Lenormant de Tournehem takes astonishing interest in\nthe little Jeanne--watching over her up-growing and giving her the\nbest of education at the convent, where she wins all hearts, and is\nknown as \"the little queen.\" The truth spoken with wondrous prophecy,\nif unthinkingly, as we shall see. Complacent Poisson came home, and\ntook the rich and fashionable, bland and smiling Lenormant de\nTournehem to his arms. Has he not wealth and estates? therefore as\nexcellent a friend for Poisson as for Madame Poisson. The girl Jeanne\nleaves the convent to be taught the accomplishments by the supreme\nmasters of France, the wits foregather at Madame Poisson's, and the\nbrilliant Jeanne is soon mistress of the arts--coquetry not least of\nall; has also the most exquisite taste in dress. Under all is a heart\ncold as steel; calculating as the higher mathematics. She has but one\nhindrance to ambition--her mean birth. Lenormant de Tournehem rids her\neven of this slur by making his nephew, Lenormant d'Etioles, marry\nher, giving the young couple half his fortune for dowry, and the\npromise of the rest when he dies--also he grants him a splendid\ntown-house, as splendid a country seat. And consequential\nself-respecting little Lenormant d'Etioles is lord of Etioles, amongst\nother seignories. So Jane Fish appears as Madame Lenormant d'Etioles,\nseductive, beautiful, accomplished, to whose house repair the new\nphilosophy, the wits, and artists. She has a certain sense of virtue;\nindeed openly vows that no one but the king shall ever come between\nher and her lord. But, deep in her heart, she has harboured a fierce\nambition--that the king shall help her to keep her bond. She puts\nforth all her gifts, all her powers, to win to the strange goal;\nconfides it to her worldly mother and \"uncle,\" Lenormant de Tournehem;\nfinds keen allies therein to the reaching of that strange goal. The\ndeath of the Ch\u00e2teauroux clears the way. At a masked ball the king is\nintrigued as to the personality of a beautiful woman who plagues him\nwith her art; he orders the unmasking. Madame Lenormant d'Etioles\nstands revealed, drops her handkerchief as by accident; the whisper\nruns through the Court that \"the handkerchief has been thrown!\" The\nking stoops and picks it up. A few evenings later she is smuggled into\nthe \"private apartments.\" She goes again a month later; in the morning\nis seized with sudden terror--she daren't go back to her angry lord\nlest he do her grievous harm; he will have missed her. The king is\ntouched; allows her to hide from henceforth in the secret apartments;\npromises the beautiful creature a lodging, her husband's banishment,\nand early acknowledgment as titular mistress--before the whole Court\nat Easter, says the pious Great One. But he has to join the army to\nplay the Conqueror at Fontenoy; and it is later in the year\n(September) before Madame d'Etioles is presented to the Court in a\nvast company and proceeds to the queen's apartments to kiss hands on\nappointment. Thus was Jeanne Poisson raised to the great aristocracy\nof France in her twenty-third year as Marquise de Pompadour.\n\nBoucher had been one of the brilliant group of artists of the\nd'Etioles' circle. That the Pompadour's influence had much effect upon\nhis position at Court for a year or two is unlikely; for she had to\nfight for possession of the king day and night, as the Ch\u00e2teauroux\nhad done, against the queen's party and the unscrupulous enmity of\nMaurepas. To set down Boucher's favour at Court to her is ridiculous.\n\nHe was painting for the queen's apartments at thirty-one when the\nPompadour was a school-girl of twelve. But in the year following her\nrise to power, Boucher painted four pictures for the large room of the\nDauphin, which were \"placed elsewhere\"; and, the year after that, he\nwas at work upon two pictures for the bedroom of the king at the\ncastle of Marly. It is likely enough that the Pompadour directed this\norder. She had almost immediately secured the office of the\nDirector-General of Buildings, which covered the direction of the\nroyal art treasures, for \"uncle\" Lenormant de Tournehem, who was also\na friend of the artist. And from this year it is significant that\nBoucher paints no more for the opposing camp of the Queen and Dauphin.\n\nHe was now giving all his strength to the \"Rape of Europa\" that he\npainted for the competition ordered by the Academy at the command of\nLenormant de Tournehem in the king's name, in which ten chosen\nAcademicians were to paint subjects in their own style for six prizes\nand a gold medal, to be awarded in secret vote by the competing\nartists themselves. Boucher won, by his amiable nature, the good-will\nof them all by proposing that they should so arrange as to share the\nprizes equally, and thus prevent any sense of soreness inevitable in\nthe losers.\n\nBut greatly as he won the good-fellowship of his fellow-artists by it,\nthis picture caused a murmur to rise amongst the critics who,\naforetime loud in his praise, now began to complain of his \"abuse of\nrose tints\" in the painting of the female nude. The fact was that\nDiderot and the men of the New Philosophy were turning their eyes to\nthe whole foundations upon which France was built, art as well as\nsociety, and were beginning to demand of art \"grandeur and morality in\nits subjects.\" They were soon to be clamouring for \"the statement of a\ngreat maxim, a lesson for the spectator.\" Diderot, with bull-like\ncourage, picked out the greatest, and turned upon Boucher, blaming him\nfor triviality.\n\nThe nations, weary of war, concluded the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in\nthe October of 1748. No sooner was peace concluded than Louis\nrelapsed into his old habit of dandified indolence and profligate\nease; and, putting from him his duties as the lord of a great people,\nhe gave himself up to shameless intrigues. He allowed the Pompadour to\nusurp his magnificence and to rule over the land. He yielded himself\nutterly, if sometimes sulkily, to her domination; and for sixteen\nyears she was the most powerful person at Court, the greatest force in\nthe state--making and unmaking ministers, disposing of office,\nhonours, titles, pensions. All political affairs were discussed and\narranged under her guidance; ministers, ambassadors, generals\ntransacted their business in her stately boudoirs; the whole patronage\nof the sovereign was dispensed by her pretty hands; the prizes of the\nChurch, of the army, of the magistracy could be obtained solely\nthrough her favour and good-will. Her energy must have been\nprodigious. Possessed of extraordinary talents and exquisite tastes,\nshe gave full rein to them, and it was in the indulgence of her better\nqualities that Destiny brought Boucher into the friendship of this\nwonderful woman. She became not only his patron but his pupil,\nengraving several of his designs.\n\nBut this, her sovereignty over the king, easy and light in its outward\nseeming, was a haggard nightmare to the calculating woman who had so\nlonged for it. She knew no single hour's rest from the night she won\nto the king's bed. She had to fight her enemies, secret and open, for\npossession of the king's will, day and night; and she fought--with\nrare courage. She won by consummate skill and unending pluck. She made\nherself an essential part of the king's freedom from care. The Court\nparty fought her for power with constant vigilance. Maurepas brought\nall his unscrupulous art, all his ironic mimicry, all his vile jibes\nand unchivalrous hatred to bear against her. He had made himself a\nnecessity to the king; and he never slept away a chance of injuring\nher. He knew no mercy, no nobility, no pity. He made her the detested\nobject of the people. With his own hands he penned the witty verses\nand epigrams that were sung and flung about the streets of Paris.\n\nBut she had an enemy more subtle than any at the Court--hour by hour\nshe had to dispute the king with the king's boredom. And it was in the\neffort to do so that she created her celebrated theatre in the\nprivate apartments, calling Boucher and others to her aid in the doing\nof it. Here the noblest of France vied with each other to obtain the\nsmallest part to play, an instrument in its orchestra, an invitation\nto its performances.\n\nBoucher left the Opera to become its decorator in 1748, and did not\nreturn until her death. For her, he also decorated her beautiful rooms\nat Bellevue. She bought at high prices many of his greatest\nmasterpieces.\n\nThe Pompadour's power so greatly increased that she openly took\ncommand of the king's will; dared and succeeded in getting his\nfavourite Maurepas banished; and herself took to the use of the kingly\n\"we.\" Her rascally father was created Lord of Marigny; her brother,\nwhom the king liked well and called \"little brother,\" was created\nMarquis de Vandi\u00e8res; her only child, Alexandrine, signed her name as\na princess of the blood royal, and would have been married to the\nblood royal had she not caught the small-pox and died. She amassed a\nprivate fortune, castles, and estates such as no mistress had dreamed\nof; and into them she poured art treasures that cost the nation\nthirty-six millions of money. She created the porcelain factory of\nS\u00e8vres, kept keen watch over the Gobelins looms, and founded the great\nMilitary School of St. Cyr amidst work that would have kept several\nstatesmen busy, and of deadly intrigues at Court that would have\nbroken the spirit of many a brilliant man.\n\nIt was in her hectic desire to keep the king from being bored that she\nstooped, and made Boucher stoop, to the employment of his high\nartistry in the painting of a series of indecent pictures wherewith to\ntickle the jaded desires of Boredom, and thereby gave rise to the\nwidespread impression that Boucher's art was ever infected by base\ndesign. But Boucher was, at his very worst, but a healthy animal; and\neven in these secret works for the king he did not reach so low as did\nmany an artist of more pious memory who painted with no excuse but his\nown pleasure.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the Pompadour has been blamed too much for this\nevil act, and too much forgotten for her splendid patronage of the man\nwho, under it and during these great years of his forties, produced a\nseries of masterpieces that place him in the foremost rank of the\npainters of his century. It is impossible to reckon the number of the\npastorals and Venus-pieces that his master-hand painted and loved to\npaint, during these the supreme years of his genius. It is significant\nthat they were painted during the years that saw the Pompadour in\nsupreme power.\n\nBoucher was so firmly established in 1750, his forty-seventh year,\nthat he moved into a new house in the Rue Richelieu, near the Palais\nRoyal. Disappointed in not receiving a studio and apartments at the\nLouvre, he was allowed to use a studio in the king's library. He was\nnow making money so easily that he was able to collect pictures and\nprecious stones and the gaily coloured curiosities that appealed to\nhis tastes.\n\nThe critics were becoming more and more censorious; and one of them\nhits true with the comment that in his pastorals his shepherdesses\nlook as if they had stepped over from the Opera and would soon be off\nagain thereto.\n\nIn his forty-eighth year Boucher's art was at its most luminous\nstage--his atmosphere clear and subtle and exquisitely rendered; his\nyellows golden; his whites satin-like and silvery; his flesh-tones\nupon the nude bodies of his goddesses unsurpassed by previous art. The\nbeauty of it all was not to last much longer.\n\nLenormant de Tournehem died suddenly in the November of 1751; the\nPompadour's brother, Abel Poisson de Vandi\u00e8res, was appointed\nDirector-General in his stead at the age of twenty-five--and soon\nafterwards, on the death of his father, created Marquis de Marigny--a\nshy, handsome youth, a gentleman and an honourable fellow, whom the\nking liked well, and against whom his sister's sole complaint was that\nhe lacked the brazen effrontery of the courtiers of the day. No man\ndid more for the advancement of the art of his time. A pension of a\nthousand livres falling vacant, the young fellow secured it for\nBoucher; and almost immediately afterwards, a studio becoming vacant\nat the Louvre owing to the death of Coypel, first painter to the king,\nBoucher came to his coveted home, eagerly moving in with his family as\nsoon as its wretched state could be put into repair.\n\nThe decoration of the new wing to the palace at Fontainebleau brought\nthe commission for the painting of the ceiling and the principal\npicture in the Council Chamber to Boucher, who had already decorated\nthe Dining-Room. This was the period of his painting the \"Rising\" and\nthe \"Setting of the Sun\" for the Pompadour, now in the Watteau\ncollection, two canvases that were always favourites with the painter,\nbitterly as they were assailed by the critic Grimm.\n\nHe was turning out so much work that it was impossible to give as much\ncare to his pictures as he ought. For he refused sternly, his life\nlong, to raise his prices; by consequence he had to create a larger\namount of work in order to meet his expenditure. It was about this\ntime that Reynolds, passing through Paris, went to visit him and found\nhim painting on a huge canvas without models or sketches. \"On\nexpressing my surprise,\" writes Reynolds, \"he replied that he had\nconsidered the model as necessary during his youth until he had\ncompleted his study of art, but that he had not used one for a long\ntime past.\"\n\nHe soon had not the time, not only to paint from nature but even to\ngive his pictures the work necessary to complete them. The feverish\nhaste which took possession of him in his frantic endeavour to meet\nthe vast demand for his pictures, and the eager efforts of his\nengravers to satisfy the public call for engravings after his works,\ngave him less and less leisure to joy in their doing. And his eyesight\nbegan to fail. His flesh-tints deepened to a reddish hue; and he\nstands baffled before his work, suspecting his sight, since what every\none cries out upon as being bright vermilion, he only sees as a dull\nearthy colour. Boucher has topped the height of his achievement; he\nhas to \"descend the other side of the hill.\" Boucher begins to grow\nold.\n\nIn Boucher's fifty-first year an ugly intrigue of the queen's party at\nCourt to sap the Pompadour's influence over the king by drawing away\nthe king's affections towards Madame de Choiseul-Romanet, a reckless\nyoung beauty of the Court, brought about a strange alliance. The Count\nde Stainville, one of the Pompadour's bitterest enemies, was shown the\nking's letter of invitation to his young kinswoman; and he, deeply\nwounded in his pride that his kinswoman should have been offered to\nthe king, went to the Pompadour and exposed the plot. A close\nalliance followed; and De Stainville thenceforth became her chief\nguide in affairs of state. It was at her instance that the king called\nhim to be his Prime Minister, raising him to the Duchy of Choiseul--a\nname he made illustrious as one of the greatest Ministers of France.\n\nIn his fifty-second year Boucher was appointed to the directorship of\nthe Gobelins looms, to the huge delight of the weavers and all\nconcerned with the tapestry factory. This was the year of his painting\nthe famous portrait of the Pompadour, to whom he several times paid\nthis \"tribute of immorality.\" For the Gobelins looms he produced many\nhandsome designs; and he was painting with astounding industry. But\nhis hand's skill began to falter. His art shows weariness in his\nsixtieth year, and sickness fell upon him, and held him in servitude\nnow with rare moments of respite. The critics, notoriously Diderot,\nwere now attacking him with shameless virulence. Boucher passed it all\nby; but he felt the change that was taking place in the public taste.\n\nThe ideas of the New Philosophy were infecting public opinion; the Man\nof Feeling had arisen in the land; and France, humiliated in war, and\nresenting the follies and the greed of her shameless privileged class,\nwas openly resenting it and all its works. Choiseul had planted his\nstrength deep in the people's party, and was come near to being its\ngod. His masterly mind had checked Frederick of Prussia to the North;\nand the nations, exhausted by the struggle, signed the Peace of Paris\nin 1763. Choiseul, with France at peace abroad, turned to the blotting\nout of the turbulent order of the Jesuits at home. Their attempt to\nend the Pompadour's relations with the king made this powerful woman\neager to complete his design; the chance was soon to come, and the\nOrder was abolished from France and its vast property seized by the\nstate.\n\nThe Pompadour lived but a short while to enjoy her triumph. Worn out\nby her superhuman activities, assailed by debt, she fell ill of a\nracking cough, dying on the 15th of April, 1764, in her forty-second\nyear, keeping her ascendancy over the king and the supreme power in\nFrance to her last hour. Death found her transacting affairs of state.\n\nLouis, weary of his servitude, had only a heartless epigram to cast\nat the body of the dead woman as she passed to her last resting-place.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE END\n\n\nThe death of the Pompadour robbed Boucher of a friend; but her\nbrother, Marigny, remained faithfully attached to the old artist, and\nseized every chance to honour him. On the death of Carle van Loo,\nBoucher, at sixty-two, was made first painter to the king, with all\nhis pensions and privileges that were consistent with this the supreme\nappointment in the art world.\n\nThere had been serious intention of making Boucher the head of the\nEcole des El\u00e8ves Proteg\u00e9s; he had the art of making himself liked and\nof inspiring the love of the arts. He was very popular with the\nstudents and artists, owing to his kindliness, his eagerness to render\nservice, his readiness to encourage the youngsters or to console them.\n\nWhen the riot took place, provoked by the Academicians by their award\nof the Prix de Rome in 1767, the students insulted the Academicians,\nbut hailed Boucher with enthusiastic applause. The reason was not far\nto seek. When a student came to the old master for advice he did not\n\"play the pontiff,\" and, scorning the false dignity of big phrases, he\ntook the brush in his hand and showed the way out of all difficulties\nby simplehearted example, despising rules, and putting himself out in\norder to make things clear to a young artist.\n\nHowever, the Academicians feared he would be an unorthodox master for\nyouth, and appointed another in his place.\n\nA long and serious illness thwarted his keen energies. Diderot was\ngiving himself up to outrageous violence against him. If the old\npainter exhibited at the Salon, Diderot fiercely assailed his art; if\nhe did not exhibit, Diderot as bitterly assailed him for his\nnegligences. Above all, he attacked Boucher in that he did not paint\nwhat Diderot would have painted--but could not. \"When he paints\ninfants,\" cries Diderot, \"you will not find one employed in a real act\nof life--studying his lesson, reading, writing, stripping hemp.\"\n\nPoor unfortunate infants! for whom Philosophy could find no happier\njoy in life than stripping hemp! Boucher was but an artist. He\npainted his generation as far as he could see it, and, with all his\nfaults and weaknesses, he never debauched his art with foreign and\nalien things that had no part in the nation's life; he painted fair\nFrance into his landscapes, not a make-believe land he did not know\nwith preposterous Greek ruins; and best of all, to his eternal honour,\nhe painted infants glad in their gladness to be alive, with no desire\nto send their happy little bodies to school, with no sickly ambition\nto make them into budding philosophers, with no thought of making them\npose and lie as Men of Feeling. He had no joy in setting their little\nbodies to toil--in making them \"teach a lesson to the spectator,\" in\nmaking them stoop their little shoulders to the \"picking of hemp.\"\n\nHe continued to paint as he had always painted--except that he painted\nless well. The wreath of roses was wilting on a grey head. The blood\njigged less warmly in the frail body. The features showed pallid--the\neyes haggard. The sight failed. The hand alone kept something of its\ncunning.\n\nHe went to Holland with his friend Randon du Boisset, but health\nshrank farther from him. Diderot had near spent his last jibe.\n\nIn 1768, Boucher's sixty-fifth year, the neglected queen went to her\ngrave. The king's grief and contrition and vows to amend his life came\ntoo late, and lasted little longer than the drying of the floods of\ntears over the body of his dead consort. A year later he was become\nthe creature of a pretty woman of the gutters, whom he caused to be\nmarried to the Count du Barry--the infamously famous Madame du Barry.\n\nBut neither the remonstrances of Choiseul with the king against this\nfurther degradation of the throne of France, nor his unconcealed scorn\nof the upstart countess, nor the dangerous enemy he made for himself\nthereby, signified now to Boucher, first painter to the king.\n\nBoucher was failing. His son was a prig and a disappointment. His two\nfavourite pupils, Baudoin and Deshayes, who had married his two girls,\ndied.\n\nTo the Salon of 1769 he sent his \"Caravan of Bohemians.\" It was his\nlast display. He had been going about for some time like a gaunt ghost\nof his former self, afflicted with all the ills inevitable to a life\nfeverishly consumed in work and the pursuit of pleasure.\n\nThey went to his studio at five of the clock one May morning, and\nfound him seated at his easel, before a canvas of Venus, dead, with\nthe paint-filled brush fallen out of his fingers.\n\nSo passed he away on the 30th of May 1770, in his sixty-seventh year.\n\nWhen Boucher died, the generation of which he was the limner was near\ncome to its violent end. The rosy carnivals and gay gallantries of his\nage gave way to the blood-stained romance and fierce tempest of the\nRevolution. The garrets of the old curiosity-shops received the\ndiscarded canvases of the master. His shepherds and shepherdesses were\nput to rout by the Romans of his pupil, citizen David. The old order\nwas brought into contempt and overthrown. And with it, Boucher's art,\nlike much that was gracious and charming and good in the evil thing,\nwent down also, and was overwhelmed for a while.\n\nFor a while only. For just as, out of the blood and terror of the\nRevolution, a real France arose, phnix-wise, from the ruin, and in\nbeing born, whilst putting off the vilenesses of the thing from which\nshe sprang, took on also to herself the gracious and winsome qualities\nthat place her amongst the most fascinating peoples of the ages; so\nBoucher has come into his kingdom again--the most gracious of painters\nthat the years have yielded."

                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n        a. One bed, or folding cot,\n        b. One oil stove,\n        c. One lamp,\n        d. Enough supplies of all kinds sufficient for six months,\n        e. Pots, pans, kettles, etc.\nIt is needless to say that positions in Manila and Iloilo were now at\na premium.\n\nWas it possible that teachers were to be sent to places where even the\nnecessaries of life could not be obtained! Was it possible that many\nwould be sent to places so remote that for six months no fresh\nsupplies could be gotten! A mass meeting was held at once, and a\ncommittee was appointed to send a cablegram to the Associated Press\npetitioning aid from the American people at large. Realizing what\nconsternation would be created throughout the United States by such a\nmessage, two of the teachers leaped into a carriage at the close of\nthe meeting and a few moments later were closeted with the chief\nexecutive of the department. As a result the committee was persuaded\nnot to send the cablegram to the Associated Press until by courtesy it\nhad been sent to the President. Of course, this diplomatic move tided\naffairs over and the teachers who had flatly refused to budge from\nManila now agreed to go on to their stations, being assured that\nwhatever action was best would be taken.\n\nThe day had come when we must separate. We were to enter an untried\nand an unknown field. It was fitting that we have a final joyous\nmeeting, so the best orchestra in the archipelago was engaged and we\n\"chased the hours with flying feet\" until dawn so that whatever might\ncome to us in that unknown future upon which we were entering each\nwould hold in pleasant memory our last evening together.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER III. - A DRAMA IN ACTUAL LIFE.\n\n\nAlmost every one heeded the warning to go to his station forearmed\nwith at least necessaries of life, but, as it had never fallen to the\nlot of the writer to cook, he refused to learn at that late day, so he\ntook no pot, no pan, no kettle, putting his future into the hands of\nan uncertain fate and relying upon the unknown hospitality of the\nFilipino.\n\nBacalod, the capital of the province of Occidental Negros, was our\ndestination. The second morning after leaving Manila, we awoke with\nthe \"Kilpatrick\" lying at anchor in a shallow bay. We were several\nmiles from the shore and nothing in sight indicated that we had\nreached a place of any importance. Late the night before we had been\nawakened by the loud, sharp ringing of the ship's bells, accompanied\nby the reversal of the engines and a general disturbance awaking the\ncrew. So our first impressions on coming on deck were that we had run\naground. But the captain assured us that everything was ship-shape and\nthat this was the nearest point of approach to Capiz, a town of\nconsiderable importance on the island of Panay, where a body of troops\nwas to embark for home. Not even the grass hut of a native was in\nsight. Search as we would, not a sign was seen of a stream flowing\ninto the sea, indicating the probable presence of a town. There was\nnot a sign of life of any kind save one lone column of thin, blue\nsmoke that arose from the side of a mountain miles away. One would\nhave thought that we were explorers of three hundred years ago lying\noff the shore of some unknown land.\n\nAfter breakfast the steam launch, together with all the boats, was\nlowered, and several of us who had determined to miss no opportunity\nto gather information about the islands took our places in the launch\nby the side of the ship's mate, and steamed away across the water with\na long line of boats strung out in the rear. We headed away toward a\ngroup of cocoanut trees, and about an hour later stepped ashore on a\npile of decayed coral rocks that extended some twenty or thirty feet\nout into the water, thus forming the only landing place of a town of\nseveral thousands of people and of considerable commercial importance.\n\nA few moments after we had landed, an army wagon drawn by a\nmagnificent pair of mules came up out of a tropical jungle along a\nnarrow road. We clambered into the wagon and were soon lost in the\ndepths of foliage from which we had just seen the vehicle emerge.\n\nLong waving bamboos with their plumy leafage hung over the road from\neach side, meeting and overlapping in the center until they formed an\narchway so dense that the tropical sun now high in the heavens\npenetrated it only at intervals. At times the wagon sank up to the\nhubs in the soft earth, and the muscles of the mules stood out like\nwhip-cords under the skin as they drew us forward.\n\nAt a sharp turn in the road we came upon the first division of troops\nthat was to embark for home. The look of joy upon their sun-browned\nfaces was inexpressible. Their work was done, and with elastic step\nand smiling faces they saluted us as they passed by. The reign of\nforce was at an end; it was going out with them; the reign of peace\nhad begun; it was coming in with us.\n\nIn the afternoon when we returned from the town the last of the troops\nhad arrived and, as we drove up, the bugle was sounding the call to\nsupper. We noticed native women mingling with the troops and, indeed,\na native woman was in constant attention waiting upon one of the\nsoldiers with whom we ate. Her clothes were clean, her hair was nicely\ncombed, and her general appearance was neat. She seemed to anticipate\nthe slightest wish of the soldier with whom she was. She brought him\nwater to drink, cleaned his plate after the meal and saw that his\nknife, fork, and spoon were put into his haversack.\n\nWe had now finished supper and the launch had returned for the last\nload of troops. The lieutenant in command of the company gave the\norder to \"fall in\"; the men shouldered their rifles and fell into\nline. \"Forward, march!\" called the lieutenant, and the column swept\nforward towards the boats. The women had until now restrained\nthemselves, but, as their husbands marched away never to return, their\nfeelings could no longer be restrained. One young woman of about\neighteen, who was leaning against a rock by the roadside sobbing, when\nher husband passed, leaped up in frenzy of passionate love and caught\nthe rifle from his shoulder. Her first impulse seemed to be to throw\nthe gun away, but suddenly realizing the futility of such an act she\nburst into tears, shouldered the rifle herself and marched on by his\nside. Another woman of more mature age threw her arms around the legs\nof a tall stalwart man, and drew him bodily from the line.\n\nBut the troops marched on and entered the boats. One woman who had\nbeen unnoticed before came down into the shallow water and caught hold\nof our last boat as if to prevent its leaving, while others stood\nmingling their sobs with the sounds of the wavelets as they broke on\nthe sands. As we passed away, an expectant mother, standing in bold\noutline against the twilight sky, threw up her hands in an agony of\ndespair and then sank upon the stones. The curtain had fallen upon a\ndrama in actual life deeper in pathos than any other we had ever seen\nor ever expected to see. Depth of passion, depth of love! Who can\nfathom the human heart?\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. - WHAT THE TEACHERS DID.\n\n\nThere is a remarkable sameness about the towns in the Philippines.\n\nThey all have a large open square about the middle of the town, around\nthree sides of which are Chinese stores, unless one side lies open to\nthe sea, and on the fourth is the great stone ecclesia. The streets\nrun at right angles to one another and divide up the town into\ncreditable squares.\n\nEverybody in the Philippines lives up-stairs, for the ground is so\nsoaked with water during the rainy season that it is a menace to\nhealth to live upon the ground floor. So even the poorest nippa hut\nis built upon stakes four or five feet above the ground.\n\nBacalod is a typical Philippine town. As we landed, a broad open\nsquare was spread out before us. Two sides of the square were lined\nwith two-story houses in which were Chinese stores below and Filipino\nhomes above. On the third side stood the great stone church in whose\nmassive tower the clock was striking the hour of four, while the\nfourth lay open to the sea that had borne us thither.\n\nWe landed, but it was in a method new to us and one not usually\nemployed by the traveling public.\n\nWhen our sail boat ran aground on the sandy bottom a hundred yards or\nmore from the shore, a crowd of Filipino men who were on the beach\nslowly rolled up their pantaloons and waded out to the rescue,--for\nthe money that was in it. The boat's crew elevated their trousers'\nlegs also and slided down into the water. Each of us then straddled\nthe neck of a Filipino standing in the water and was held by ankles to\nbe steadied while our biped mounts proceeded to the shore.\n\nWe were now on the ground and face to face with the situation. To give\nthe reader an idea of the actual conditions met by the first teachers\nwho went to the Islands, the following is copied from the instructions\ngiven us in Manila:\n    1. There shall be two sessions daily of all schools, and the\n    last hour of the morning session shall be devoted solely to\n    instructing the Filipino teachers.\n\n    2. In cases where teachers are sent to a town in which there\n    is no school-house, they are expected to secure the aid of the\n    people and have one built.\n\n    3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is\n    stopped.\n\n    4. All supplies must be kept under lock and key. In towns\n    where there is no case or box to lock the supplies in, and it\n    is also impossible to get the town council to furnish a case,\n    a requisition may be sent to Manila, and, if an appropriation\n    can be secured, one will be made and sent out.\n\nThus it can be easily seen that we were indeed pioneers. In many\nplaces no school-house was to be found, and in some cases it was even\ndifficult to get the town council to provide a case in which to keep\nthe supplies.\n\nThe work of the teachers was, in short; to \"make the English language\nthe basis of instruction in the public schools.\" On our arrival at\nBacalod two schools were found in progress, for some soldiers had been\ndetailed for the work here previous to our coming. One of these was\nfor boys and the other, for girls. Thus the work here had been in a\nmeasure simplified, but complications that had arisen at Talisay, one\nof the largest and richest towns on the island, demanded a change of\nteachers and the writer was assigned to the place as superintendent.\n\nHere an attempt had been made to start a school but it had failed\nignominiously and a system of education was to be put into operation\nfrom the very start.\n\nThe Filipinos are not strong advocates of co-education, so separate\nschools were to be started for the boys and the girls. The one for the\nboys was gotten well in hand before the one for the girls was\nattempted at all.\n\nA few days after reaching the town and securing a home the\npresidente of the town had it publicly announced that the following\nMonday morning at eight o'clock a public school for boys would be\nopened in a building that had been rented for the purpose by the\nmunicipal council. About the middle of the afternoon of the same day a\nman beat a little drum throughout all the streets of the town to call\nthe people out and the town clerk announced both in Spanish and in the\nnative language that this public school would begin at the time and\nplace mentioned above; that instruction would be free to all who came;\nthat the government would furnish all supplies; and that instruction\nwould be given in the English language. A native principal and\nassistants were employed and everything was ready to begin.\n\nThe official report of the result is as follows:\n    Boys' public school of Talisay, Negros, P. I., began November\n    4, 1901. Forty-three boys present at eight o'clock. Forty-one\n    of them knew \"good morning\" and \"good afternoon\" but do not\n    know the distinction between them. Two of them speak simple\n    Spanish. At eight forty-five, eight more, who had been\n    attending an early morning private school, came in together.\n\n    The books they brought were so varied and so different from\n    one another that it seemed impossible to bring any reasonable\n    degree of order out of such a chaos, and so, after struggling\n    vainly for about a week with the problem, the superintendent\n    by one fell stroke removed everything in use and put in a\n    uniform system, and from that day on the English language has\n    been the basis of instruction in the public schools of\n    Talisay. The work was of necessity very slow at first, but by\n    the end of a year two schools were going nicely and a number\n    of the brightest boys and girls had made really excellent\n    progress.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER V. - A \"BAILE.\"\n\n\nNot long after the arrival of our party at Bacalod we received an\ninvitation to a \"baile\" given in our honor by the inhabitants of\nSilay, a town some ten or twelve miles up the northern coast and one\nnoted for its social life. The invitation was accepted with pleasure,\nand about the middle of the afternoon on the day appointed we were\nclad in the immaculate white of the tropics and steaming away up the\ncoast on board a launch sent for our conveyance. Twilight was still\nlingering on the path of day when we anchored just off shore at the\ntown. A row-boat containing the officials of the city came out to meet\nus and, in due season, we were ushered into a spacious drawing-room\nfilled almost to overflowing with the \u00e9lite of the town. The \u00e9lite of\ntowns in the Philippines speak Spanish, and, as only one or two of our\nparty could at that time boast of more than a formal acquaintance with\nthe Castilian tongue, the exchange of ideas that evening between us\nand the Filipinos was of necessity not very rapid.\n\nThe necessity of easy communication between us was rendered somewhat\nless indispensable by the announcement of supper as soon as we were\nrested from our trip. When we had taken our places at the table a\nyoung Filipino about twenty-five years of age arose and gave a lengthy\ntoast to the recent union of the Philippines with the United States.\n\nBut as we Americans were unable to scale the dizzy heights of his\nclimaxes or sink to the depths of his pathos, we forewent the\npleasures of his oratory and turned our attention to the savory odor\nof lamb, chicken, and roast pig that came slyly stealing up our\nnostrils to send us nerve dispatches about the gastronomic delights of\nour not far distant future.\n\nAt last the toast was ended and the world-wide soup ushered in a long\ntrain of things good to eat, served in a style better fitted to the\ndelights of the appetite than to the formalities of dinners, for, as\nsoon as the pleasant task of one dish was completed by any one, the\nnext was served him at once regardless of the progress made by the\nothers at the table.\n\nThe last course was dulce. The new-comers to the Philippines will\nnot be long in making the acquaintance of this dish, and at all\nmeetings, both public and private, where eatables are served, it\nperforms an important part. It is anything sweet, and it may vary all\nthe way from an india-rubber-like black mixture of cocoanut milk and\ndirty sugar to a really toothsome and respectable confection. No\nmatter of what materials a dish is composed, just so long as it is\nsweet, it is dulce.\n\nAfter paying our respects to this last course, we arose from the table\nand entered a great rectangular room from the center of whose ceiling\nhung a large glass chandelier, a mass of shimmering crystals. In the\nchairs around the room were the wealth, the youth, and the beauty of\nthe town.\n\nThe first and also the last number of every Filipino dance of any\nformality is the \"rigodon.\" The dancers are arranged in a square, or\nquadrangle according to the number participating, and are then led\nthrough a tangled maze of figures that so utterly bewilders the novice\nthat he sinks into his chair at the end of the dance wondering how it\nall came to pass.\n\nWe Americans breathed a sigh of relief when the \"rigodon\" ended, and\nmustered fresh courage for social conquests in the waltz that was now\nbreathing forth from the trembling strings. My companion in the first\ndance had been the young lady by whose side I had sat at dinner. But\nit now became necessary to search for another, so I prudently waited\nto see how partners were chosen, and made no mistake when a few\nmoments later I faced one of the most luscious looking se\u00f1oritas on\nthe opposite side of the room and offered her my arm. My eyes must\nhave told the story that my lips could not utter in Spanish, for she\nsmiled upon me sweetly, arose, and put her hand upon my shoulder. My\narm encircled her waist and I began to waltz. Unfortunately my\ncompanion did not follow, but began to hop up and down in a manner\nmost distressing. Supposing the attack to be only temporary, I paused\nand, much to my relief, she soon showed signs of recovery; and in the\ncourse of time she came to a standstill looking up into my face in an\ninquiring sort of way, apparently wondering why St. Vitus had not paid\nhis respects to me also. A second attempt to follow the music met with\nresults similar to the first, and during the third attempt, which\nseemed to be trembling on the verge of a failure, St. Vitus let go my\ncompanion and seized me with such vigor that she, who was small even\nfor a Filipino, was gathered up bodily and taken around the room at\nsuch a pace that her toes touched the floor only at far distant\nintervals.\n\nAt this point my devotion to the shrine of Terpsichore ceased from\nforce of circumstances and I seated myself in one of the most\ncomfortable chairs in sight that I might carry out a previously formed\nplan to study the Filipino somewhat critically as he appears in\nsociety.\n\nThe first thing that impressed me as the dancers passed up and down\nthe room was the flash of diamonds. Nearly every woman in the room had\non a brooch that flashed the colors of the rainbow at every turn.\n\nAlmost all of them wore one or more rings that showed up brilliantly\nunder the chandelier. Many of the men too, especially the young men,\nwore gems that appeared to be exquisite. A closer inspection showed\nthat some of the gems had flaws and others were of a poor color, but\nno one would have denied that, taken as a whole, it was a really\nbeautiful display.\n\nThe dress of the ladies was richly colored. Many of their skirts were\nof silk covered with hand embroidered flowers, and their filmy pina\nwaists and broad collar pieces were rich with needle-work. They all\nwore a kind of heelless velvet slipper, very common as a dress shoe in\nthe Philippines, or high-heeled patent leather shoes with neatly\nfitting black stockings.\n\nThe men were dressed in white coats and white pantaloons or black\ncoats and white pantaloons. White shirts and collars, together with\nall sorts and styles of cravats and low-cut patent leather shoes with\nhighly colored socks completed their dress.\n\nIt was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money;\nthat they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a\ntable loaded with good things was a fact to which all of us were\nenthusiastic witnesses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VI. - A SKETCH OF LIFE IN THE PHILIPPINES.\n\n\nHouse-keeping in the Philippines presents some interesting phases. Our\nclub of American officials decided to run a mess, so we employed a\ncook and a house boy, then each of us provided himself with a personal\nservant, making a total of six servants for four men--it takes about\nthis proportion of servants to live in any sort of comfort in the\nPhilippines--and launched ourselves boldly upon the sea of domestic\neconomy. But there were shoals ahead of us, for the question of\nregulating servants is one of no small importance in the Philippines,\nand one of its most disadvantageous features is the long chain of\ndependents that usually attends it.\n\nWe gave the cooks so much a day with which to buy supplies in the\nlocal market, for our own table, making him render a daily list of\nexpenditures, and a fixed amount besides to purchase rice and fish for\nhimself and the other servants. Of course, if they wished to vary\ntheir diet and get chicken and fresh pork, which could be had at far\ndistant intervals, it was wholly a matter of their option, but the\nallowance was made on the basis of so much rice and fish a day for\neach. This allowance was about fifteen cents a day in Spanish coin per\nservant.\n\nThus far all was well. We had agreed to give the cook eight dollars a\nmonth in Spanish money, thinking that good wages would procure good\nservice, but the visions of affluence that floated before him on such\nfloods of wealth were so alluring that they drew him from the kitchen\nto the cooler veranda. In less than a week he had employed an\nassistant at four dollars a month; in less than another week that\nassistant had employed him an assistant at two dollars a month; in\nless than another week that assistant to the assistant had employed\nhim an assistant at the princely salary of fifty cents a month; and\nfrom fear that the chain of dependents would end only by our having\nthe whole Filipino race attached to our culinary force, we broke up\nhouse-keeping and went boarding again, choosing that as the less of\nthe two evils.\n\nOur house furnishings were almost wholly Philippine. The table ware\nand the food on the table came from the ends of the earth. The knives\nand forks were made in Germany, the plates were manufactured in\nEngland, the glass ware and table cloth, in the United States. The\noatmeal and flour came from the United States also. The butter came\nfrom Australia, the rice from China, the salt from Russia, and the\nother eatables from sources about as various as their separate names.\n\nSwitzerland furnished the condensed milk and Illinois the canned\ncream. Nearly all of the canned fruit bore labels from Spain.\n\nThus it can easily be seen that life in the Philippines, if lived\naccording to American ideals, is dependent upon a highly developed and\nhighly complex commerce. However, the difficulties of transportation\nand the restriction of large stocks of merchandise to Manila and some\nhalf a dozen other towns, make so great a difference between country\nlife and city life that a short comparison of the two will not be out\nof place, and life in Manila may well be taken as being fairly typical\nof the latter.\n\nLife in Manila is pleasant, but expensive. It is pleasant from the\nfact that it is not only the capital but also metropolis of the\narchipelago. Thus the combination of wealth and high official position\nhas given to Manila a society of the highest and most refined type.\n\nThe process of beautifying and improving the city which is constantly\ngoing on bids fair to give us at no distant day a city of which we may\nwell be proud.\n\nBut let him who intends living well in Manila on a small income bid\nfarewell at once to so idylic a dream, for it costs much to live well\nthere. In the city of Manila one can get almost anything he wishes,\nbut it must be paid for at the price it commands. Especially in the\ncase of eatables, this price is by no means small, because to the\nfirst cost of articles must in most cases be added the expense of\ndistant shipment from American, European, or Australian ports, and not\ninfrequently the cost of long refrigeration must also be taken into\nconsideration. But, expensive though it is, it is very pleasant to\nlive there and those who have once enjoyed it often wish again to\nquaff the cup of its delights.\n\nIn strong contrast to this pleasant life is the life of the quiet\nlittle hamlet away in the distant islands. Indeed, the Filipino from\nthe distant town, who by some good fortune has been to Manila, or, by\na coup de main, has studied in one of the Manila colleges, is looked\nup to in a true hero-worshiping attitude by all who either know him or\nhear of his fame. Life in such a place is one long state of harmless\ninactivity. Not a wave of trouble from the great outer world ever\ndisturbs its peaceful repose. One lounges forever in an air of\nindolent ease and extreme aversion to anything approaching what might\nbe called a respectable effort.\n\nOne arises in the morning about the time the sun's first rays silver\nthe top leaves of the cocoanut trees and then stirs around until nine\nor ten o'clock, when it is found expedient to avoid a further exposure\nto the sun. From then until about five o'clock in the afternoon it is\nbest to take things as they come, even though one of those things be a\nFilipino dinner. But then you may have your vehiclo attached to a\nyoung bull with a ring in his nose and go for a drive. If it is the\ndry season you will probably enjoy the drive unless you object to the\nfrequent clouds of dust swept along by the evening wind. If it is in\nthe rainy season your pleasure will depend to a considerable extent\nupon how wet you get; but, whether the season be wet or dry, your\npleasure will be regulated largely by the state of harmony existing\nbetween the driver and the bull.\n\nIn these quiet secluded nooks successive generations of Filipinos are\nborn, reared, grow old and die in an even chain of events broken only\nby the occasional erection of a new grass house on the identical spot\nwhere its predecessors have stood for ages. The son lives in the house\nof his father, cultivates the same few square feet of soil planted in\nedible roots, climbs the same cocoanut trees, follows the same winding\npath down to the stream, pounds rice in the same mortar and with the\nsame stick that his ancestors have used from time unremembered, and,\nin case of illness, curls up on a grass mat in a corner of the room\nuntil he dies or by some good fortune recovers. Beyond this narrow\nhorizon he never looks. So narrow and contracted is the life that the\nlanguages of two towns a few miles apart are so different that one\nwould scarcely recognize them as belonging to the same race of people.\n\nSuch are the two extremes of life in our new far Eastern provinces:\nthe one is active, progressive, and cosmopolitan; the other, inactive,\ndecadent, and narrow; but, whether one enjoys the first or endures the\nsecond, there comes to him after leaving a longing to lounge again in\ntropic airs and listen to the lullaby of the winds among the palms.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VII. - THE FILIPINO AT HOME.\n\n\nAs one enters a Filipino sitting-room for the first time, there is one\nfeature in the arrangement of the furniture that impresses itself upon\nhim at once, and it may be stated without fear of serious\ncontradiction that this same peculiar feature in its arrangement will\ncontinue to face him, as he enters different homes, about as certainly\nas he crosses the threshold.\n\nThe arrangement referred to is that of one large mirror, one settee,\nand some ten or a dozen chairs that appear to have had a certain\norderly affection for one another. The mirror is hung upon one of the\nlarge interior parts of the house about four feet above the floor. The\nwooden houses in the Philippines are built by setting large posts\nupright into the ground, extending into the air from twenty to thirty\nfeet. Cross timbers are fastened to these upright posts about eight or\nten feet above the ground and then not sawed off even with the posts,\nbut allowed to extend beyond them each way. The framework of the house\nis built upon these extending cross timbers, a style of building by\nwhich these large upright posts are left standing out on the inside of\nthe room from one to three feet from the walls. It is on that one of\nthese posts most nearly opposite the door that the mirror always finds\nits place. Immediately beneath the mirror is the settee; and the\nchairs are arranged in two parallel lines facing one another and at\nright angles with the ends of the settee. However odd this arrangement\nmay appear to one when he first enters a Filipino drawing-room, there\nare two things to be said in its favor. In the first place, it places\nyou face to face with the person with whom you are conversing so that\nyou can watch him,--a matter of no small moment in the Philippines. In\nthe next place, it enables you to give one of the young ladies a\nsheep's-eye in the mirror while the others present are left where\nMoses was in our much abused conundrum.\n\nThe size of the residence and the quality of its furnishings depends\nupon the wealth of the owner. But there is so vast a difference\nbetween the mode of life of the highest class and the tao, or lowest\nclass, that it is well to speak of them separately, and the great\nmiddle class of Filipinos can easily be imagined to occupy the\nintervening ground.\n\nThe rich Filipino's house is usually of wood built upon a wall of\nstone or brick from ten to fifteen feet high. The floors are kept\nhighly polished in his hallway, dressing-room, and bed-rooms. There\nare, of course, no fire-places in any of the rooms, but on some\noccasions something is needed to dry the rain-soaked atmosphere, for\neven in the dry season it has been seen to rain for five successive\ndays and nights without the cessation of a moment.\n\nA long chain of dependents is attached to the household of the rich\nFilipino. The master has his special body servant to be present at all\ntimes to do his master's bidding, in short, to be the visible\nmechanism of his master's volition. So, too, the lady of the house has\nher servant woman to do the slightest bidding of her ladyship. Then\nthere is the cook who is almost invariably a man, a house boy or two,\nand the coachman. These functionaries, with their assistants and\nassistants to the assistants, together with a servant or two for the\nexclusive service of the children, complete the economic household.\n\nSuch a family has an abundance of rice and wheat bread, also of\nchicken and fish with occasional fresh beef. They have also a good\ndeal of dulce. They regularly serve wine and frequently serve beer\non their tables.\n\nIn strong contrast with this mode of life is that of the tao. His\ndiet consists almost wholly of rice and small uncleaned fish boiled\ntogether. As a rule knife, fork, plate, and spoon find no place in his\nhousehold. The rice and fish are boiled in a pot and then allowed to\ncool in the same vessel or poured out to cool in a large earthen or\nwooden bowl. Then Mr. Tao together with Mrs. Tao and all the young\nTaos squat on their heels around the mixture and satisfy that\nintangible thing called the appetite. They do not use chop sticks as\nthe Chinese do, but the rice and fish are caught in a hollow formed by\nthe first three fingers of the right hand. The thumb is then placed\nbehind the mass. It is raised up and poised before the mouth, with a\nskill coming from the evolution of ages, when a contraction of the\nmuscles of the thumb throws the mass into the mouth with a skill that\nis marvelous to any but a Filipino. To judge from the most reliable\ninformation, the poorest class do not have an abundance of food,\nalthough it would seem that such a condition of things would be\nwell-nigh impossible. However, in a census of one hundred school\nchildren there were found six boys and four girls who declared that\nthey had never had enough to eat, and the native teacher stated that\nthis was probably true.\n\nThe wide gulf between the tao and the rich man is filled by the\ngreat middle class of Filipinos.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VIII. - VISIT TO A LEPER COLONY.\n\n\nNot far from our town was a leper colony and the first Saturday that\ncould be spared was set aside for a trip to the place. It happened\nthat none of the other Americans were at leisure on this particular\nmorning, but, rather then delay the trip or miss it altogether, the\nwriter, armed with a revolver, started out alone.\n\nThe road had been described so accurately by one who was supposed to\nknow it that it was deemed well-nigh impossible to miss the way. The\nmain highway was followed to the point where the by-path supposed to\nlead to the settlement turned off through some bamboo thickets and a\nlow tropical wood. This path led straight away towards the sea-coast\nwhere the houses of the colony were said to stand in a cocoanut grove\nby the beach.\n\nUpon arriving at the settlement, a very inhospitable reception was\nreceived from a mangy cur that growled and showed a very uninviting\nset of sharp, white teeth behind his snarling lips. The growling of\nthe dog had attracted the attention of an old man who, with age-bent\nback, was pounding rice in a mortar about fifty yards away. He turned\nslowly around and, upon seeing an intruder into the primitive quiet of\nthe place, gave a sharp, far-reaching call. The sound had scarcely\nrung through the grove when from about a dozen of the little grass\nhouses dotted here and there fifteen or twenty men armed with bolos\ncame out and gathered around the old man. A sense of my danger flashed\nupon me. Three miles from town and alone in a tropical jungle, I could\nbe almost instantly overcome by this band of bolo-men, and the only\nreport that would ever reach my people would be that I had\n\"disappeared.\" Of course, attack was by no means certain, but the\npotentiality of the situation was thrilling. A drawn revolver and the\ngleaming of its shining barrel had the effect of stopping the men, who\nseemed to be hesitating as to a course of action, until a somewhat\ndignified retreat was made to an open space in the rear from where a\nless dignified and a more hasty retreat began which did not stop short\nof Bacalod.\n\nEnough had been seen, however, even in this short visit, to give\nconvincing proof that the settlement visited was no colony of lepers;\nso, that afternoon two servant boys being taken as guides and\ninterpreters, another attempt was made to reach the goal desired.\n\nThis attempt was successful, and, after about two hours of walking, a\nlittle cluster of grass huts snugly hidden by the sea-coast came into\nview. As we approached, one would have thought it a gala-day. Some few\nchildren, apparently from six to thirteen years of age, almost wholly\nnude, were romping and playing in the open space around which the huts\nstood, and no one would ever have thought that any cloud so horrible\nas leprosy could hover over a place apparently so happy.\n\nBy the side of the path as we passed was a man and his wife setting\nout potato plants. His hands were so puffed and his fingers so short\nthat he could scarcely use them, but he was working along as best he\ncould. His wife's feet were so swollen and twisted that she walked\nonly with the greatest difficulty. We passed them by and entered the\nopen space above referred to.\n\nThe children now saw us, and those of them who could darted away like\nfrightened rabbits, each to his own burrow. An old man who was sitting\nin the warm afternoon sun on the little bamboo platform before his hut\nwas aroused from his lethargic repose by the scampering away of the\nchildren. He arose, trembling upon his tottering limbs, all drawn and\ntwisted, and hobbled away into his hut.\n\nThe children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at\nthe doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of\nthe settlement. In a few moments we were surrounded by a circle of\nhuman beings at once so repulsive and so pitiable that its graphic\nvividness can never be accurately portrayed.\n\nThe old man referred to above, having put on a pair of snow-white\npantaloons, appeared now at the doorway of his hut, followed a few\nmoments later by his wife who had evidently clothed herself in the\nbest raiment she had. At a call from the old man, all the men, women,\nand children in the settlement came out of their huts and stood in a\nline before us. The old man was spokesman and in his native visayan\ntongue made a heart-rending appeal for aid which we were powerless to\ngive. Attention was called to a leper woman, apparently about\ntwenty-five years of age, whose face had been attacked by the disease\nand whose appearance was truly pathetic. Upon her hip was a child\nabout a year and a half old and, strange to say, the child showed as\nyet no signs whatever of the disease.\n\nWhat an indissoluble enigma is life! Here in a little cluster of grass\nhuts in a secluded nook of a secluded island of an all but secluded\narchipelago was gathered together a little community of wretched\nnatives, driven by their loathsomeness from association with others\neven of the same half-savage race. Yet here, men and women loved and\nwere married, by mutual trust if not by law, and children were born of\nthe union to live forever under the unspeakable horror that\novershadowed the unfortunate parents. Love, hatred, sorrow, and\njoy--every passion that enters into the complex structure of the human\nheart even here, in this scene of sadness and despair, was playing\napparently as freely as where misfortune and disease had never crossed\nthe portals of life.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER IX. - A \"HIKE.\"\n\n\nWe were lounging lazily in our hammocks at Jimamaylan one evening in\nApril. Supper was just ended, and the soldiers in the post were\ncollected in groups here and there spinning yarns to pass away the\ntime, when a Filipino clad only in a loin cloth came down the street\nat a steadily swinging run and stopped in front of the sentry. He\nbrought the announcement that a band of ladrones had just burned a\nsugar mill and were advancing to sack a barrio about fifteen miles\naway.\n\nThe invitation of the commanding officer to go on a \"hike\" was eagerly\naccepted, and, in ten minutes after the message was given, the troops\nwere on the march followed by two adventurous pedagogues.\n\nDarkness was just closing in as we left the town, but a resplendent\ntropic moon soon made the night almost as brilliant as the day. The\ntrail we followed led over rough and rocky country. Sometimes for a\ndistance of a mile or more we passed over barren wastes of volcanic\nslag poured out in anger by some peak whose convulsions have long\nsince ceased. Again we would descend into a tropical jungle from the\ndense foliage of which the ladrones could have leaped at any moment,\nhad they known of our coming, and annihilated our little band. We\nforded rapid streams with the water at our breasts, and halted only\nonce in that rapid march of fifteen miles.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the town we met a man who was standing\nguard against a surprise by the ladrones. Nothing could well have been\nmuch more grotesque and nothing could much better illustrate the\nabsolutely primitive condition of the Filipinos in the interior of the\nislands than the appearance of this guard. A pair of knee pants, a\nconical grass hat, and a hemp shirt formed his entire apparel. A long\nflat wooden shield, a bolo, and a long bamboo spear with a sharp,\nflat, iron point, completed his equipment for battle.\n\nHere stood the first and the twentieth centuries side by side. The\nFilipino who had advanced only a stage beyond the condition of\nprimitive man with his knife, spear, and wooden shield, stood side by\nside with the American soldier, a representative of modern life with\nhis magazine rifle, his canteen, his knapsack,--with every article of\nhis clothing made to give him the highest possible efficiency as the\nunit of a military organization.\n\nA few yards farther on we met another guard equipped similarly to the\nfirst. Upon reaching the town, news had just been received that a\ndetachment of troops from another post had intercepted the ladrones\nand fought a skirmish with them. The ladrones had escaped and we set\nout in pursuit of them on a chase wilder than a Quixotic dream. We\nwound our way into the mountains behind the town, inquiring at every\ngrass hut we passed whether the band of ladrones had passed that way,\nbut only once was even a trace of them found. Then it was learned that\nat a certain place they had separated into groups of three or four and\ngone glimmering through the dream of things that were. This place was\nin a secluded nook of the mountains where in years gone by some\nadventurous Spaniard had erected a primitive water mill to grind his\nsugar-cane. We had now marched about twenty miles and the feet of the\npedagogues were a mass of blisters. They had reached the point where\nthat form of military maneuvering called \"hiking\" ceased to possess\nany alluring charms. So a native was persuaded to come out of his lone\nmountain hut and hitch up his carabao and cart. He was then made to\nget on the carabao's back, while the aforesaid pedagogues lay down on\nthe sugar-cane pulp that had been put into the body of the cart, and\nthe driver was instructed to start for the post we had left hours\nbefore, and not to stop until he got there. Being uncertain but that\nsome of the ladrones would learn of our having left the body of troops\nand would try the metal of our steel, we at first agreed that neither\nof us should go to sleep, but it was later decided that probably the\ndriver had no greater desire to cross the Styx than his passengers had\nand that in case of danger he would awaken us, so both took a revolver\nin each hand, stretched out supinely and went to sleep.\n\nSuch a sleep! The rough jolting of the cart over an almost impassable\nroad was never enough to break the spell of slumber. When we awoke the\nblazing tropic sun was past the midday mark of morning, shining full\ninto our unprotected and well-nigh blistered faces.\n\nA pack of dogs were heralding our approach to a little village at the\nfoot of the mountains where ponies were procured to take us back to\nthe post.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he insists, \"have stood the test of ages; and the plant\nevery where retained its name and credit: and one of our good\nherbarists, who had seen a wonderful case of a swoln spleen, so big, and\nhard as to be felt with terror, brought back to a state of nature by it\"\n\n(p. 37). The greatest portion of Hill's concluding section combines\nadvertisement for the powder medicine he was himself manufacturing at a\nhandsome profit together with a protest against competing apothecaries:\n\"An intelligent person was directed to go to the medicinal herb shops in\nthe several markets, and buy some of this Spleen-wort; the name was\nwritten, and shewn to every one; every shop received his money, and\nalmost every one sold a different plant, under the name of this: but\nwhat is very striking, not one of them the right\" (p. 42).\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis did not cease to be printed after Hill's in\n1766, but continued to issue from the presses into the nineteenth\ncentury. A good example of this is the tome by John Reid, physician to\nthe Finsbury Dispensary in London, Essays on Insanity, Hypochondriasis\nand Other Nervous Affections (1816), which summarizes theories of the\nmalady. A bibliographical study of such works would probably reveal\na larger number of titles in the nineteenth century than in the previous\none, but by this time the nature and definition of hypochondria had\nchanged significantly.\n\nIf John Hill's volume is not an important contribution in the history of\nmedicine, it is a lucid and brief exposition of many of the best ideas\nthat had been thought and written on the hyp, with the exception of his\nuninhibited prescribing of herbal medicines as cure-alls. An\nunderstanding of this disease is essential for readers of neoclassical\nEnglish literature, especially when we reflect upon the fact that some\nof the best literature of the period was composed by writers whom it\nafflicted. It is perhaps not without significance that the greatest poet\nof the Augustan age, Alexander Pope, thought it necessary as he lay on\nhis deathbed in May 1744 to exclaim with his last breath, \"I never was\nhippish in my whole life.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. I. - The NATURE of the DISORDER.\n\n\nTo call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and cruel. It\nis a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by thickened\nand distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver, and other\nparts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick scarce knows\none more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\n\nThe blood is a mixture of many fluids, which, in a state of health, are\nso combined, that the whole passes freely through its appointed vessels;\nbut if by the loss of the thinner parts, the rest becomes too gross to\nbe thus carried through, it will stop where the circulation has least\npower; and having thus stopped it will accumulate; heaping by degrees\nobstruction on obstruction.\n\nHealth and chearfulness, and the quiet exercise of mind, depend upon a\nperfect circulation: is it a wonder then, when this becomes impeded the\nbody looses of its health, and the temper of its sprightliness? to be\notherwise would be the miracle; and he inhumanly insults the afflicted,\nwho calls all this a voluntary frowardness. Its slightest state brings\nwith it sickness, anguish and oppression; and innumerable ills follow\nits advancing steps, unless prevented by timely care; till life itself\ngrows burthensome.\n\nThe disease was common in antient Greece; and her physicians understood\nit, better than those perhaps of later times, in any other country; who\nthough happy in many advantages these fathers of the science could not\nhave, yet want the great assistance of frequent watching it in all its\nstages.\n\nThose venerable writers have delivered its nature, and its cure: in the\nfirst every thing now shews they were right; and what they have said as\nto the latter will be found equally true and certain. This, so far as\npresent experience has confirmed it, and no farther, will be here laid\nbefore the afflicted in a few plain words.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. II. - Persons Subject to it.\n\n\nFatigue of mind, and great exertion of its powers often give birth to\nthis disease; and always tend to encrease it. The finer spirits are\nwasted by the labour of the brain: the Philosopher rises from his study\nmore exhausted than the Peasant leaves his drudgery; without the benefit\nthat he has from exercise. Greatness of mind, and steady virtue;\ndetermined resolution, and manly firmness, when put in action, and\nintent upon their object, all also lead to it: perhaps whatever tends to\nthe ennobling of the soul has equal share in bringing on this weakness\nof the body.\n\nFrom this we may learn easily who are the men most subject to it; the\ngrave and studious, those of a sedate temper and enlarged understanding,\nthe learned and wise, the virtuous and the valiant: those whom it were\nthe interest of the world to wish were free from this and every other\nillness; and who perhaps, except for this alloy, would have too large a\nportion of human happiness.\n\nThough these are most, it is not these alone, who are subject to it.\n\nThere are countries where it is endemial, and in other places some have\nthe seeds of it in their constitution; and in some it takes rise from\naccidents. In these last it is the easiest of cure; and in the first\nmost difficult.\n\nBeside the Greeks already named, the Jews of old time were heavily\nafflicted with this disease; and in their descendants to this day it is\noften constitutional: the Spaniards have it almost to a man; and so have\nthe American Indians. Perhaps the character of these several nations may\nbe connected with it. The steady honour, and firm valour of the\nSpaniard, very like that of the ancient Doric nation, who followed the\nflute not the trumpet to the field; and met the enemy, not with shouts\nand fury, but with a determined virtue: it is the temper of the\nHypochondriac to be slow, but unmoveably resolved: the Jew has shewn\nthis mistakenly, but almost miraculously; and the poor Indian, untaught\nas he is, faces all peril with composure, and sings his death-song with\nan unalter'd countenance.\n\nAmong particular persons the most inquiring and contemplative are those\nwho suffer oftenest by this disease; and of all degrees of men I think\nthe clergy. I do not mean the hunting, shooting, drinking clergy, who\nbear the tables of the great; but the retir'd and conscientious; such as\nattend in midnight silence to their duty; and seek in their own cool\nbreasts, or wheresoever else they may be found, new admonitions for an\nage plunged in new vices. To this disease we owe the irreparable loss of\nDr. YOUNG; and the present danger of many other the best and most\nimproved amongst us. May what is here to be proposed assist in their\npreservation!\n\nThe Geometrician or the learned Philosopher of whatever denomination,\nwhose course of study fixes his eye for ever on one object, his mind\nintensely and continually employed upon one thought, should be warned\nalso that he is in danger; or if he find himself already afflicted, he\nshould be told that the same course of life, which brought it on, will,\nwithout due care, encrease it to the most dreaded violence.\n\nThe middle period of life is that in which there is the greatest danger\nof an attack from this disease; and the latter end of autumn, when the\nsummer heats have a little time been over, is the season when in our\nclimate its first assaults are most to be expected. The same time of the\nyear always increases the disorder in those who have been before\nafflicted with it; and it is a truth must be confessed, that from its\nfirst attack the patient grows continually, though slowly, worse; unless\na careful regimen prevent it.\n\nThe constitutions most liable to this obstruction are the lean, and dark\ncomplexioned; the grave and sedentary. Let such watch the first\nsymptoms; and obviate, (as they may with ease) that which it will be\nmuch more difficult to remove.\n\nIt is happy a disease, wherein the patient must do a great deal for\nhimself, falls, for the most part, upon those who have the powers of\nreason strongest. Let them only be aware of this, that the distemper\nnaturally disposes them to inactivity; and reason will have no use\nunless accompanied with resolution to enforce it.\n\nThough the physician can do something toward the cure, much more depends\nupon the patient; and here his constancy of mind will be employed most\nhappily. No one is better qualified to judge on a fair hearing what\ncourse is the most fit; and having made that choice, he must with\npatience wait its good effects. Diseases that come on slowly must have\ntime for curing; an attention to the first appearances of the disorder\nwill be always happiest; because when least established it is easiest\noverthrown: but when that happy period has been neglected, he must wait\nthe effects of such a course as will dilute and melt the obstructing\nmatter gradually; for till that be done it is not only vain, but\nsometimes dangerous, to attempt its expulsion from the body.\n\nThe blood easily separates itself into the grosser and the thinner\nparts: we see this in bleeding; and from the toughness of the red cake\nmay guess how very difficult it will be to dissolve a substance of like\nfirmness in the vessels of the body. That it can thus become thickened\nwithin the body, a Pleurisy shews us too evidently: in that case it is\nbrought on suddenly, and with inflammation; in this other, slowly and\nwithout; and here, even before it forms the obstruction, can bring on\nmany mischiefs. Various causes can produce the same effect, but that in\nall cases operates most durably, which operates most slowly. The watery\npart of the blood is its mild part; in the remaining gross matter of it,\nare acrid salts and burning oils, and these, when destitute of that\nhappy dilution nature gives them in a healthy body, are capable of doing\ngreat mischief to the tender vessels in which they are kept stagnant.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. III. - The SYMPTOMS of the DISORDER.\n\n\nThe first and lightest of the signs that shew this illness are a lowness\nof spirits, and inaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love\nof solitude and a habit of thinking, even on trifling subjects, with too\nmuch steadiness. A very little help may combat these: but if that\nindolence which is indeed a part of the disorder, will neglect them;\nworse must be expected soon to follow.\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness, weight, and oppression in the body,\na want of appetite, or, what is worse, an appetite without digestion;\nfor these are the conditions of different states of the disease, a\nfullness and a difficulty of breathing after meals, a straitness of the\nbreast, pains and flatulencies in the bowels, and an unaptness to\ndischarge their contents.\n\nThe pulse becomes low, weak, and unequal; and there are frequent\npalpitations of the heart, a little dark-coloured urine is voided at\nsome times; and a flood of colourless and insipid at others; relieving\nfor a moment, but increasing the distemper: there is in some cases also\na continual teazing cough, with a choaking stoppage in the throat at\ntimes; then heartburn, sickness, hardness of the belly, and a costive\nhabit, or a tormenting and vain irritation.\n\nThe lips turn pale, the eyes loose their brightness and by degrees the\nwhite grows as it were greenish, the gums want their due firmness, with\ntheir proper colour; and an unpleasing foulness grows upon the teeth:\nthe inside of the mouth is pale and furred, and the throat dry and\nhusky: the colour of the skin is pale (though there are periods when the\nface is florid) and as the obstruction gathers ground, and more affects\nthe liver, the whole body becomes yellow, tawny, greenish, and at length\nof that deep and dusky hue, to which men of swift imagination have given\nthe name of blackness.\n\nThese symptoms do not all appear in any one period of the disease, or in\none case, but at one time or other all of them, as well as those which\nfollow: the flesh becomes cold to the touch, though the patient does not\nhimself perceive it; the limbs grow numbed and torpid, the breathing\ndull and slow, and the voice hollow; and usually the appetite in this\nperiod declines, and comes almost to nothing: night sweats come on,\nblack swellings appear on the veins, the flesh wastes and the breast\nbecomes flat and hollow: the mouth is full of a thin spittle, the head\nis dizzy and confus'd, and sometimes there is an unconquerable numbness\nin the organs of speech.\n\nI have known the temporary silence that follows upon this last symptom\nbecome a jest to the common herd; and the unhappy patient, instead of\ncompassion and assistance, receive the reproof of sullenness, from those\nwho should have known and acted better.\n\nAbout twenty years ago I met on a visit at Catthorpe in Leicestershire a\nyoung gentleman of distinguished learning and abilities, who at certain\ntimes was speechless. The vulgar thought it a pretence: and a jocose\nlady, where he was at tea with company, putting him as she said to a\ntrial, poured out a dish very strong and without sugar. He drank it and\nreturned the cup with a bow of great reserve, and his eye bent on the\nground: she then filled the cup with sugar, and pouring weak tea on it,\nsent it him: he drank that too, looked at her steadily, and blushed for\nher. The lady declared the man was dumb; the rest thought him perverse,\nand obstinate; but a constant and steady perseverance in an easy method\ncured him.\n\nAll these are miseries which the disease, while it retains its natural\nform, can bring upon the patient; and thus he will in time be worn out,\nand led miserably, though slowly, to the grave. Let him not indulge his\ninactivity so far as to give way to this, because it is represented as\nfar off; the disease may suddenly and frightfully change its nature; and\nswifter evils follow.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. IV. - The DANGER.\n\n\nWe have done with the obstruction considered in itself; but this, though\noften unsurmountable by art, at least by the methods now in use, will be\nsometimes broken through at once by nature, or by accidents; and bring\non fatal evils. These are strictly different diseases, and are no\notherway concerned here, than as the consequences of that of which we\nare treating.\n\nThe thick and glutinous blood which has so long stagnated in the spleen,\nwill have in that time altered its nature, and acquired a very great\ndegree of acrimony: while it lies dormant, this does no more mischiefs,\nthan those named already; but when violent exercise, a fit of outrageous\nanger, or any thing else that suddenly shocks and disturbs the frame,\nputs it in motion, it melts at once into a kind of liquid putrefaction.\n\nBeing now thin, it mixes itself readily with the blood again, and brings\non putrid fevers; destroys the substance of the spleen itself, or being\nthrown upon some other of the viscera, corrodes them, and leads on this\nway a swift and miserable death. If it fall upon the liver, its tender\npulpy substance is soon destroyed, jaundices beyond the help of art\nfirst follow, then dropsies and all their train of misery; if on lungs,\nconsumptions; if on the brain, convulsions, epilepsy, palsy, apoplexy;\nif on the surface, leprosy.\n\nThe intention of cure is to melt this coagulation softly, not to break\nit violently; and then to give it a very gentle passage through the\nbowels. There is no safe way for it to take but that; and even that when\nurged too far may bring on fatal dysenteries.\n\nLet none wonder at the sudden devastation which sometimes arises from\nthis long stagnant matter, when liquified too hastily: how long, how\nmany years the impacted matter will continue quiet in a schirrous tumour\nof the breast; but being once put in motion, whether from accident, or\nin the course of nature, what can describe; or what can stop its\nhavock!\n\nInstances of the other are too frequent. A nobleman the other day died\nparalytick: dissection shewed a spleen consumed by an abscess, formed\nfrom the dissolved matter of such an obstruction: and 'tis scarce longer\nsince, a learned gentleman, who had been several years lost to his\nfriends, by the extreams of a Hypochondriacal disorder, seem'd gradually\nwithout assistance to recover: but the lungs suffered while the spleen\nwas freed; and he died very soon of what is called a galloping\nconsumption.\n\nWhen the obstruction is great and of long continuance, if it be thus\nhastily moved, the consequence is, equally, a sudden and a miserable\ndeath, whether, like the matter of a cancer, it remains in its place; or\nlike that of a bad small pox, be thrown upon some other vital part.\n\nLet not the patient be too much alarmed; this is laid down to caution,\nnot to terrify him: it is fit he should know his danger, and attend to\nit; for the prevention is easy; and the cure, even of the most advanced\nstages, when undertaken by gentle means, is not at all impracticable: to\nassist the physician, let him look into himself, and recollect the\nsource of his complaint. This he may judge of from the following\nnotices.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. V. - The Causes of the HYPOCHONDRIASIS.\n\n\nThe obstruction which forms this disease, may take its origin from\ndifferent accidents: a fever ill cured has often caused it; or the\npiles, which had been used to discharge largely, ceasing; a marshy soil,\npoisoned with stagnant water, has given it to some persons; and altho'\nindolence and inactivity are oftenest at the root, yet it has arisen\nfrom too great exercise.\n\nReal grief has often brought it on; and even love, for sometimes that is\nreal. Study and fixed attention of the mind have been accused before;\nand add to these the stooping posture of the body, which most men use,\nthough none should use it, in writing and in reading. This has\ncontributed too much to it; but of all other things night studies are\nthe most destructive. The steady stillness, and dusky habit of all\nnature in those hours, enforce, encourage, and support that settled\ngloom, which rises from fixt thought; and sinks the body to the grave;\neven while it carries up the mind to heaven. He who would have his lamp\n        At midnight hour\n  Be seen in some high lonely tower,\nwill waste the flame of this unheeded life: and while he labours to\nunsphere the spirit of Plato will let loose his own.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VI. - The Cure of the HYPOCHONDRIASIS.\n\n\nLet him who would escape the mischiefs of an obstructed spleen, avoid\nthe things here named: and let him who suffers from the malady,\nendeavour to remember to which of them it has been owing; for half the\nhope depends upon that knowledge.\n\nNature has sometimes made a cure herself, and we should watch her ways;\nfor art never is so right as when it imitates her: sometimes the\npatient's own resolution has set him free. This is always in his power,\nand at all times will do wonders.\n\nThe bleeding of the piles, from nature's single efforts, has at once\ncured a miserable man; where their cessation was the cause of the\ndisorder. A leprosy has appeared upon the skin, and all the symptoms of\nthe former sickness vanished. This among the Jews happened often: both\ndiseases we know were common among them: and I have here seen something\nvery like it: Water-Dock has thrown out scorbutic eruptions, and all the\nformer symptoms of an Hypochondriacal disorder have disappeared:\nreturning indeed when these were unadvisedly struck in; but keeping off\nentirely when they were better treated. A natural purging unsuppressed\nhas sometimes done the same good office: but this is hazardous.\n\nIt is easy to be directed from such instances; only let us take the\nwhole along with us. Bleeding would have answered nature's purpose, if\nshe could not have opened of herself the h\u00e6morrhoidal vessels; but he\nwho should give medicines for that purpose, might destroy his patient by\ntoo great disturbance. If a natural looseness may perform the cure, so\nmay an artificial; when the original source of the disorder points that\nway. But these are helps that take place only in particular cases.\n\nThe general and universal method of cure must be by some mild and gently\nresolving medicine, under the influence of which the obstructing matter\nmay be voided that, or some other way with safety. The best season to\nundertake this is the autumn, but even here there must be caution.\n\nIn the first place, no strong evacuating remedy must be given; for that,\nby carrying off the thinner parts of the juices, will tend to thicken\nthe remainder; and certainly encrease the distemper. No acrid medicine\nmust be directed, for that may act too hastily, dissolve the impacted\nmatter at once, and let it loose, to the destruction of the sufferer; no\nantimonial, no mercurial, no martial preparation must be taken; in\nshort, no chymistry: nature is the shop that heaven has set before us,\nand we must seek our medicine there. The venerable ancients, who knew\nnot this new art, will lead us in the search; and (faithful relators as\nthey are of truth) will tell us whence we may deduce our hope; and what\nwe are to fear.\n\nBut prior to the course of any medicine, and as an essential to any good\nhope from it, the patient must prescribe himself a proper course of\nlife, and a well chosen diet: let us assist him in his choice; and speak\nof this first, as it comes first in order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VI. - Rules of Life for Hypochondriac Persons.\n\n\nAir and exercise, as they are the best preservers of health, and\ngreatest assistants in the cure of all long continued diseases, will\nhave their full effect in this; but there requires some caution in the\nchoice, and management of them. It is common to think the air of high\ngrounds best; but experience near home shews otherwise: the\nHypochondriac patient is always worse at Highgate even than in London.\n\nThe air he breathes should be temperate; not exposed to the utmost\nviolences of heat and cold, and the swift changes from one to the\nother; which are most felt on those high grounds. The side of a hill is\nthe best place for him: and though wet grounds are hurtful; yet let\nthere be the shade of trees, to tempt him often to a walk; and soften by\ntheir exhalation the over dryness of the air.\n\nThe exercise he takes should be frequent; but not violent. Motion\npreserves the firmness of the parts, and elasticity of the vessels; it\nprevents that aggregation of thick humours which he is most to fear. A\nsedentary life always produces weakness, and that mischief always\nfollows: weak eyes are gummy, weak lungs are clogged with phlegm, and\nweak bowels waste themselves in vapid diarrhoeas.\n\nLet him invite himself abroad, and let his friends invite him by every\ninnocent inducement. For me, I should advise above all other things the\nstudy of nature. Let him begin with plants: he will here find a\ncontinual pleasure, and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful\nthings; even of the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to\nwalk; and every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket,\nwill afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually\nin the air, and continually to change the nature and quality of the air,\nby visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the lawn, the\nheath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be abroad; and the\nunceasing variety of the subjects of his observation, will prevent his\nwalking hastily: he will pursue his studies in the air; and that\ncontemplative turn of mind, which in his closet threatened his\ndestruction, will thus become the great means of his recovery.\n\nIf the mind tire upon this, from the repeated use, another of nature's\nkingdoms opens itself at once upon him; the plant he is weary of\nobserving, feeds some insect he may examine; nor is there a stone that\nlies before his foot, but may afford instruction and amusement.\n\nEven what the vulgar call the most abject things will shew a wonderful\nutility; and lead the mind, in pious contemplation higher than the\nstars. The poorest moss that is trampled under foot, has its important\nuses: is it at the bottom of a wood we find it? why there it shelters\nthe fallen seeds; hides them from birds, and covers them from frost;\nand thus becomes the foster father of another forest! creeps it along\nthe surface of a rock? even there its good is infinite! its small roots\nrun into the stone, and the rains make their way after them; the moss\nhaving lived its time dies; it rots and with the mouldered fragments of\nthe stone forms earth; wherein, after a few successions, useful plants\nmay grow, and feed more useful cattle!\n\nIs there a weed more humble in its aspect, more trampled on, or more\ndespised than knot grass! no art can get the better of its growth, no\nlabour can destroy it; 'twere pity if they could, for the thing lives\nwhere nothing would of use to us; and its large and most wonderfully\nabundant seeds, feed in hard winters, half the birds of Heaven.\n\nWhat the weak moss performs upon the rock the loathed toadstool brings\nabout in timber: is an oak dead where man's eye will not find it? this\nfungus roots itself upon the bark, and rots the wood beneath it; hither\nthe beetle creeps for shelter, and for sustenance; him the woodpecker\nfollows as his prey; and while he tears the tree in search of him, he\nscatters it about the ground; which it manures.\n\nNor is it the beetle alone that thus insinuates itself into the\nsubstance of the vegetable tribe: the tender aphide, whom a touch\ndestroys, burrows between the two skins of a leaf, for shelter from his\nwinged enemies; tracing, with more than Dedal\u00e6an art, his various\nmeanders; and veining the green surface with these white lines more\nbeautifully than the best \u00c6gyptian marble.\n\n'Twere endless to proceed; nor is it needful: one object will not fail\nto lead on to another, and every where the goodness of his God will\nshine before him even in what are thought the vilest things; his\ngreatness in the lead of them.\n\nLet him pursue these thoughts, and seek abroad the objects and the\ninstigations to them: but let him in these and all other excursions\navoid equally the dews of early morning, and of evening.\n\nThe more than usual exercise of this prescription will dispose him to\nmore than customary sleep, let him indulge it freely; so far from\nhurting, it will help his cure.\n\nLet him avoid all excesses: drink need scarce be named, for we are\nwriting to men of better and of nobler minds, than can be tempted to\nthat humiliating vice. Those who in this disorder have too great an\nappetite, must not indulge it; much eaten was never well digested: but\nof all excesses the most fatal in this case is that of venery. It is the\nexcess we speak of.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VII. - The proper DIET.\n\n\nIn the first place acids must be avoided carefully; and all things that\nare in a state of fermentation, for they will breed acidity. Provisions\nhardened by salting never should be tasted; much less those cured by\nsmoaking, and by salting. Bacon is indigestible in an Hypochondriac\nstomach; and hams, impregnated as is now the custom, with acid fumes\nfrom the wood fires over which they are hung, have that additional\nmischief.\n\nMilk ought to be a great article in the diet: and even in this there\nshould be choice. The milk of grass-fed cows has its true quality: no\nother. There are a multitude of ways in which this may be made a part\nboth of our foods and drinks, and they should all be used.\n\nThe great and general caution is that the diet be at all times of a kind\nloosening and gently stimulating; light but not acrid. Veal, lamb,\nfowls, lobsters, crabs, craw-fish, fresh water fish and mutton broth,\nwith plenty of boiled vegetables, are always right; and give enough\nvariety.\n\nRaw vegetables are all bad: sour wines, old cheese, and bottled beer are\nthings never to be once tasted. Indeed much wine is wrong, be it of what\nkind soever. It is the first of cordials; and as such I would have it\ntaken in this disease when it is wanted: plainly as a medicine, rather\nthan a part of diet. Malt liquor carefully chosen is certainly the best\ndrink. This must be neither new, nor tending to sourness; perfectly\nclear, and of a moderate strength: it is the native liquor of our\ncountry, and the most healthful.\n\nToo much tea weakens; and even sugar is in this disorder hurtful: but\nhoney may supply its place in most things; and this is not only harmless\nbut medicinal; a very powerful dissolvent of impacted humours, and a\ngreat deobstruent.\n\nWhat wine is drank should be of some of the sweet kinds. Old Hock has\nbeen found on enquiry to yield more than ten times the acid of the sweet\nwines; and in red Port, at least in what we are content to call so,\nthere is an astringent quality, that is most mischievous in these cases:\nit is said there is often alum in it: how pregnant with mischief that\nmust be to persons whose bowels require to be kept open, is most\nevident. Summer fruits perfectly ripe are not only harmless but\nmedicinal; but if eaten unripe they will be very prejudicial. A light\nsupper, which will leave an appetite for a milk breakfast, is always\nright; this will not let the stomach be ravenous for dinner, as it is\napt to be in those who make that their only meal.\n\nOne caution more must be given, and it may seem a strange one: it is\nthat the patient attend regularly to his hours of eating. We have to do\nwith men for the most part whose soul is the great object of their\nregard; but let them not forget they have a body.\n\nThe late Dr. STUKELY has told me, that one day by appointment visiting\nSir ISAAC NEWTON, the servant told him, he was in his study. No one was\npermitted to disturb him there; but as it was near dinner time, the\nvisitor sat down to wait for him. After a time dinner was brought in; a\nboil'd chicken under a cover. An hour pass'd, and Sir ISAAC did not\nappear. The doctor eat the fowl, and covering up the empty dish, bad\nthem dress their master another. Before that was ready, the great man\ncame down; he apologiz'd for his delay, and added, \"give me but leave to\ntake my short dinner, and I shall be at your service; I am fatigued and\nfaint.\" Saying this, he lifted up the cover; and without any emotion,\nturned about to STUKELY with a smile; \"See says he, what we studious\npeople are, I forgot I had din'd.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VIII. - The MEDICINE.\n\n\n'Tis the ill fate of this disease, more than of all others to be\nmisunderstood at first, and thence neglected; till the physician shakes\nhis head at a few first questions. None steals so fatally upon the\nsufferer: its advances are by very slow degrees; but every day it grows\nmore difficult of cure.\n\nThat this obstruction in the spleen is the true malady, the cases\nrelated by the antients, present observation, and the unerring\ntestimonies of dissections leave no room to doubt. Being understood, the\npath is open where to seek a remedy: and our best guides in this, as in\nthe former instance, will be those venerable Greeks; who saw a thousand\nof these cases, where we see one; and with less than half our theory,\ncured twice as many patients.\n\nOne established doctrine holds place in all these writers; that whatever\nby a hasty fermentation dissolves the impacted matter of the\nobstruction, and sends it in that state into the blood, does incredible\nmischief: but that whatever medicine softens it by slow degrees, and, as\nit melts, delivers it to the bowels without disturbance; will cure with\nequal certainty and safety.\n\nFor this good purpose, they knew and tried a multitude of herbs; but in\nthe end they fixed on one: and on their repeated trials of this, they\nbanished all the rest. This stood alone for the cure of the disease; and\nfrom its virtue received the name of SPLEEN-WORT. O wise and happy\nGreeks! authors of knowledge and perpetuators of it! With them the very\nname they gave a plant declared its virtues: with us, a writer calls a\nplant from some friend; that the good gardener who receives the honour,\nmay call another by his name who gave it. We now add the term smooth\nto this herb, to distinguish it from another, called by the same general\nterm, though not much resembling it.\n\nThe virtues of this smooth Spleen-wort have flood the test of ages; and\nthe plant every where retained its name and credit: and one of our good\nherbalists, who had seen a wonderful case of a swoln spleen, so big, and\nhard as to be felt with terror, brought back to a state of nature by it;\nand all the miserable symptoms vanish; thought Spleen-wort not enough\nexpressive of its excellence; but stamp'd on it the name of MILT-WASTE.\n\nIn the Greek Islands now, the use of it is known to every one; and even\nthe lazy monks who take it, are no longer splenetic. In the west of\nEngland, the rocks are stripped of it with diligence; and every old woman\ntells you how charming that leaf is for bookish men: in Russia they use\na plant of this kind in their malt liquor: it came into fashion there\nfor the cure of this disease; which from its constant use is scarce\nknown any longer; and they suppose 'tis added to their liquor for a\nflavour.\n\nThe ancients held it in a kind of veneration; and used what has been\ncalled a superstition in the gathering it. It was to be taken up with a\nsharp knife, without violence, and laid upon the clean linen: no time\nbut the still darkness of the night was proper, and even the moon was\nnot to shine upon it. I know they have been ridiculed for this; for\nnothing is so vain as learned ignorance: but let me be permitted once to\nvindicate them.\n\nThe plant has leaves that can close in their sides; and their under part\nis covered thick with a yellow powder, consisting of the seeds, and seed\nvessels: in these they knew the virtue most resided: this was the golden\ndust they held so valuable; and this they knew they could not be too\ncautious to preserve. They were not ignorant of the sleep of plants; a\nmatter lately spoken of by some, as if a new discovery; and being\nsensible that light, a dry air, an expanded leaf, and a tempestuous\nseason, were the means of losing this fine dust; and knowing also that\ndarkness alone brought on that closing of the leaf which thence has\nbeen called sleep; and which helped to defend and to secure it, they\ntherefore took such time, and used such means as could best preserve the\nplant entire; and even save what might be scattered from it.--And now\nwhere is their superstition?\n\nFrom this plant thus collected they prepared a medicine, which in a\ncourse of forty days scarce ever failed to make a perfect cure.\n\nWe have the plant wild with us; and till the fashion of rough chemical\npreparations took off our attention from these gentler remedies, it was\nin frequent use and great repute. I trust it will be so again: and many\nthank me for restoring it to notice.\n\nSpleen-wort gives out its virtues freely in a tincture; and a small dose\nof this, mixing readily with the blood and juices, gradually dissolves\nthe obstruction; and by a little at a time delivers its contents to be\nthrown off without pain, from the bowels. Let this be done while the\nviscera are yet sound and the cure is perfect. More than the forty days\nof the Greek method is scarce ever required; much oftener two thirds of\nthat time suffice; and every day, from the first dose of it, the patient\nfeels the happy change that is growing in his constitution. His food no\nmore turns putrid on his stomach, but yields its healthful nourishment.\n\nThe swelling after meals therefore vanishes; and with that goes the\nlowness, and anxiety, the difficult breath, and the distracting cholick:\nhe can bear the approach of rainy weather without pain; he finds himself\nmore apt for motion, and ready to take that exercise which is to be\nassistant in his cure; life seems no longer burthensome. His bowels get\ninto the natural condition of health, and perform their office once at\nleast a day; better if a little more: the dull and dead colour of his\nskin goes off, his lips grow red again, and every sign of health\nreturns.\n\nLet him who takes the medicine, say whether any thing here be\nexaggerated. Let him, if he pleases to give himself the trouble, talk\nover with me, or write to me, this gradual decrease of his complaints,\nas he proceeds in his cure. My uncertain state of health does not\npermit me to practise physic in the usual way, but I am very desirous to\ndo what good I can, and shall never refuse my advice, such as it may be,\nto any person rich or poor, in whatever manner he may apply for it. I\nshall refer him to no apothecary, whose bills require he should be\ndrenched with potions; but tell him, in this as in all other cases,\nwhere to find some simple herb; which he may if he please prepare\nhimself; or if he had rather spare that trouble, may have it so prepared\nfrom me.\n\nWith regard to Spleen-wort, no method of using it is more effectual than\nsimply taking it in powder; the only advantage of a tincture, is that a\nproper dose may be given, and yet the stomach not be loaded with so\nlarge a quantity: it is an easier and pleasanter method, and nothing\nmore.\n\nIf any person choose to take it in the other way, I should still wish\nhim once at least to apply to me; that he may be assured what he is\nabout to take is the right plant. Abuses in medicines are at this time\nvery great, and in no instance worse than what relates to herbs. The\nbest of our physicians have complained upon this head with warmth, but\nwithout redress: they know the virtues and the value of many of our\nnative plants, but dread to prescribe them; lest some wrong thing should\nbe administered in their place; perhaps inefficacious, perhaps\nmischievous, nay it may be fatal. The few simple things I direct are\nalways before me; and it will at all times be a pleasure to me, in this\nand any other instance, to see whether what any person is about to take\nbe right. I have great obligations to the public, and this is the best\nreturn that I know how to make.\n\nTo see the need of such a caution, hear a transaction but of yesterday!\n\nAn intelligent person was directed to go to the medicinal herb shops in\nthe several markets, and buy some of this Spleen-wort; the name was\nwritten, and shewn to every one; every shop received his money, and\nalmost every one sold a different plant, under the name of this: but\nwhat is very striking, not one of them the right. Such is the chance of\nhealth in those hands through which the best means of it usually pass;\neven in the most regular course of application.\n\nI would not be understood to limit the little services I may this way be\nable to render the afflicted, to this single instance; much less to\npropose to myself any advantages from it. Whoever pleases will be\nwelcome to me, upon any such occasion; and whatever be the herb on which\nhe places a dependance, he shall be shewn it growing. I once recommended\na garden to be established for this use, at the public expence: one\ngreat person has put it in my power to answer all its purposes.\n\n                        F  I  N  I  S.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris, he was\n\"nominated\" to the Academy. He had but to present an Historical\nPainting in order to take his seat as an Academician.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VENUS AND MARRIAGE\n\n\nBack in his beloved Paris again; thrilled by the atmosphere and gaiety\nof its merry life; in the full vigour of manhood on the eve of his\nthirties; amongst congenial friends; done with the drudgery of winning\nto Academic honour, Boucher saw that the public were not falling over\neach other to purchase religious or historic pictures; he straightway\nturned his back upon these things, and on the edge of his thirtieth\nyear he gave to the world his \"Marriage of the Children of God with\nthe Children of Men,\" in which Venus is the avowed mistress of his\nadoration. It caused a fine stir, and greatly increased his repute.\n\nIn this picture he ends his Italian period and strikes his own\npersonal note. Both this and the \"Venus asking arms for Aeneas from\nVulcan,\" together with the \"Birth of Adonis\" and the \"Death of\nAdonis,\" of about the same period, still show Boucher strongly under\nthe influence of his master, Lemoyne. Indeed, the \"Birth\" and \"Death\nof Adonis,\" their record lost during the scuffle and confusion of the\nRevolution, for long hung side by side as pictures by Lemoyne, until,\nbeing cleaned about 1860, Boucher's initials were discovered upon\nthem, and, contemporary engravings being hunted up, still further\nproved their origin. But in the Venus that now figures in all his\nworks there is that flesh-painting of the nude, and that rosy touch\nupon the flesh of the female figure, that are a far more certain\nsignature of Boucher's handiwork than any written name.\n\nUnfortunately the Salons were closed during Boucher's earlier years\nuntil he was thirty-four, and the record of his work during these\nyears is difficult to follow; but with his service to Venus his\npersonal career begins, and the stream of his Venus-pieces steadily\nflows from his hands.\n\nHe came to her service rid of all prentice essays in craftsmanship, a\nfinished and consummate artist. He found in his subject a goddess to\nwhom he could devote his great and splendid gifts. He painted her\ndainty body with a radiant delight and a rare colour-sense such as\nFrance had never before seen or uttered. He remains to this day the\nfirst painter of the subtle, delicate, and elusive thing that is\nfemininity; he caught her allure, her charm, as he was to catch the\nfragrance and charm of children and flowers; and he set the statement\nof these things upon canvas as they have never been uttered.\n\nThe whole of his life long, Boucher gave himself up with equal and\npassionate devotion to work and to pleasure--working at his easel\noften twelve hours of his day without losing, to the end when the\nbrush fell from his dead fingers, his blitheness of heart or his\ngenerosity of act, and without weakening the pleasure-loving desires\nof his gadding spirit. Out of his splendid toil he made the means to\nindulge his tastes for pleasure; and the gratifying of his tastes in\nturn renewed and created the ideas that made the subjects of his\nartistry. He brought to all he did a joy in the doing that made of his\nvast labour one long pleasure--of his pleasures a riot of industry. He\nplayed as he toiled, scarce knowing which was play and which toil.\n\nThe gossip of his love-affairs makes no romantic story--they were but\ncommonplace ecstasies with unknown frail women. But hard as he worked\nand lived and played, he found time to get himself married in his\nthirtieth year to pretty seventeen-year-old Marie Jeanne Buseau, a\nlittle Parisian--and for love of her, so far as he understood the\nbusiness; for she brought him no dowry.\n\nThe young couple settled down for the next ten years in the Rue\nSaint-Thomas-du-Louvre. Here Boucher lived through his thirties.\n\nMadame was a pretty creature, if we had but Latour's pastel portrait\nalone to prove it. But the pretty features were the crown to as pretty\na body, for she sat often to her lord; and it is clear from his\ncorrespondence with a friend, Bachaumont, that she is the Psyche of\nhis illustrated fable--and Psyche runs much to the Altogether.\n\nMarriage, however, was not likely to imprison Boucher's gadding eyes;\nand it did not. Madame Boucher seems to have had as frail a heart, and\navoided strife by amusing herself, amongst others, with the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who, to gain access to the lady,\ncommissioned Boucher to do the Watteau-like illustrations to\nAcajou--a dull affair. Boucher's pretty wife, herself no mean\nartist, worked in his studio, and painted several smaller canvases\nafter his pictures, gaining some fame as a miniaturist and engraver.\n\nNor did Marriage turn Boucher from his art. Two years were gone by\nsince his nomination to the Academy; he had now to paint the formal\nHistorical Picture and present it in order to take his seat as\nAcademician; and it was in this his thirtieth year that he painted and\nwon his academic rank with the \"Renauld et Armide\" now at the Louvre.\n\nHere he sufficiently subordinated his own style to the academic to\nensure success; and the work was hailed by Academicians and critics,\nincluding Diderot, with enthusiasm. But even here we have his cupids\npeeping round the mythologic event; and Armide herself has pretty\nFrench lips that knew no Greek.\n\nOnce secure of his position, he straightway flung the last remnants of\nthe academic style out of his studio door; and it is a grim comment on\ncriticism that it was just exactly in proportion as he developed his\nown personal genius and uttered the France of his day, that he was\nattacked; whilst the stilted things that he knew were third-rate, and\nwhich he wholly rejected from henceforth, were exactly the things that\nwere praised!\n\nHis election to the Academy, and the enthusiasm over the picture that\nwon him his seat thereat, brought his name before the young king; the\nfollowing year he received his first order from the Court whose\npainter he was destined to become. The decorations in the queen's\napartments were gloomy and had grown black; and he painted in their\nstead the \"Charity,\" \"Abundance,\" \"Fidelity,\" and \"Prudence\" still\nthere to be seen. Indeed, with his gay vision, his pretty habit of\nculling only the flowers from the garden of life, and his quickness to\nset down the pleasing thing in every prospect, Boucher was the\ndestined painter of a Court weary of pomposity and the pose of the\nmock-heroic, and which was wholly giving itself up to pleasure and the\nelegances.\n\nBut neither his new dignity of Academician nor the royal favour, kept\nhim from the bookshops; and he illustrated, with rare beauty and a\ncharm worthy of Watteau, the great edition of the Works of Moli\u00e8re\nin his thirty-first year. It is true that he made as free with\nMoli\u00e8re's world as with the Gods of Olympus; he peoples the plays with\ncharacters of his own day, arrayed in the dress and habit of that day,\nand moving in surroundings that he saw about him.\n\n\nLE MONDE QUI S'AMUSE\n\n\nThe Homely had come upon the town out of Holland, painted with most\nconsummate artistry by Chardin, and was soon in the vogue. Boucher had\na quick eye for the mode. And he straightway set himself to the\npainting of \"La Belle Cuisini\u00e8re.\" Still-life and homely subjects need\nan accuracy of realism and a Dutch sense of these things, a sense of\nsincerity and an appreciation of the dignity of the work-a-day life of\nthe people, in which Boucher was wholly lacking. Above all, it calls\nfor a sense of \"character,\" which, in Boucher, was always weak. It was\na sneer against him that his very broomsticks called for pompons and\nribbons--and there was more than a little truth in the spite. He is\nmore concerned with the accident of the kissing of a kitchen-maid than\nwith the kitchen's habit. He cannot even peep into a scullery without\ndragging in Venus by the skirts, and tricking her out in a\nproperty-wardrobe of a scullery-wench, in which the girl is clearly\nbut acting the part.\n\nHowever, these passing vogues and experiments in different methods\nwere only gay asides--he was working the while upon his own subjects;\nand, to the display by its several members ordered by the Academy, he\nsent four little paintings of fauns and cupids which won him the\nhonour of election as deputy-professor. His brain and hand were very\nbusy, and he turns from one thing to another with amazing facility,\nbringing distinction to all that he does.\n\nBut he painted about this time two pictures of infants, \"L'Amour\nOiseleur\" and \"L'Amour Moissonneur,\" which were the beginning of that\nhost of cupids that he let fly from his studio; they frolic across his\ncanvases and join the retinue of Venus, peeping out from clouds, over\nwaves, round curtains, painted with a perfection that has never been\nsurpassed in the portrayal of infants. He painted their round limbs,\ntheir lusty life, their delightful awkwardnesses, their jolly fat\ngrace, their na\u00efve surprise at life and glory in it, as they had never\nbeen painted before, and have never been painted since.\n\nHe also gave forth in this his thirty-third year a \"Pastoral\" and a\n\"Shepherd and Shepherdess in Conversation,\" with sheep about them and\nin a pleasant landscape, which were his first essays in the style that\nhe created and which made him famous.\n\nHis friend Meissonnier, the inventor of the rococo, stood godfather to\nBoucher's first-born son in the May of 1736.\n\nFrom the very beginning Boucher seems to have been engraved. And these\nengravings, done by the best gravers of his day, greatly extended his\nreputation and popularised him; he fully realised the value of the\nadvertisement as well as his profits from it. Before his thirty-third\nyear was run out he published his well-known \"Cries of Paris.\"\n\nBoucher's description of them, \"studies from the low classes,\" holds\nthe key to that something of failure to realise the dramatic verities\nthat is over all; it gives also the attitude of the France that he\nknew towards the France that he did not, and could not understand. He\ncreated that dainty, pleasant atmosphere that comes floating up to the\nwindows on a fresh morning in Paris from the musical cries of\nthe street vendors; but of the deeper significance of the\nstreet-sellers--of the miserable accent in their life, of their weary\ntoil, of the dignity of their labour--he knew nothing; his brush could\nnot refrain from making elegance and fine manners peep from behind the\nstreet-porter's fustian or the milkmaid's skirt.\n\nBut his thirty-third year was to contain a more far-reaching\nsignificance even than the creation of his cupid-pieces and pastorals.\n\nThe \"Cries of Paris\" were scarce printed when Boucher's illustration\nto \"Don Quixote\" appeared--\"Sancho pursued by the servants of the\nDuke.\" This design was to have far-reaching results that Boucher\nlittle suspected.\n\nThe painter Oudry had been called to the conduct of the great tapestry\nlooms at Beauvais a couple of years before; and in his efforts to\nfurnish the looms with good designs, he now called Boucher to his aid,\nwhose original and fresh style, colour, and arrangement, together with\nhis personal vision, and the enthusiasm and zeal with which he threw\nhimself into the work, at once increased the reputation and the\nproducts of the famous looms. This large designing for the tapestries\nwas, in return, of immense value to the development of the genius of\nthe man, enlarging his breadth of style and giving scope to that great\ndecorative sense that was his superb gift. Thenceforth he was destined\nto play a supreme part in the history of the world-famed factories. He\nnow produced painting after painting for the Beauvais looms.\n\nLife is now one long triumph for Boucher, only disturbed in this year\nby the sad news of the suicide of his old master, Lemoyne. It was in\nthis, Boucher's thirty-fourth year, that the Salon was opened for the\nfirst time since Boucher's infancy, and he contributed several\ncanvases to it.\n\nRigaud, the old Academician, now close upon eighty, straggling through\nthe great galleries, might well blink and gasp at the change that had\ncome over French art since he last exhibited there, thirty-three years\ngone by; but his scoffs and regrets held no terrors for the younger\nAcademicians gathered about. He stood in a new world. A new generation\nwas in possession. The grand manner, the severe etiquette, formal\nmock-heroics, and solemn pomposity of Louis the Fourteenth were\nvanished, and the Agreeable and the Pleasant Make-Believe of Louis the\nFifteenth reigned in their stead. Old Rigaud might blink indeed! Just\nas the imposing and stilted etiquette of the reception-room had given\nplace to the easy manners and airy etiquette of the dainty boudoir, so\nhad light chatter and gay wit and the quick repartee usurped the heavy\nsplendours of a consequential age. France, weary of an eternal pose of\nthe grand manner, was seeking change in joyousness and amusement.\n\nGallantry and gaiety were become the object of the ambition of a\ndandified and elegant day. France became a coquette; dressed herself\nas a porcelain shepherdess; and with beribboned crook and sheep,\nseeking pleasant prospects to stroll through, gave herself to\ndalliance--her powder-puff and patch-box and fan a serious part of her\nunseriousness.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE CH\u00c2TEAUROUX\n\n\nAt thirty-five Boucher has arrived. He is in the vogue; in favour at\nCourt--as well as in the fashion. In his three years from taking his\nseat at the Academy to the opening of the first Salon he has created a\nnew and original style--his cupid pieces, his pastorals, his\nVenus-pieces, his tapestry. Boucher's kingdom lay in the realm of the\ndecorative painter--and he has found it. Torn from the surroundings\nfor which he designed them, as part and parcel of the general scheme,\nhis pictures are as out of place as an Italian altarpiece in an\nEnglish dining-room, yet they suffer less. Several may still be seen,\nas he set them up in frames of his own planning, as overdoors in the\npalace of the Soubise, now given up to the national archives.\n\nThe ghost of the Prince of Soubise, who commissioned them, may haunt\nhis palace, but his kin know the place no longer. The overdoors\nwrought by Boucher's skill look down now on the nation's collection of\nhistoric documents. The \"Three Graces enchaining Love,\" the fine\npastoral of \"The Cage,\" and the pastoral of the \"Shepherd placing a\nRose in his Shepherdess's Hair,\" were to see a mightier change than\nthe usurpation of Louis the Fourteenth's pompous age by the elegant\nyears of Louis the Fifteenth. But this was not as yet. Here at least\nwe see Boucher's art rid of all outside influences, and at the full\ntide of creation; here we have the inimitable lightness of touch, the\nfigures and landscape bathed in the airy volume of atmosphere.\n\nHe seems at this time to have played with pastel, due probably to his\nfriendship with Latour, who sent a portrait of Boucher's wife to this\nSalon. Boucher showed in the use of chalks the artistry and skill that\nwere always at his command.\n\nHe also was putting to its full use his innate sense of landscape,\nraising to high achievement that astonishing balance of landscape and\nfigures in his design--a balance that has never been surpassed; his\nfigures never override his landscape; his landscape never overpowers\nhis figures. His earnest counsels to his pupils and his constant\ndeploring of the lack of the landscape art in France prove the great\nstress he laid upon it.\n\nThe designing of a frontispiece for the catalogue of a personal\nfriend, one Gersaint, a merchant of oriental wares, started Boucher in\nhis thirty-third year upon that series of Chinese pictures and\ntapestries known as the \"Chinoiseries,\" in which he frittered away\nonly too many precious hours, for they were received with great favour\nby the public. The paintings of Chinese subjects designed for the\nlooms of Beauvais are still to be seen at Besan\u00e7on.\n\nBut busy as were his brain and hand in the exercise of his wide and\nversatile gifts, pouring out \"Chinoiseries,\" illustrations for books,\ntapestries on a large scale, landscapes, models for the gilt bronze\ndecorations of porcelain vases, scheming handsome frames for his\npictures, designing furniture and fans--Boucher was true, above all,\n\"to his goddess,\" and painted the famed \"Birth of Venus,\" which,\nthanks to the Swedish Ambassador's fondness for Madame Boucher, now\nhangs at Stockholm; our amorous Count de Tessin, to be just, seems to\nhave had a rare flair for the artistic--besides artist's wives. It was\non the 15th of April in 1742, the last year of his thirties, that the\nRoyal favour was marked by the grant of a pension of 400 livres\n(double florins) to Boucher with promise of early benefits to follow.\n\nTwo years afterwards it was raised to 600 livres.\n\nThis was the year that he painted the beautiful canvas of \"Diana\nleaving the Bath with one of her Companions,\" now at the Louvre. It\nwas also the year that saw his landscape, the \"Hamlet of Iss\u00e9\" at the\nSalon. This \"Hameau d'Iss\u00e9\" was to be enlarged for the Opera, proving\nhim to be decorator there, where he was arranging waterfalls,\ncascades, and the rest of the pretty business, without staying his\nhand from his art.\n\nAt forty Boucher has come into his kingdom. The ten years of these\nforties were to be a vast triumph for him. He was to produce\nmasterpiece after masterpiece. His art had caught the taste of the\nday. He was at the height of his powers. He had done great things--he\nwas to do greater. During these ten years of his forties he poured\nforth vivid and glowing works of sustained power and originality.\n\nWe have a picture of him as he was in the flesh at this time--the\npastel portrait by Lundberg, now at the Louvre--a gay, somewhat\ndissipated, handsomely dressed dandy of the time, smiling out of his\ncareless day, the debonnair man of fashion, the laughing eyes showing\nsigns of the night carousals, which were the rest from the prodigious\ntoil of this vital and forthright spirit.\n\nIt was in this our artist's fortieth year that the gifted old Cardinal\nFleury, who had guided the fortunes of France with rare skill, died,\nbroken by his ninety years and the blunders of the disastrous war that\nhe had so strenuously opposed; and Louis, essaying the strut of\nkingship, became king by act. His indolent character, unequal to the\nmighty business, his indeterminate will fretted by the set of\nquarrelling and intriguing rogues that he gathered about him as his\nministers, he fell into the habit that became his thenceforth, the\nonly thing to which he paid the tribute of constancy--he ruled France\nfrom behind pretty petticoats. He had early shown the adulterous blood\nof his great-grandfather; two, if not three, of five sisters of the\nnoble and historic house of De Nesle had yielded to his gadding fancy;\nthe youngest now ousted her sister De Mailly from the king's favour,\nwas publicly acknowledged as the king's mistress, and became Duchess\nof Ch\u00e2teauroux. Boucher painted her handsome being as a shepherdess in\none of his pastorals. She was no ordinary toy of a king. A woman of\ntalent, with hot ambitions for the king's majesty, fired with the\npride of race of the old French noblesse, it was during her short\nyears of ascendancy over the king that he roused from his body's\ntorpor and made an effort to reach the dignity and eminence befitting\nto the lord of a great and gallant people. He stepped forth awhile\nfrom his drunken bouts and manifold mean adulteries, and set himself\nat the head of the army in Flanders, and strutted it as conqueror.\n\nPoor Ch\u00e2teauroux only got the hate of the people for reward, Louis the\nhonours; for the people resented the public dishonour of her state.\n\nPower she found to be a dead-sea apple in her pretty mouth. The glory\nof it all, the splendours, were not the easily won delights for which\nshe had looked. She had to fight a duel, that never ended, with the\nking's witty, crafty, and scurrilous Prime Minister, the notorious\nMaurepas--and Maurepas willed that no woman should ever come between\nhim and the king--Maurepas who knew no mercy, no decency, no chivalry,\nno scruple. At Ch\u00e2teauroux's urging, Louis placed himself at the\nhead of the army; and France went near mad with joy that she had\nagain found a king. Crafty Maurepas urged on the business; the\nCh\u00e2teauroux suddenly realised his cunning glee--it separated her from\nthe king.\n\nOut of the whirl of things Boucher's fortune was ripening, little as\nhe might suspect it.\n\nHe was painting masterpieces that make his name live. To his fortieth\nyear belong the famed \"Birth of Venus,\" the \"Venus leaving the Bath,\"\nthe \"Muse Clio,\" the \"Muse Melpomene,\" and the three well-known\npastorals now at the Louvre--\"The Sleeping Shepherdess,\" the \"Nest,\"\n\n\nand the \"Shepherd and Shepherdesses.\" Of the many famous Venus-pieces\nthat his hand painted during these years it is not easy to write the\nlist. But having signed the \"Marriage of Love and Psyche\" at\nforty-one, he turned his experimental hand to the homely, realistic\nDutch style that was having a wide vogue, and painted the\n\"Dejeuner\"--a family of the prosperous class of the day at\nbreakfast--showing with rare charm the surroundings and home life of\nthe well-to-do of his time.\n\nAll goes well with Boucher. He changes into better quarters in the Rue\nde Grenelle-Saint-Honor\u00e9, where he lived for the next five years,\nuntil 1749; but his eyes are fixed upon a studio and apartments at\nthe old palace of the Louvre, though the hard intriguing of his\npowerful friends at Court on his behalf failed for some time. He had,\nindeed, to make another move before he arrived at his longed-for goal.\n\nPensions Boucher, like others, had found to be somewhat empty affairs;\nbut rooms at the Louvre were a solid possession eagerly sought after\nby the artists.\n\nIn this year of 1744 Boucher created a new fashion at the annual Salon\nby sending studies and sketches instead of finished pictures; and it\nset a value upon such things not before realised by artists, for\nsuccess was instant and loud.\n\nTowards the end of the next, Boucher's forty-second year, the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who was to take his leave of Paris,\ncommissioned four pictures to represent the day of a woman of fashion,\nand to be entitled \"Morning,\" \"Midday,\" \"Evening,\" and \"Night.\"\n\nBoucher painted one of these for him, now known as the \"Marchande de\nModes.\" The others were painted later, and all had a wide vogue as\nengravings. The correspondence has interest since it reveals Boucher's\nbusiness habits; he was paid for a picture on its delivery, and for\neach of these he was to receive 600 livres (double florins or\ndollars)--about a hundred and twenty pounds.\n\nIn an official document of the Director of Buildings to the king (or\nMinister of Fine Art, as we should say), written in this year of 1745,\nBoucher being forty-two, is a \"list of the best painters,\" in which\nBoucher is singled out for distinction as \"an historic painter, living\nin the Rue de Grenelle-Saint-Honor\u00e9, opposite the Rue des Deux-Ecus,\npupil of Lemoyne, excelling also in landscape, grotesques, and\nornaments in the manner of Watteau; and equally skilled in painting\nflowers, fruit, architecture, and subjects of gallantry and of\nfashion.\"\n\nNot so bad for dry officialdom; the critics could learn a lesson. For\nhe was nothing less. What indeed does he not do? and wondrous well!\nthis painter of the age.\n\nAnd the mighty rush of events is about to sweep him into further\nprominence; the very things which he probably passed by with a gay\nshrug are to enrich him, to help him to his highest fulfilment.\n\nPoor Ch\u00e2teauroux saw that she must lose the king's gadding favour in\nthe conflict with Maurepas unless she joined her lord, now with the\narmy. She realised full well that she had created the new Louis of\nAmbition--that her going must bring the people's hate to her. But she\ndared not lose the king. And she went. Maurepas had overdone his\njibings. The indiscretion at once rang through the land; became the\njest of the army--and Maurepas was not far from the bottom of the\nbusiness. The discreet indiscretion of covered ways between the king's\nlodgings and hers only added to the mockeries, and increased the\npeople's hate against, of course, the Ch\u00e2teauroux. Then upon a day in\nAugust the small-pox seized Louis at Metz; poor Ch\u00e2teauroux fought for\npossession of the king in the sick room, until his fear of\ndeath--Louis' sole piety--sent her packing--shrinking back in the\nhired carriage at each halting-place for change of horses, lest she\nshould be seen and torn from her place and destroyed by the populace.\n\nBut Louis recovered; Paris rang with bells at joy on his recovery, and\nhe entered the city amidst mad enthusiasm, hailed as The Well-Beloved.\n\nHe sent for the Ch\u00e2teauroux to find her dying, Maurepas having to\ndeliver the message of recall. She died suddenly and in great agony,\nswearing that Maurepas had poisoned her--died in the arms of her poor\ndiscarded sister, the De Mailly.\n\nBut this year of 1745 Boucher hears a mightier scandal that is to mean\nvast things to all France--and not least of all to Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE POMPADOUR\n\n\nA young bride had become the gossip of the rich merchant society of\nParis--that class that was ousting the old noblesse from power. She\nwas a beautiful, a remarkable woman; her wit was repeated in the\ndrawing-rooms, she had all the accomplishments; her charming\nname--Madame Lenormant d'Etioles.\n\nDraw aside the curtains of the past and we discover our little Jeanne\nPoisson--grown into this exquisite creature. It has come about in\nstrange fashion enough. The father--a scandalous fellow--having\nfingered the commissariat moneys in ugly ways to his own use, had been\nbanished for the ugly business. Nor is Jeanne's mother any better than\nshe should be; and the wags wink knowingly at the handsome and rich\nman of fashion, Monsieur Lenormant de Tournehem, who has been the\nfavoured gallant during the absence of the light-fingered Poisson.\n\nAnd, of a truth, Lenormant de Tournehem takes astonishing interest in\nthe little Jeanne--watching over her up-growing and giving her the\nbest of education at the convent, where she wins all hearts, and is\nknown as \"the little queen.\" The truth spoken with wondrous prophecy,\nif unthinkingly, as we shall see. Complacent Poisson came home, and\ntook the rich and fashionable, bland and smiling Lenormant de\nTournehem to his arms. Has he not wealth and estates? therefore as\nexcellent a friend for Poisson as for Madame Poisson. The girl Jeanne\nleaves the convent to be taught the accomplishments by the supreme\nmasters of France, the wits foregather at Madame Poisson's, and the\nbrilliant Jeanne is soon mistress of the arts--coquetry not least of\nall; has also the most exquisite taste in dress. Under all is a heart\ncold as steel; calculating as the higher mathematics. She has but one\nhindrance to ambition--her mean birth. Lenormant de Tournehem rids her\neven of this slur by making his nephew, Lenormant d'Etioles, marry\nher, giving the young couple half his fortune for dowry, and the\npromise of the rest when he dies--also he grants him a splendid\ntown-house, as splendid a country seat. And consequential\nself-respecting little Lenormant d'Etioles is lord of Etioles, amongst\nother seignories. So Jane Fish appears as Madame Lenormant d'Etioles,\nseductive, beautiful, accomplished, to whose house repair the new\nphilosophy, the wits, and artists. She has a certain sense of virtue;\nindeed openly vows that no one but the king shall ever come between\nher and her lord. But, deep in her heart, she has harboured a fierce\nambition--that the king shall help her to keep her bond. She puts\nforth all her gifts, all her powers, to win to the strange goal;\nconfides it to her worldly mother and \"uncle,\" Lenormant de Tournehem;\nfinds keen allies therein to the reaching of that strange goal. The\ndeath of the Ch\u00e2teauroux clears the way. At a masked ball the king is\nintrigued as to the personality of a beautiful woman who plagues him\nwith her art; he orders the unmasking. Madame Lenormant d'Etioles\nstands revealed, drops her handkerchief as by accident; the whisper\nruns through the Court that \"the handkerchief has been thrown!\" The\nking stoops and picks it up. A few evenings later she is smuggled into\nthe \"private apartments.\" She goes again a month later; in the morning\nis seized with sudden terror--she daren't go back to her angry lord\nlest he do her grievous harm; he will have missed her. The king is\ntouched; allows her to hide from henceforth in the secret apartments;\npromises the beautiful creature a lodging, her husband's banishment,\nand early acknowledgment as titular mistress--before the whole Court\nat Easter, says the pious Great One. But he has to join the army to\nplay the Conqueror at Fontenoy; and it is later in the year\n(September) before Madame d'Etioles is presented to the Court in a\nvast company and proceeds to the queen's apartments to kiss hands on\nappointment. Thus was Jeanne Poisson raised to the great aristocracy\nof France in her twenty-third year as Marquise de Pompadour.\n\nBoucher had been one of the brilliant group of artists of the\nd'Etioles' circle. That the Pompadour's influence had much effect upon\nhis position at Court for a year or two is unlikely; for she had to\nfight for possession of the king day and night, as the Ch\u00e2teauroux\nhad done, against the queen's party and the unscrupulous enmity of\nMaurepas. To set down Boucher's favour at Court to her is ridiculous.\n\nHe was painting for the queen's apartments at thirty-one when the\nPompadour was a school-girl of twelve. But in the year following her\nrise to power, Boucher painted four pictures for the large room of the\nDauphin, which were \"placed elsewhere\"; and, the year after that, he\nwas at work upon two pictures for the bedroom of the king at the\ncastle of Marly. It is likely enough that the Pompadour directed this\norder. She had almost immediately secured the office of the\nDirector-General of Buildings, which covered the direction of the\nroyal art treasures, for \"uncle\" Lenormant de Tournehem, who was also\na friend of the artist. And from this year it is significant that\nBoucher paints no more for the opposing camp of the Queen and Dauphin.\n\nHe was now giving all his strength to the \"Rape of Europa\" that he\npainted for the competition ordered by the Academy at the command of\nLenormant de Tournehem in the king's name, in which ten chosen\nAcademicians were to paint subjects in their own style for six prizes\nand a gold medal, to be awarded in secret vote by the competing\nartists themselves. Boucher won, by his amiable nature, the good-will\nof them all by proposing that they should so arrange as to share the\nprizes equally, and thus prevent any sense of soreness inevitable in\nthe losers.\n\nBut greatly as he won the good-fellowship of his fellow-artists by it,\nthis picture caused a murmur to rise amongst the critics who,\naforetime loud in his praise, now began to complain of his \"abuse of\nrose tints\" in the painting of the female nude. The fact was that\nDiderot and the men of the New Philosophy were turning their eyes to\nthe whole foundations upon which France was built, art as well as\nsociety, and were beginning to demand of art \"grandeur and morality in\nits subjects.\" They were soon to be clamouring for \"the statement of a\ngreat maxim, a lesson for the spectator.\" Diderot, with bull-like\ncourage, picked out the greatest, and turned upon Boucher, blaming him\nfor triviality.\n\nThe nations, weary of war, concluded the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in\nthe October of 1748. No sooner was peace concluded than Louis\nrelapsed into his old habit of dandified indolence and profligate\nease; and, putting from him his duties as the lord of a great people,\nhe gave himself up to shameless intrigues. He allowed the Pompadour to\nusurp his magnificence and to rule over the land. He yielded himself\nutterly, if sometimes sulkily, to her domination; and for sixteen\nyears she was the most powerful person at Court, the greatest force in\nthe state--making and unmaking ministers, disposing of office,\nhonours, titles, pensions. All political affairs were discussed and\narranged under her guidance; ministers, ambassadors, generals\ntransacted their business in her stately boudoirs; the whole patronage\nof the sovereign was dispensed by her pretty hands; the prizes of the\nChurch, of the army, of the magistracy could be obtained solely\nthrough her favour and good-will. Her energy must have been\nprodigious. Possessed of extraordinary talents and exquisite tastes,\nshe gave full rein to them, and it was in the indulgence of her better\nqualities that Destiny brought Boucher into the friendship of this\nwonderful woman. She became not only his patron but his pupil,\nengraving several of his designs.\n\nBut this, her sovereignty over the king, easy and light in its outward\nseeming, was a haggard nightmare to the calculating woman who had so\nlonged for it. She knew no single hour's rest from the night she won\nto the king's bed. She had to fight her enemies, secret and open, for\npossession of the king's will, day and night; and she fought--with\nrare courage. She won by consummate skill and unending pluck. She made\nherself an essential part of the king's freedom from care. The Court\nparty fought her for power with constant vigilance. Maurepas brought\nall his unscrupulous art, all his ironic mimicry, all his vile jibes\nand unchivalrous hatred to bear against her. He had made himself a\nnecessity to the king; and he never slept away a chance of injuring\nher. He knew no mercy, no nobility, no pity. He made her the detested\nobject of the people. With his own hands he penned the witty verses\nand epigrams that were sung and flung about the streets of Paris.\n\nBut she had an enemy more subtle than any at the Court--hour by hour\nshe had to dispute the king with the king's boredom. And it was in the\neffort to do so that she created her celebrated theatre in the\nprivate apartments, calling Boucher and others to her aid in the doing\nof it. Here the noblest of France vied with each other to obtain the\nsmallest part to play, an instrument in its orchestra, an invitation\nto its performances.\n\nBoucher left the Opera to become its decorator in 1748, and did not\nreturn until her death. For her, he also decorated her beautiful rooms\nat Bellevue. She bought at high prices many of his greatest\nmasterpieces.\n\nThe Pompadour's power so greatly increased that she openly took\ncommand of the king's will; dared and succeeded in getting his\nfavourite Maurepas banished; and herself took to the use of the kingly\n\"we.\" Her rascally father was created Lord of Marigny; her brother,\nwhom the king liked well and called \"little brother,\" was created\nMarquis de Vandi\u00e8res; her only child, Alexandrine, signed her name as\na princess of the blood royal, and would have been married to the\nblood royal had she not caught the small-pox and died. She amassed a\nprivate fortune, castles, and estates such as no mistress had dreamed\nof; and into them she poured art treasures that cost the nation\nthirty-six millions of money. She created the porcelain factory of\nS\u00e8vres, kept keen watch over the Gobelins looms, and founded the great\nMilitary School of St. Cyr amidst work that would have kept several\nstatesmen busy, and of deadly intrigues at Court that would have\nbroken the spirit of many a brilliant man.\n\nIt was in her hectic desire to keep the king from being bored that she\nstooped, and made Boucher stoop, to the employment of his high\nartistry in the painting of a series of indecent pictures wherewith to\ntickle the jaded desires of Boredom, and thereby gave rise to the\nwidespread impression that Boucher's art was ever infected by base\ndesign. But Boucher was, at his very worst, but a healthy animal; and\neven in these secret works for the king he did not reach so low as did\nmany an artist of more pious memory who painted with no excuse but his\nown pleasure.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the Pompadour has been blamed too much for this\nevil act, and too much forgotten for her splendid patronage of the man\nwho, under it and during these great years of his forties, produced a\nseries of masterpieces that place him in the foremost rank of the\npainters of his century. It is impossible to reckon the number of the\npastorals and Venus-pieces that his master-hand painted and loved to\npaint, during these the supreme years of his genius. It is significant\nthat they were painted during the years that saw the Pompadour in\nsupreme power.\n\nBoucher was so firmly established in 1750, his forty-seventh year,\nthat he moved into a new house in the Rue Richelieu, near the Palais\nRoyal. Disappointed in not receiving a studio and apartments at the\nLouvre, he was allowed to use a studio in the king's library. He was\nnow making money so easily that he was able to collect pictures and\nprecious stones and the gaily coloured curiosities that appealed to\nhis tastes.\n\nThe critics were becoming more and more censorious; and one of them\nhits true with the comment that in his pastorals his shepherdesses\nlook as if they had stepped over from the Opera and would soon be off\nagain thereto.\n\nIn his forty-eighth year Boucher's art was at its most luminous\nstage--his atmosphere clear and subtle and exquisitely rendered; his\nyellows golden; his whites satin-like and silvery; his flesh-tones\nupon the nude bodies of his goddesses unsurpassed by previous art. The\nbeauty of it all was not to last much longer.\n\nLenormant de Tournehem died suddenly in the November of 1751; the\nPompadour's brother, Abel Poisson de Vandi\u00e8res, was appointed\nDirector-General in his stead at the age of twenty-five--and soon\nafterwards, on the death of his father, created Marquis de Marigny--a\nshy, handsome youth, a gentleman and an honourable fellow, whom the\nking liked well, and against whom his sister's sole complaint was that\nhe lacked the brazen effrontery of the courtiers of the day. No man\ndid more for the advancement of the art of his time. A pension of a\nthousand livres falling vacant, the young fellow secured it for\nBoucher; and almost immediately afterwards, a studio becoming vacant\nat the Louvre owing to the death of Coypel, first painter to the king,\nBoucher came to his coveted home, eagerly moving in with his family as\nsoon as its wretched state could be put into repair.\n\nThe decoration of the new wing to the palace at Fontainebleau brought\nthe commission for the painting of the ceiling and the principal\npicture in the Council Chamber to Boucher, who had already decorated\nthe Dining-Room. This was the period of his painting the \"Rising\" and\nthe \"Setting of the Sun\" for the Pompadour, now in the Watteau\ncollection, two canvases that were always favourites with the painter,\nbitterly as they were assailed by the critic Grimm.\n\nHe was turning out so much work that it was impossible to give as much\ncare to his pictures as he ought. For he refused sternly, his life\nlong, to raise his prices; by consequence he had to create a larger\namount of work in order to meet his expenditure. It was about this\ntime that Reynolds, passing through Paris, went to visit him and found\nhim painting on a huge canvas without models or sketches. \"On\nexpressing my surprise,\" writes Reynolds, \"he replied that he had\nconsidered the model as necessary during his youth until he had\ncompleted his study of art, but that he had not used one for a long\ntime past.\"\n\nHe soon had not the time, not only to paint from nature but even to\ngive his pictures the work necessary to complete them. The feverish\nhaste which took possession of him in his frantic endeavour to meet\nthe vast demand for his pictures, and the eager efforts of his\nengravers to satisfy the public call for engravings after his works,\ngave him less and less leisure to joy in their doing. And his eyesight\nbegan to fail. His flesh-tints deepened to a reddish hue; and he\nstands baffled before his work, suspecting his sight, since what every\none cries out upon as being bright vermilion, he only sees as a dull\nearthy colour. Boucher has topped the height of his achievement; he\nhas to \"descend the other side of the hill.\" Boucher begins to grow\nold.\n\nIn Boucher's fifty-first year an ugly intrigue of the queen's party at\nCourt to sap the Pompadour's influence over the king by drawing away\nthe king's affections towards Madame de Choiseul-Romanet, a reckless\nyoung beauty of the Court, brought about a strange alliance. The Count\nde Stainville, one of the Pompadour's bitterest enemies, was shown the\nking's letter of invitation to his young kinswoman; and he, deeply\nwounded in his pride that his kinswoman should have been offered to\nthe king, went to the Pompadour and exposed the plot. A close\nalliance followed; and De Stainville thenceforth became her chief\nguide in affairs of state. It was at her instance that the king called\nhim to be his Prime Minister, raising him to the Duchy of Choiseul--a\nname he made illustrious as one of the greatest Ministers of France.\n\nIn his fifty-second year Boucher was appointed to the directorship of\nthe Gobelins looms, to the huge delight of the weavers and all\nconcerned with the tapestry factory. This was the year of his painting\nthe famous portrait of the Pompadour, to whom he several times paid\nthis \"tribute of immorality.\" For the Gobelins looms he produced many\nhandsome designs; and he was painting with astounding industry. But\nhis hand's skill began to falter. His art shows weariness in his\nsixtieth year, and sickness fell upon him, and held him in servitude\nnow with rare moments of respite. The critics, notoriously Diderot,\nwere now attacking him with shameless virulence. Boucher passed it all\nby; but he felt the change that was taking place in the public taste.\n\nThe ideas of the New Philosophy were infecting public opinion; the Man\nof Feeling had arisen in the land; and France, humiliated in war, and\nresenting the follies and the greed of her shameless privileged class,\nwas openly resenting it and all its works. Choiseul had planted his\nstrength deep in the people's party, and was come near to being its\ngod. His masterly mind had checked Frederick of Prussia to the North;\nand the nations, exhausted by the struggle, signed the Peace of Paris\nin 1763. Choiseul, with France at peace abroad, turned to the blotting\nout of the turbulent order of the Jesuits at home. Their attempt to\nend the Pompadour's relations with the king made this powerful woman\neager to complete his design; the chance was soon to come, and the\nOrder was abolished from France and its vast property seized by the\nstate.\n\nThe Pompadour lived but a short while to enjoy her triumph. Worn out\nby her superhuman activities, assailed by debt, she fell ill of a\nracking cough, dying on the 15th of April, 1764, in her forty-second\nyear, keeping her ascendancy over the king and the supreme power in\nFrance to her last hour. Death found her transacting affairs of state.\n\nLouis, weary of his servitude, had only a heartless epigram to cast\nat the body of the dead woman as she passed to her last resting-place.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE END\n\n\nThe death of the Pompadour robbed Boucher of a friend; but her\nbrother, Marigny, remained faithfully attached to the old artist, and\nseized every chance to honour him. On the death of Carle van Loo,\nBoucher, at sixty-two, was made first painter to the king, with all\nhis pensions and privileges that were consistent with this the supreme\nappointment in the art world.\n\nThere had been serious intention of making Boucher the head of the\nEcole des El\u00e8ves Proteg\u00e9s; he had the art of making himself liked and\nof inspiring the love of the arts. He was very popular with the\nstudents and artists, owing to his kindliness, his eagerness to render\nservice, his readiness to encourage the youngsters or to console them.\n\nWhen the riot took place, provoked by the Academicians by their award\nof the Prix de Rome in 1767, the students insulted the Academicians,\nbut hailed Boucher with enthusiastic applause. The reason was not far\nto seek. When a student came to the old master for advice he did not\n\"play the pontiff,\" and, scorning the false dignity of big phrases, he\ntook the brush in his hand and showed the way out of all difficulties\nby simplehearted example, despising rules, and putting himself out in\norder to make things clear to a young artist.\n\nHowever, the Academicians feared he would be an unorthodox master for\nyouth, and appointed another in his place.\n\nA long and serious illness thwarted his keen energies. Diderot was\ngiving himself up to outrageous violence against him. If the old\npainter exhibited at the Salon, Diderot fiercely assailed his art; if\nhe did not exhibit, Diderot as bitterly assailed him for his\nnegligences. Above all, he attacked Boucher in that he did not paint\nwhat Diderot would have painted--but could not. \"When he paints\ninfants,\" cries Diderot, \"you will not find one employed in a real act\nof life--studying his lesson, reading, writing, stripping hemp.\"\n\nPoor unfortunate infants! for whom Philosophy could find no happier\njoy in life than stripping hemp! Boucher was but an artist. He\npainted his generation as far as he could see it, and, with all his\nfaults and weaknesses, he never debauched his art with foreign and\nalien things that had no part in the nation's life; he painted fair\nFrance into his landscapes, not a make-believe land he did not know\nwith preposterous Greek ruins; and best of all, to his eternal honour,\nhe painted infants glad in their gladness to be alive, with no desire\nto send their happy little bodies to school, with no sickly ambition\nto make them into budding philosophers, with no thought of making them\npose and lie as Men of Feeling. He had no joy in setting their little\nbodies to toil--in making them \"teach a lesson to the spectator,\" in\nmaking them stoop their little shoulders to the \"picking of hemp.\"\n\nHe continued to paint as he had always painted--except that he painted\nless well. The wreath of roses was wilting on a grey head. The blood\njigged less warmly in the frail body. The features showed pallid--the\neyes haggard. The sight failed. The hand alone kept something of its\ncunning.\n\nHe went to Holland with his friend Randon du Boisset, but health\nshrank farther from him. Diderot had near spent his last jibe.\n\nIn 1768, Boucher's sixty-fifth year, the neglected queen went to her\ngrave. The king's grief and contrition and vows to amend his life came\ntoo late, and lasted little longer than the drying of the floods of\ntears over the body of his dead consort. A year later he was become\nthe creature of a pretty woman of the gutters, whom he caused to be\nmarried to the Count du Barry--the infamously famous Madame du Barry.\n\nBut neither the remonstrances of Choiseul with the king against this\nfurther degradation of the throne of France, nor his unconcealed scorn\nof the upstart countess, nor the dangerous enemy he made for himself\nthereby, signified now to Boucher, first painter to the king.\n\nBoucher was failing. His son was a prig and a disappointment. His two\nfavourite pupils, Baudoin and Deshayes, who had married his two girls,\ndied.\n\nTo the Salon of 1769 he sent his \"Caravan of Bohemians.\" It was his\nlast display. He had been going about for some time like a gaunt ghost\nof his former self, afflicted with all the ills inevitable to a life\nfeverishly consumed in work and the pursuit of pleasure.\n\nThey went to his studio at five of the clock one May morning, and\nfound him seated at his easel, before a canvas of Venus, dead, with\nthe paint-filled brush fallen out of his fingers.\n\nSo passed he away on the 30th of May 1770, in his sixty-seventh year.\n\nWhen Boucher died, the generation of which he was the limner was near\ncome to its violent end. The rosy carnivals and gay gallantries of his\nage gave way to the blood-stained romance and fierce tempest of the\nRevolution. The garrets of the old curiosity-shops received the\ndiscarded canvases of the master. His shepherds and shepherdesses were\nput to rout by the Romans of his pupil, citizen David. The old order\nwas brought into contempt and overthrown. And with it, Boucher's art,\nlike much that was gracious and charming and good in the evil thing,\nwent down also, and was overwhelmed for a while.\n\nFor a while only. For just as, out of the blood and terror of the\nRevolution, a real France arose, phnix-wise, from the ruin, and in\nbeing born, whilst putting off the vilenesses of the thing from which\nshe sprang, took on also to herself the gracious and winsome qualities\nthat place her amongst the most fascinating peoples of the ages; so\nBoucher has come into his kingdom again--the most gracious of painters\nthat the years have yielded."

                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n        a. One bed, or folding cot,\n        b. One oil stove,\n        c. One lamp,\n        d. Enough supplies of all kinds sufficient for six months,\n        e. Pots, pans, kettles, etc.\nIt is needless to say that positions in Manila and Iloilo were now at\na premium.\n\nWas it possible that teachers were to be sent to places where even the\nnecessaries of life could not be obtained! Was it possible that many\nwould be sent to places so remote that for six months no fresh\nsupplies could be gotten! A mass meeting was held at once, and a\ncommittee was appointed to send a cablegram to the Associated Press\npetitioning aid from the American people at large. Realizing what\nconsternation would be created throughout the United States by such a\nmessage, two of the teachers leaped into a carriage at the close of\nthe meeting and a few moments later were closeted with the chief\nexecutive of the department. As a result the committee was persuaded\nnot to send the cablegram to the Associated Press until by courtesy it\nhad been sent to the President. Of course, this diplomatic move tided\naffairs over and the teachers who had flatly refused to budge from\nManila now agreed to go on to their stations, being assured that\nwhatever action was best would be taken.\n\nThe day had come when we must separate. We were to enter an untried\nand an unknown field. It was fitting that we have a final joyous\nmeeting, so the best orchestra in the archipelago was engaged and we\n\"chased the hours with flying feet\" until dawn so that whatever might\ncome to us in that unknown future upon which we were entering each\nwould hold in pleasant memory our last evening together.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER III. - A DRAMA IN ACTUAL LIFE.\n\n\nAlmost every one heeded the warning to go to his station forearmed\nwith at least necessaries of life, but, as it had never fallen to the\nlot of the writer to cook, he refused to learn at that late day, so he\ntook no pot, no pan, no kettle, putting his future into the hands of\nan uncertain fate and relying upon the unknown hospitality of the\nFilipino.\n\nBacalod, the capital of the province of Occidental Negros, was our\ndestination. The second morning after leaving Manila, we awoke with\nthe \"Kilpatrick\" lying at anchor in a shallow bay. We were several\nmiles from the shore and nothing in sight indicated that we had\nreached a place of any importance. Late the night before we had been\nawakened by the loud, sharp ringing of the ship's bells, accompanied\nby the reversal of the engines and a general disturbance awaking the\ncrew. So our first impressions on coming on deck were that we had run\naground. But the captain assured us that everything was ship-shape and\nthat this was the nearest point of approach to Capiz, a town of\nconsiderable importance on the island of Panay, where a body of troops\nwas to embark for home. Not even the grass hut of a native was in\nsight. Search as we would, not a sign was seen of a stream flowing\ninto the sea, indicating the probable presence of a town. There was\nnot a sign of life of any kind save one lone column of thin, blue\nsmoke that arose from the side of a mountain miles away. One would\nhave thought that we were explorers of three hundred years ago lying\noff the shore of some unknown land.\n\nAfter breakfast the steam launch, together with all the boats, was\nlowered, and several of us who had determined to miss no opportunity\nto gather information about the islands took our places in the launch\nby the side of the ship's mate, and steamed away across the water with\na long line of boats strung out in the rear. We headed away toward a\ngroup of cocoanut trees, and about an hour later stepped ashore on a\npile of decayed coral rocks that extended some twenty or thirty feet\nout into the water, thus forming the only landing place of a town of\nseveral thousands of people and of considerable commercial importance.\n\nA few moments after we had landed, an army wagon drawn by a\nmagnificent pair of mules came up out of a tropical jungle along a\nnarrow road. We clambered into the wagon and were soon lost in the\ndepths of foliage from which we had just seen the vehicle emerge.\n\nLong waving bamboos with their plumy leafage hung over the road from\neach side, meeting and overlapping in the center until they formed an\narchway so dense that the tropical sun now high in the heavens\npenetrated it only at intervals. At times the wagon sank up to the\nhubs in the soft earth, and the muscles of the mules stood out like\nwhip-cords under the skin as they drew us forward.\n\nAt a sharp turn in the road we came upon the first division of troops\nthat was to embark for home. The look of joy upon their sun-browned\nfaces was inexpressible. Their work was done, and with elastic step\nand smiling faces they saluted us as they passed by. The reign of\nforce was at an end; it was going out with them; the reign of peace\nhad begun; it was coming in with us.\n\nIn the afternoon when we returned from the town the last of the troops\nhad arrived and, as we drove up, the bugle was sounding the call to\nsupper. We noticed native women mingling with the troops and, indeed,\na native woman was in constant attention waiting upon one of the\nsoldiers with whom we ate. Her clothes were clean, her hair was nicely\ncombed, and her general appearance was neat. She seemed to anticipate\nthe slightest wish of the soldier with whom she was. She brought him\nwater to drink, cleaned his plate after the meal and saw that his\nknife, fork, and spoon were put into his haversack.\n\nWe had now finished supper and the launch had returned for the last\nload of troops. The lieutenant in command of the company gave the\norder to \"fall in\"; the men shouldered their rifles and fell into\nline. \"Forward, march!\" called the lieutenant, and the column swept\nforward towards the boats. The women had until now restrained\nthemselves, but, as their husbands marched away never to return, their\nfeelings could no longer be restrained. One young woman of about\neighteen, who was leaning against a rock by the roadside sobbing, when\nher husband passed, leaped up in frenzy of passionate love and caught\nthe rifle from his shoulder. Her first impulse seemed to be to throw\nthe gun away, but suddenly realizing the futility of such an act she\nburst into tears, shouldered the rifle herself and marched on by his\nside. Another woman of more mature age threw her arms around the legs\nof a tall stalwart man, and drew him bodily from the line.\n\nBut the troops marched on and entered the boats. One woman who had\nbeen unnoticed before came down into the shallow water and caught hold\nof our last boat as if to prevent its leaving, while others stood\nmingling their sobs with the sounds of the wavelets as they broke on\nthe sands. As we passed away, an expectant mother, standing in bold\noutline against the twilight sky, threw up her hands in an agony of\ndespair and then sank upon the stones. The curtain had fallen upon a\ndrama in actual life deeper in pathos than any other we had ever seen\nor ever expected to see. Depth of passion, depth of love! Who can\nfathom the human heart?\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. - WHAT THE TEACHERS DID.\n\n\nThere is a remarkable sameness about the towns in the Philippines.\n\nThey all have a large open square about the middle of the town, around\nthree sides of which are Chinese stores, unless one side lies open to\nthe sea, and on the fourth is the great stone ecclesia. The streets\nrun at right angles to one another and divide up the town into\ncreditable squares.\n\nEverybody in the Philippines lives up-stairs, for the ground is so\nsoaked with water during the rainy season that it is a menace to\nhealth to live upon the ground floor. So even the poorest nippa hut\nis built upon stakes four or five feet above the ground.\n\nBacalod is a typical Philippine town. As we landed, a broad open\nsquare was spread out before us. Two sides of the square were lined\nwith two-story houses in which were Chinese stores below and Filipino\nhomes above. On the third side stood the great stone church in whose\nmassive tower the clock was striking the hour of four, while the\nfourth lay open to the sea that had borne us thither.\n\nWe landed, but it was in a method new to us and one not usually\nemployed by the traveling public.\n\nWhen our sail boat ran aground on the sandy bottom a hundred yards or\nmore from the shore, a crowd of Filipino men who were on the beach\nslowly rolled up their pantaloons and waded out to the rescue,--for\nthe money that was in it. The boat's crew elevated their trousers'\nlegs also and slided down into the water. Each of us then straddled\nthe neck of a Filipino standing in the water and was held by ankles to\nbe steadied while our biped mounts proceeded to the shore.\n\nWe were now on the ground and face to face with the situation. To give\nthe reader an idea of the actual conditions met by the first teachers\nwho went to the Islands, the following is copied from the instructions\ngiven us in Manila:\n    1. There shall be two sessions daily of all schools, and the\n    last hour of the morning session shall be devoted solely to\n    instructing the Filipino teachers.\n\n    2. In cases where teachers are sent to a town in which there\n    is no school-house, they are expected to secure the aid of the\n    people and have one built.\n\n    3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is\n    stopped.\n\n    4. All supplies must be kept under lock and key. In towns\n    where there is no case or box to lock the supplies in, and it\n    is also impossible to get the town council to furnish a case,\n    a requisition may be sent to Manila, and, if an appropriation\n    can be secured, one will be made and sent out.\n\nThus it can be easily seen that we were indeed pioneers. In many\nplaces no school-house was to be found, and in some cases it was even\ndifficult to get the town council to provide a case in which to keep\nthe supplies.\n\nThe work of the teachers was, in short; to \"make the English language\nthe basis of instruction in the public schools.\" On our arrival at\nBacalod two schools were found in progress, for some soldiers had been\ndetailed for the work here previous to our coming. One of these was\nfor boys and the other, for girls. Thus the work here had been in a\nmeasure simplified, but complications that had arisen at Talisay, one\nof the largest and richest towns on the island, demanded a change of\nteachers and the writer was assigned to the place as superintendent.\n\nHere an attempt had been made to start a school but it had failed\nignominiously and a system of education was to be put into operation\nfrom the very start.\n\nThe Filipinos are not strong advocates of co-education, so separate\nschools were to be started for the boys and the girls. The one for the\nboys was gotten well in hand before the one for the girls was\nattempted at all.\n\nA few days after reaching the town and securing a home the\npresidente of the town had it publicly announced that the following\nMonday morning at eight o'clock a public school for boys would be\nopened in a building that had been rented for the purpose by the\nmunicipal council. About the middle of the afternoon of the same day a\nman beat a little drum throughout all the streets of the town to call\nthe people out and the town clerk announced both in Spanish and in the\nnative language that this public school would begin at the time and\nplace mentioned above; that instruction would be free to all who came;\nthat the government would furnish all supplies; and that instruction\nwould be given in the English language. A native principal and\nassistants were employed and everything was ready to begin.\n\nThe official report of the result is as follows:\n    Boys' public school of Talisay, Negros, P. I., began November\n    4, 1901. Forty-three boys present at eight o'clock. Forty-one\n    of them knew \"good morning\" and \"good afternoon\" but do not\n    know the distinction between them. Two of them speak simple\n    Spanish. At eight forty-five, eight more, who had been\n    attending an early morning private school, came in together.\n\n    The books they brought were so varied and so different from\n    one another that it seemed impossible to bring any reasonable\n    degree of order out of such a chaos, and so, after struggling\n    vainly for about a week with the problem, the superintendent\n    by one fell stroke removed everything in use and put in a\n    uniform system, and from that day on the English language has\n    been the basis of instruction in the public schools of\n    Talisay. The work was of necessity very slow at first, but by\n    the end of a year two schools were going nicely and a number\n    of the brightest boys and girls had made really excellent\n    progress.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER V. - A \"BAILE.\"\n\n\nNot long after the arrival of our party at Bacalod we received an\ninvitation to a \"baile\" given in our honor by the inhabitants of\nSilay, a town some ten or twelve miles up the northern coast and one\nnoted for its social life. The invitation was accepted with pleasure,\nand about the middle of the afternoon on the day appointed we were\nclad in the immaculate white of the tropics and steaming away up the\ncoast on board a launch sent for our conveyance. Twilight was still\nlingering on the path of day when we anchored just off shore at the\ntown. A row-boat containing the officials of the city came out to meet\nus and, in due season, we were ushered into a spacious drawing-room\nfilled almost to overflowing with the \u00e9lite of the town. The \u00e9lite of\ntowns in the Philippines speak Spanish, and, as only one or two of our\nparty could at that time boast of more than a formal acquaintance with\nthe Castilian tongue, the exchange of ideas that evening between us\nand the Filipinos was of necessity not very rapid.\n\nThe necessity of easy communication between us was rendered somewhat\nless indispensable by the announcement of supper as soon as we were\nrested from our trip. When we had taken our places at the table a\nyoung Filipino about twenty-five years of age arose and gave a lengthy\ntoast to the recent union of the Philippines with the United States.\n\nBut as we Americans were unable to scale the dizzy heights of his\nclimaxes or sink to the depths of his pathos, we forewent the\npleasures of his oratory and turned our attention to the savory odor\nof lamb, chicken, and roast pig that came slyly stealing up our\nnostrils to send us nerve dispatches about the gastronomic delights of\nour not far distant future.\n\nAt last the toast was ended and the world-wide soup ushered in a long\ntrain of things good to eat, served in a style better fitted to the\ndelights of the appetite than to the formalities of dinners, for, as\nsoon as the pleasant task of one dish was completed by any one, the\nnext was served him at once regardless of the progress made by the\nothers at the table.\n\nThe last course was dulce. The new-comers to the Philippines will\nnot be long in making the acquaintance of this dish, and at all\nmeetings, both public and private, where eatables are served, it\nperforms an important part. It is anything sweet, and it may vary all\nthe way from an india-rubber-like black mixture of cocoanut milk and\ndirty sugar to a really toothsome and respectable confection. No\nmatter of what materials a dish is composed, just so long as it is\nsweet, it is dulce.\n\nAfter paying our respects to this last course, we arose from the table\nand entered a great rectangular room from the center of whose ceiling\nhung a large glass chandelier, a mass of shimmering crystals. In the\nchairs around the room were the wealth, the youth, and the beauty of\nthe town.\n\nThe first and also the last number of every Filipino dance of any\nformality is the \"rigodon.\" The dancers are arranged in a square, or\nquadrangle according to the number participating, and are then led\nthrough a tangled maze of figures that so utterly bewilders the novice\nthat he sinks into his chair at the end of the dance wondering how it\nall came to pass.\n\nWe Americans breathed a sigh of relief when the \"rigodon\" ended, and\nmustered fresh courage for social conquests in the waltz that was now\nbreathing forth from the trembling strings. My companion in the first\ndance had been the young lady by whose side I had sat at dinner. But\nit now became necessary to search for another, so I prudently waited\nto see how partners were chosen, and made no mistake when a few\nmoments later I faced one of the most luscious looking se\u00f1oritas on\nthe opposite side of the room and offered her my arm. My eyes must\nhave told the story that my lips could not utter in Spanish, for she\nsmiled upon me sweetly, arose, and put her hand upon my shoulder. My\narm encircled her waist and I began to waltz. Unfortunately my\ncompanion did not follow, but began to hop up and down in a manner\nmost distressing. Supposing the attack to be only temporary, I paused\nand, much to my relief, she soon showed signs of recovery; and in the\ncourse of time she came to a standstill looking up into my face in an\ninquiring sort of way, apparently wondering why St. Vitus had not paid\nhis respects to me also. A second attempt to follow the music met with\nresults similar to the first, and during the third attempt, which\nseemed to be trembling on the verge of a failure, St. Vitus let go my\ncompanion and seized me with such vigor that she, who was small even\nfor a Filipino, was gathered up bodily and taken around the room at\nsuch a pace that her toes touched the floor only at far distant\nintervals.\n\nAt this point my devotion to the shrine of Terpsichore ceased from\nforce of circumstances and I seated myself in one of the most\ncomfortable chairs in sight that I might carry out a previously formed\nplan to study the Filipino somewhat critically as he appears in\nsociety.\n\nThe first thing that impressed me as the dancers passed up and down\nthe room was the flash of diamonds. Nearly every woman in the room had\non a brooch that flashed the colors of the rainbow at every turn.\n\nAlmost all of them wore one or more rings that showed up brilliantly\nunder the chandelier. Many of the men too, especially the young men,\nwore gems that appeared to be exquisite. A closer inspection showed\nthat some of the gems had flaws and others were of a poor color, but\nno one would have denied that, taken as a whole, it was a really\nbeautiful display.\n\nThe dress of the ladies was richly colored. Many of their skirts were\nof silk covered with hand embroidered flowers, and their filmy pina\nwaists and broad collar pieces were rich with needle-work. They all\nwore a kind of heelless velvet slipper, very common as a dress shoe in\nthe Philippines, or high-heeled patent leather shoes with neatly\nfitting black stockings.\n\nThe men were dressed in white coats and white pantaloons or black\ncoats and white pantaloons. White shirts and collars, together with\nall sorts and styles of cravats and low-cut patent leather shoes with\nhighly colored socks completed their dress.\n\nIt was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money;\nthat they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a\ntable loaded with good things was a fact to which all of us were\nenthusiastic witnesses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VI. - A SKETCH OF LIFE IN THE PHILIPPINES.\n\n\nHouse-keeping in the Philippines presents some interesting phases. Our\nclub of American officials decided to run a mess, so we employed a\ncook and a house boy, then each of us provided himself with a personal\nservant, making a total of six servants for four men--it takes about\nthis proportion of servants to live in any sort of comfort in the\nPhilippines--and launched ourselves boldly upon the sea of domestic\neconomy. But there were shoals ahead of us, for the question of\nregulating servants is one of no small importance in the Philippines,\nand one of its most disadvantageous features is the long chain of\ndependents that usually attends it.\n\nWe gave the cooks so much a day with which to buy supplies in the\nlocal market, for our own table, making him render a daily list of\nexpenditures, and a fixed amount besides to purchase rice and fish for\nhimself and the other servants. Of course, if they wished to vary\ntheir diet and get chicken and fresh pork, which could be had at far\ndistant intervals, it was wholly a matter of their option, but the\nallowance was made on the basis of so much rice and fish a day for\neach. This allowance was about fifteen cents a day in Spanish coin per\nservant.\n\nThus far all was well. We had agreed to give the cook eight dollars a\nmonth in Spanish money, thinking that good wages would procure good\nservice, but the visions of affluence that floated before him on such\nfloods of wealth were so alluring that they drew him from the kitchen\nto the cooler veranda. In less than a week he had employed an\nassistant at four dollars a month; in less than another week that\nassistant had employed him an assistant at two dollars a month; in\nless than another week that assistant to the assistant had employed\nhim an assistant at the princely salary of fifty cents a month; and\nfrom fear that the chain of dependents would end only by our having\nthe whole Filipino race attached to our culinary force, we broke up\nhouse-keeping and went boarding again, choosing that as the less of\nthe two evils.\n\nOur house furnishings were almost wholly Philippine. The table ware\nand the food on the table came from the ends of the earth. The knives\nand forks were made in Germany, the plates were manufactured in\nEngland, the glass ware and table cloth, in the United States. The\noatmeal and flour came from the United States also. The butter came\nfrom Australia, the rice from China, the salt from Russia, and the\nother eatables from sources about as various as their separate names.\n\nSwitzerland furnished the condensed milk and Illinois the canned\ncream. Nearly all of the canned fruit bore labels from Spain.\n\nThus it can easily be seen that life in the Philippines, if lived\naccording to American ideals, is dependent upon a highly developed and\nhighly complex commerce. However, the difficulties of transportation\nand the restriction of large stocks of merchandise to Manila and some\nhalf a dozen other towns, make so great a difference between country\nlife and city life that a short comparison of the two will not be out\nof place, and life in Manila may well be taken as being fairly typical\nof the latter.\n\nLife in Manila is pleasant, but expensive. It is pleasant from the\nfact that it is not only the capital but also metropolis of the\narchipelago. Thus the combination of wealth and high official position\nhas given to Manila a society of the highest and most refined type.\n\nThe process of beautifying and improving the city which is constantly\ngoing on bids fair to give us at no distant day a city of which we may\nwell be proud.\n\nBut let him who intends living well in Manila on a small income bid\nfarewell at once to so idylic a dream, for it costs much to live well\nthere. In the city of Manila one can get almost anything he wishes,\nbut it must be paid for at the price it commands. Especially in the\ncase of eatables, this price is by no means small, because to the\nfirst cost of articles must in most cases be added the expense of\ndistant shipment from American, European, or Australian ports, and not\ninfrequently the cost of long refrigeration must also be taken into\nconsideration. But, expensive though it is, it is very pleasant to\nlive there and those who have once enjoyed it often wish again to\nquaff the cup of its delights.\n\nIn strong contrast to this pleasant life is the life of the quiet\nlittle hamlet away in the distant islands. Indeed, the Filipino from\nthe distant town, who by some good fortune has been to Manila, or, by\na coup de main, has studied in one of the Manila colleges, is looked\nup to in a true hero-worshiping attitude by all who either know him or\nhear of his fame. Life in such a place is one long state of harmless\ninactivity. Not a wave of trouble from the great outer world ever\ndisturbs its peaceful repose. One lounges forever in an air of\nindolent ease and extreme aversion to anything approaching what might\nbe called a respectable effort.\n\nOne arises in the morning about the time the sun's first rays silver\nthe top leaves of the cocoanut trees and then stirs around until nine\nor ten o'clock, when it is found expedient to avoid a further exposure\nto the sun. From then until about five o'clock in the afternoon it is\nbest to take things as they come, even though one of those things be a\nFilipino dinner. But then you may have your vehiclo attached to a\nyoung bull with a ring in his nose and go for a drive. If it is the\ndry season you will probably enjoy the drive unless you object to the\nfrequent clouds of dust swept along by the evening wind. If it is in\nthe rainy season your pleasure will depend to a considerable extent\nupon how wet you get; but, whether the season be wet or dry, your\npleasure will be regulated largely by the state of harmony existing\nbetween the driver and the bull.\n\nIn these quiet secluded nooks successive generations of Filipinos are\nborn, reared, grow old and die in an even chain of events broken only\nby the occasional erection of a new grass house on the identical spot\nwhere its predecessors have stood for ages. The son lives in the house\nof his father, cultivates the same few square feet of soil planted in\nedible roots, climbs the same cocoanut trees, follows the same winding\npath down to the stream, pounds rice in the same mortar and with the\nsame stick that his ancestors have used from time unremembered, and,\nin case of illness, curls up on a grass mat in a corner of the room\nuntil he dies or by some good fortune recovers. Beyond this narrow\nhorizon he never looks. So narrow and contracted is the life that the\nlanguages of two towns a few miles apart are so different that one\nwould scarcely recognize them as belonging to the same race of people.\n\nSuch are the two extremes of life in our new far Eastern provinces:\nthe one is active, progressive, and cosmopolitan; the other, inactive,\ndecadent, and narrow; but, whether one enjoys the first or endures the\nsecond, there comes to him after leaving a longing to lounge again in\ntropic airs and listen to the lullaby of the winds among the palms.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VII. - THE FILIPINO AT HOME.\n\n\nAs one enters a Filipino sitting-room for the first time, there is one\nfeature in the arrangement of the furniture that impresses itself upon\nhim at once, and it may be stated without fear of serious\ncontradiction that this same peculiar feature in its arrangement will\ncontinue to face him, as he enters different homes, about as certainly\nas he crosses the threshold.\n\nThe arrangement referred to is that of one large mirror, one settee,\nand some ten or a dozen chairs that appear to have had a certain\norderly affection for one another. The mirror is hung upon one of the\nlarge interior parts of the house about four feet above the floor. The\nwooden houses in the Philippines are built by setting large posts\nupright into the ground, extending into the air from twenty to thirty\nfeet. Cross timbers are fastened to these upright posts about eight or\nten feet above the ground and then not sawed off even with the posts,\nbut allowed to extend beyond them each way. The framework of the house\nis built upon these extending cross timbers, a style of building by\nwhich these large upright posts are left standing out on the inside of\nthe room from one to three feet from the walls. It is on that one of\nthese posts most nearly opposite the door that the mirror always finds\nits place. Immediately beneath the mirror is the settee; and the\nchairs are arranged in two parallel lines facing one another and at\nright angles with the ends of the settee. However odd this arrangement\nmay appear to one when he first enters a Filipino drawing-room, there\nare two things to be said in its favor. In the first place, it places\nyou face to face with the person with whom you are conversing so that\nyou can watch him,--a matter of no small moment in the Philippines. In\nthe next place, it enables you to give one of the young ladies a\nsheep's-eye in the mirror while the others present are left where\nMoses was in our much abused conundrum.\n\nThe size of the residence and the quality of its furnishings depends\nupon the wealth of the owner. But there is so vast a difference\nbetween the mode of life of the highest class and the tao, or lowest\nclass, that it is well to speak of them separately, and the great\nmiddle class of Filipinos can easily be imagined to occupy the\nintervening ground.\n\nThe rich Filipino's house is usually of wood built upon a wall of\nstone or brick from ten to fifteen feet high. The floors are kept\nhighly polished in his hallway, dressing-room, and bed-rooms. There\nare, of course, no fire-places in any of the rooms, but on some\noccasions something is needed to dry the rain-soaked atmosphere, for\neven in the dry season it has been seen to rain for five successive\ndays and nights without the cessation of a moment.\n\nA long chain of dependents is attached to the household of the rich\nFilipino. The master has his special body servant to be present at all\ntimes to do his master's bidding, in short, to be the visible\nmechanism of his master's volition. So, too, the lady of the house has\nher servant woman to do the slightest bidding of her ladyship. Then\nthere is the cook who is almost invariably a man, a house boy or two,\nand the coachman. These functionaries, with their assistants and\nassistants to the assistants, together with a servant or two for the\nexclusive service of the children, complete the economic household.\n\nSuch a family has an abundance of rice and wheat bread, also of\nchicken and fish with occasional fresh beef. They have also a good\ndeal of dulce. They regularly serve wine and frequently serve beer\non their tables.\n\nIn strong contrast with this mode of life is that of the tao. His\ndiet consists almost wholly of rice and small uncleaned fish boiled\ntogether. As a rule knife, fork, plate, and spoon find no place in his\nhousehold. The rice and fish are boiled in a pot and then allowed to\ncool in the same vessel or poured out to cool in a large earthen or\nwooden bowl. Then Mr. Tao together with Mrs. Tao and all the young\nTaos squat on their heels around the mixture and satisfy that\nintangible thing called the appetite. They do not use chop sticks as\nthe Chinese do, but the rice and fish are caught in a hollow formed by\nthe first three fingers of the right hand. The thumb is then placed\nbehind the mass. It is raised up and poised before the mouth, with a\nskill coming from the evolution of ages, when a contraction of the\nmuscles of the thumb throws the mass into the mouth with a skill that\nis marvelous to any but a Filipino. To judge from the most reliable\ninformation, the poorest class do not have an abundance of food,\nalthough it would seem that such a condition of things would be\nwell-nigh impossible. However, in a census of one hundred school\nchildren there were found six boys and four girls who declared that\nthey had never had enough to eat, and the native teacher stated that\nthis was probably true.\n\nThe wide gulf between the tao and the rich man is filled by the\ngreat middle class of Filipinos.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VIII. - VISIT TO A LEPER COLONY.\n\n\nNot far from our town was a leper colony and the first Saturday that\ncould be spared was set aside for a trip to the place. It happened\nthat none of the other Americans were at leisure on this particular\nmorning, but, rather then delay the trip or miss it altogether, the\nwriter, armed with a revolver, started out alone.\n\nThe road had been described so accurately by one who was supposed to\nknow it that it was deemed well-nigh impossible to miss the way. The\nmain highway was followed to the point where the by-path supposed to\nlead to the settlement turned off through some bamboo thickets and a\nlow tropical wood. This path led straight away towards the sea-coast\nwhere the houses of the colony were said to stand in a cocoanut grove\nby the beach.\n\nUpon arriving at the settlement, a very inhospitable reception was\nreceived from a mangy cur that growled and showed a very uninviting\nset of sharp, white teeth behind his snarling lips. The growling of\nthe dog had attracted the attention of an old man who, with age-bent\nback, was pounding rice in a mortar about fifty yards away. He turned\nslowly around and, upon seeing an intruder into the primitive quiet of\nthe place, gave a sharp, far-reaching call. The sound had scarcely\nrung through the grove when from about a dozen of the little grass\nhouses dotted here and there fifteen or twenty men armed with bolos\ncame out and gathered around the old man. A sense of my danger flashed\nupon me. Three miles from town and alone in a tropical jungle, I could\nbe almost instantly overcome by this band of bolo-men, and the only\nreport that would ever reach my people would be that I had\n\"disappeared.\" Of course, attack was by no means certain, but the\npotentiality of the situation was thrilling. A drawn revolver and the\ngleaming of its shining barrel had the effect of stopping the men, who\nseemed to be hesitating as to a course of action, until a somewhat\ndignified retreat was made to an open space in the rear from where a\nless dignified and a more hasty retreat began which did not stop short\nof Bacalod.\n\nEnough had been seen, however, even in this short visit, to give\nconvincing proof that the settlement visited was no colony of lepers;\nso, that afternoon two servant boys being taken as guides and\ninterpreters, another attempt was made to reach the goal desired.\n\nThis attempt was successful, and, after about two hours of walking, a\nlittle cluster of grass huts snugly hidden by the sea-coast came into\nview. As we approached, one would have thought it a gala-day. Some few\nchildren, apparently from six to thirteen years of age, almost wholly\nnude, were romping and playing in the open space around which the huts\nstood, and no one would ever have thought that any cloud so horrible\nas leprosy could hover over a place apparently so happy.\n\nBy the side of the path as we passed was a man and his wife setting\nout potato plants. His hands were so puffed and his fingers so short\nthat he could scarcely use them, but he was working along as best he\ncould. His wife's feet were so swollen and twisted that she walked\nonly with the greatest difficulty. We passed them by and entered the\nopen space above referred to.\n\nThe children now saw us, and those of them who could darted away like\nfrightened rabbits, each to his own burrow. An old man who was sitting\nin the warm afternoon sun on the little bamboo platform before his hut\nwas aroused from his lethargic repose by the scampering away of the\nchildren. He arose, trembling upon his tottering limbs, all drawn and\ntwisted, and hobbled away into his hut.\n\nThe children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at\nthe doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of\nthe settlement. In a few moments we were surrounded by a circle of\nhuman beings at once so repulsive and so pitiable that its graphic\nvividness can never be accurately portrayed.\n\nThe old man referred to above, having put on a pair of snow-white\npantaloons, appeared now at the doorway of his hut, followed a few\nmoments later by his wife who had evidently clothed herself in the\nbest raiment she had. At a call from the old man, all the men, women,\nand children in the settlement came out of their huts and stood in a\nline before us. The old man was spokesman and in his native visayan\ntongue made a heart-rending appeal for aid which we were powerless to\ngive. Attention was called to a leper woman, apparently about\ntwenty-five years of age, whose face had been attacked by the disease\nand whose appearance was truly pathetic. Upon her hip was a child\nabout a year and a half old and, strange to say, the child showed as\nyet no signs whatever of the disease.\n\nWhat an indissoluble enigma is life! Here in a little cluster of grass\nhuts in a secluded nook of a secluded island of an all but secluded\narchipelago was gathered together a little community of wretched\nnatives, driven by their loathsomeness from association with others\neven of the same half-savage race. Yet here, men and women loved and\nwere married, by mutual trust if not by law, and children were born of\nthe union to live forever under the unspeakable horror that\novershadowed the unfortunate parents. Love, hatred, sorrow, and\njoy--every passion that enters into the complex structure of the human\nheart even here, in this scene of sadness and despair, was playing\napparently as freely as where misfortune and disease had never crossed\nthe portals of life.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER IX. - A \"HIKE.\"\n\n\nWe were lounging lazily in our hammocks at Jimamaylan one evening in\nApril. Supper was just ended, and the soldiers in the post were\ncollected in groups here and there spinning yarns to pass away the\ntime, when a Filipino clad only in a loin cloth came down the street\nat a steadily swinging run and stopped in front of the sentry. He\nbrought the announcement that a band of ladrones had just burned a\nsugar mill and were advancing to sack a barrio about fifteen miles\naway.\n\nThe invitation of the commanding officer to go on a \"hike\" was eagerly\naccepted, and, in ten minutes after the message was given, the troops\nwere on the march followed by two adventurous pedagogues.\n\nDarkness was just closing in as we left the town, but a resplendent\ntropic moon soon made the night almost as brilliant as the day. The\ntrail we followed led over rough and rocky country. Sometimes for a\ndistance of a mile or more we passed over barren wastes of volcanic\nslag poured out in anger by some peak whose convulsions have long\nsince ceased. Again we would descend into a tropical jungle from the\ndense foliage of which the ladrones could have leaped at any moment,\nhad they known of our coming, and annihilated our little band. We\nforded rapid streams with the water at our breasts, and halted only\nonce in that rapid march of fifteen miles.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the town we met a man who was standing\nguard against a surprise by the ladrones. Nothing could well have been\nmuch more grotesque and nothing could much better illustrate the\nabsolutely primitive condition of the Filipinos in the interior of the\nislands than the appearance of this guard. A pair of knee pants, a\nconical grass hat, and a hemp shirt formed his entire apparel. A long\nflat wooden shield, a bolo, and a long bamboo spear with a sharp,\nflat, iron point, completed his equipment for battle.\n\nHere stood the first and the twentieth centuries side by side. The\nFilipino who had advanced only a stage beyond the condition of\nprimitive man with his knife, spear, and wooden shield, stood side by\nside with the American soldier, a representative of modern life with\nhis magazine rifle, his canteen, his knapsack,--with every article of\nhis clothing made to give him the highest possible efficiency as the\nunit of a military organization.\n\nA few yards farther on we met another guard equipped similarly to the\nfirst. Upon reaching the town, news had just been received that a\ndetachment of troops from another post had intercepted the ladrones\nand fought a skirmish with them. The ladrones had escaped and we set\nout in pursuit of them on a chase wilder than a Quixotic dream. We\nwound our way into the mountains behind the town, inquiring at every\ngrass hut we passed whether the band of ladrones had passed that way,\nbut only once was even a trace of them found. Then it was learned that\nat a certain place they had separated into groups of three or four and\ngone glimmering through the dream of things that were. This place was\nin a secluded nook of the mountains where in years gone by some\nadventurous Spaniard had erected a primitive water mill to grind his\nsugar-cane. We had now marched about twenty miles and the feet of the\npedagogues were a mass of blisters. They had reached the point where\nthat form of military maneuvering called \"hiking\" ceased to possess\nany alluring charms. So a native was persuaded to come out of his lone\nmountain hut and hitch up his carabao and cart. He was then made to\nget on the carabao's back, while the aforesaid pedagogues lay down on\nthe sugar-cane pulp that had been put into the body of the cart, and\nthe driver was instructed to start for the post we had left hours\nbefore, and not to stop until he got there. Being uncertain but that\nsome of the ladrones would learn of our having left the body of troops\nand would try the metal of our steel, we at first agreed that neither\nof us should go to sleep, but it was later decided that probably the\ndriver had no greater desire to cross the Styx than his passengers had\nand that in case of danger he would awaken us, so both took a revolver\nin each hand, stretched out supinely and went to sleep.\n\nSuch a sleep! The rough jolting of the cart over an almost impassable\nroad was never enough to break the spell of slumber. When we awoke the\nblazing tropic sun was past the midday mark of morning, shining full\ninto our unprotected and well-nigh blistered faces.\n\nA pack of dogs were heralding our approach to a little village at the\nfoot of the mountains where ponies were procured to take us back to\nthe post.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he insists, \"have stood the test of ages; and the plant\nevery where retained its name and credit: and one of our good\nherbarists, who had seen a wonderful case of a swoln spleen, so big, and\nhard as to be felt with terror, brought back to a state of nature by it\"\n\n(p. 37). The greatest portion of Hill's concluding section combines\nadvertisement for the powder medicine he was himself manufacturing at a\nhandsome profit together with a protest against competing apothecaries:\n\"An intelligent person was directed to go to the medicinal herb shops in\nthe several markets, and buy some of this Spleen-wort; the name was\nwritten, and shewn to every one; every shop received his money, and\nalmost every one sold a different plant, under the name of this: but\nwhat is very striking, not one of them the right\" (p. 42).\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis did not cease to be printed after Hill's in\n1766, but continued to issue from the presses into the nineteenth\ncentury. A good example of this is the tome by John Reid, physician to\nthe Finsbury Dispensary in London, Essays on Insanity, Hypochondriasis\nand Other Nervous Affections (1816), which summarizes theories of the\nmalady. A bibliographical study of such works would probably reveal\na larger number of titles in the nineteenth century than in the previous\none, but by this time the nature and definition of hypochondria had\nchanged significantly.\n\nIf John Hill's volume is not an important contribution in the history of\nmedicine, it is a lucid and brief exposition of many of the best ideas\nthat had been thought and written on the hyp, with the exception of his\nuninhibited prescribing of herbal medicines as cure-alls. An\nunderstanding of this disease is essential for readers of neoclassical\nEnglish literature, especially when we reflect upon the fact that some\nof the best literature of the period was composed by writers whom it\nafflicted. It is perhaps not without significance that the greatest poet\nof the Augustan age, Alexander Pope, thought it necessary as he lay on\nhis deathbed in May 1744 to exclaim with his last breath, \"I never was\nhippish in my whole life.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. I. - The NATURE of the DISORDER.\n\n\nTo call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and cruel. It\nis a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by thickened\nand distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver, and other\nparts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick scarce knows\none more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\n\nThe blood is a mixture of many fluids, which, in a state of health, are\nso combined, that the whole passes freely through its appointed vessels;\nbut if by the loss of the thinner parts, the rest becomes too gross to\nbe thus carried through, it will stop where the circulation has least\npower; and having thus stopped it will accumulate; heaping by degrees\nobstruction on obstruction.\n\nHealth and chearfulness, and the quiet exercise of mind, depend upon a\nperfect circulation: is it a wonder then, when this becomes impeded the\nbody looses of its health, and the temper of its sprightliness? to be\notherwise would be the miracle; and he inhumanly insults the afflicted,\nwho calls all this a voluntary frowardness. Its slightest state brings\nwith it sickness, anguish and oppression; and innumerable ills follow\nits advancing steps, unless prevented by timely care; till life itself\ngrows burthensome.\n\nThe disease was common in antient Greece; and her physicians understood\nit, better than those perhaps of later times, in any other country; who\nthough happy in many advantages these fathers of the science could not\nhave, yet want the great assistance of frequent watching it in all its\nstages.\n\nThose venerable writers have delivered its nature, and its cure: in the\nfirst every thing now shews they were right; and what they have said as\nto the latter will be found equally true and certain. This, so far as\npresent experience has confirmed it, and no farther, will be here laid\nbefore the afflicted in a few plain words.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. II. - Persons Subject to it.\n\n\nFatigue of mind, and great exertion of its powers often give birth to\nthis disease; and always tend to encrease it. The finer spirits are\nwasted by the labour of the brain: the Philosopher rises from his study\nmore exhausted than the Peasant leaves his drudgery; without the benefit\nthat he has from exercise. Greatness of mind, and steady virtue;\ndetermined resolution, and manly firmness, when put in action, and\nintent upon their object, all also lead to it: perhaps whatever tends to\nthe ennobling of the soul has equal share in bringing on this weakness\nof the body.\n\nFrom this we may learn easily who are the men most subject to it; the\ngrave and studious, those of a sedate temper and enlarged understanding,\nthe learned and wise, the virtuous and the valiant: those whom it were\nthe interest of the world to wish were free from this and every other\nillness; and who perhaps, except for this alloy, would have too large a\nportion of human happiness.\n\nThough these are most, it is not these alone, who are subject to it.\n\nThere are countries where it is endemial, and in other places some have\nthe seeds of it in their constitution; and in some it takes rise from\naccidents. In these last it is the easiest of cure; and in the first\nmost difficult.\n\nBeside the Greeks already named, the Jews of old time were heavily\nafflicted with this disease; and in their descendants to this day it is\noften constitutional: the Spaniards have it almost to a man; and so have\nthe American Indians. Perhaps the character of these several nations may\nbe connected with it. The steady honour, and firm valour of the\nSpaniard, very like that of the ancient Doric nation, who followed the\nflute not the trumpet to the field; and met the enemy, not with shouts\nand fury, but with a determined virtue: it is the temper of the\nHypochondriac to be slow, but unmoveably resolved: the Jew has shewn\nthis mistakenly, but almost miraculously; and the poor Indian, untaught\nas he is, faces all peril with composure, and sings his death-song with\nan unalter'd countenance.\n\nAmong particular persons the most inquiring and contemplative are those\nwho suffer oftenest by this disease; and of all degrees of men I think\nthe clergy. I do not mean the hunting, shooting, drinking clergy, who\nbear the tables of the great; but the retir'd and conscientious; such as\nattend in midnight silence to their duty; and seek in their own cool\nbreasts, or wheresoever else they may be found, new admonitions for an\nage plunged in new vices. To this disease we owe the irreparable loss of\nDr. YOUNG; and the present danger of many other the best and most\nimproved amongst us. May what is here to be proposed assist in their\npreservation!\n\nThe Geometrician or the learned Philosopher of whatever denomination,\nwhose course of study fixes his eye for ever on one object, his mind\nintensely and continually employed upon one thought, should be warned\nalso that he is in danger; or if he find himself already afflicted, he\nshould be told that the same course of life, which brought it on, will,\nwithout due care, encrease it to the most dreaded violence.\n\nThe middle period of life is that in which there is the greatest danger\nof an attack from this disease; and the latter end of autumn, when the\nsummer heats have a little time been over, is the season when in our\nclimate its first assaults are most to be expected. The same time of the\nyear always increases the disorder in those who have been before\nafflicted with it; and it is a truth must be confessed, that from its\nfirst attack the patient grows continually, though slowly, worse; unless\na careful regimen prevent it.\n\nThe constitutions most liable to this obstruction are the lean, and dark\ncomplexioned; the grave and sedentary. Let such watch the first\nsymptoms; and obviate, (as they may with ease) that which it will be\nmuch more difficult to remove.\n\nIt is happy a disease, wherein the patient must do a great deal for\nhimself, falls, for the most part, upon those who have the powers of\nreason strongest. Let them only be aware of this, that the distemper\nnaturally disposes them to inactivity; and reason will have no use\nunless accompanied with resolution to enforce it.\n\nThough the physician can do something toward the cure, much more depends\nupon the patient; and here his constancy of mind will be employed most\nhappily. No one is better qualified to judge on a fair hearing what\ncourse is the most fit; and having made that choice, he must with\npatience wait its good effects. Diseases that come on slowly must have\ntime for curing; an attention to the first appearances of the disorder\nwill be always happiest; because when least established it is easiest\noverthrown: but when that happy period has been neglected, he must wait\nthe effects of such a course as will dilute and melt the obstructing\nmatter gradually; for till that be done it is not only vain, but\nsometimes dangerous, to attempt its expulsion from the body.\n\nThe blood easily separates itself into the grosser and the thinner\nparts: we see this in bleeding; and from the toughness of the red cake\nmay guess how very difficult it will be to dissolve a substance of like\nfirmness in the vessels of the body. That it can thus become thickened\nwithin the body, a Pleurisy shews us too evidently: in that case it is\nbrought on suddenly, and with inflammation; in this other, slowly and\nwithout; and here, even before it forms the obstruction, can bring on\nmany mischiefs. Various causes can produce the same effect, but that in\nall cases operates most durably, which operates most slowly. The watery\npart of the blood is its mild part; in the remaining gross matter of it,\nare acrid salts and burning oils, and these, when destitute of that\nhappy dilution nature gives them in a healthy body, are capable of doing\ngreat mischief to the tender vessels in which they are kept stagnant.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. III. - The SYMPTOMS of the DISORDER.\n\n\nThe first and lightest of the signs that shew this illness are a lowness\nof spirits, and inaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love\nof solitude and a habit of thinking, even on trifling subjects, with too\nmuch steadiness. A very little help may combat these: but if that\nindolence which is indeed a part of the disorder, will neglect them;\nworse must be expected soon to follow.\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness, weight, and oppression in the body,\na want of appetite, or, what is worse, an appetite without digestion;\nfor these are the conditions of different states of the disease, a\nfullness and a difficulty of breathing after meals, a straitness of the\nbreast, pains and flatulencies in the bowels, and an unaptness to\ndischarge their contents.\n\nThe pulse becomes low, weak, and unequal; and there are frequent\npalpitations of the heart, a little dark-coloured urine is voided at\nsome times; and a flood of colourless and insipid at others; relieving\nfor a moment, but increasing the distemper: there is in some cases also\na continual teazing cough, with a choaking stoppage in the throat at\ntimes; then heartburn, sickness, hardness of the belly, and a costive\nhabit, or a tormenting and vain irritation.\n\nThe lips turn pale, the eyes loose their brightness and by degrees the\nwhite grows as it were greenish, the gums want their due firmness, with\ntheir proper colour; and an unpleasing foulness grows upon the teeth:\nthe inside of the mouth is pale and furred, and the throat dry and\nhusky: the colour of the skin is pale (though there are periods when the\nface is florid) and as the obstruction gathers ground, and more affects\nthe liver, the whole body becomes yellow, tawny, greenish, and at length\nof that deep and dusky hue, to which men of swift imagination have given\nthe name of blackness.\n\nThese symptoms do not all appear in any one period of the disease, or in\none case, but at one time or other all of them, as well as those which\nfollow: the flesh becomes cold to the touch, though the patient does not\nhimself perceive it; the limbs grow numbed and torpid, the breathing\ndull and slow, and the voice hollow; and usually the appetite in this\nperiod declines, and comes almost to nothing: night sweats come on,\nblack swellings appear on the veins, the flesh wastes and the breast\nbecomes flat and hollow: the mouth is full of a thin spittle, the head\nis dizzy and confus'd, and sometimes there is an unconquerable numbness\nin the organs of speech.\n\nI have known the temporary silence that follows upon this last symptom\nbecome a jest to the common herd; and the unhappy patient, instead of\ncompassion and assistance, receive the reproof of sullenness, from those\nwho should have known and acted better.\n\nAbout twenty years ago I met on a visit at Catthorpe in Leicestershire a\nyoung gentleman of distinguished learning and abilities, who at certain\ntimes was speechless. The vulgar thought it a pretence: and a jocose\nlady, where he was at tea with company, putting him as she said to a\ntrial, poured out a dish very strong and without sugar. He drank it and\nreturned the cup with a bow of great reserve, and his eye bent on the\nground: she then filled the cup with sugar, and pouring weak tea on it,\nsent it him: he drank that too, looked at her steadily, and blushed for\nher. The lady declared the man was dumb; the rest thought him perverse,\nand obstinate; but a constant and steady perseverance in an easy method\ncured him.\n\nAll these are miseries which the disease, while it retains its natural\nform, can bring upon the patient; and thus he will in time be worn out,\nand led miserably, though slowly, to the grave. Let him not indulge his\ninactivity so far as to give way to this, because it is represented as\nfar off; the disease may suddenly and frightfully change its nature; and\nswifter evils follow.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. IV. - The DANGER.\n\n\nWe have done with the obstruction considered in itself; but this, though\noften unsurmountable by art, at least by the methods now in use, will be\nsometimes broken through at once by nature, or by accidents; and bring\non fatal evils. These are strictly different diseases, and are no\notherway concerned here, than as the consequences of that of which we\nare treating.\n\nThe thick and glutinous blood which has so long stagnated in the spleen,\nwill have in that time altered its nature, and acquired a very great\ndegree of acrimony: while it lies dormant, this does no more mischiefs,\nthan those named already; but when violent exercise, a fit of outrageous\nanger, or any thing else that suddenly shocks and disturbs the frame,\nputs it in motion, it melts at once into a kind of liquid putrefaction.\n\nBeing now thin, it mixes itself readily with the blood again, and brings\non putrid fevers; destroys the substance of the spleen itself, or being\nthrown upon some other of the viscera, corrodes them, and leads on this\nway a swift and miserable death. If it fall upon the liver, its tender\npulpy substance is soon destroyed, jaundices beyond the help of art\nfirst follow, then dropsies and all their train of misery; if on lungs,\nconsumptions; if on the brain, convulsions, epilepsy, palsy, apoplexy;\nif on the surface, leprosy.\n\nThe intention of cure is to melt this coagulation softly, not to break\nit violently; and then to give it a very gentle passage through the\nbowels. There is no safe way for it to take but that; and even that when\nurged too far may bring on fatal dysenteries.\n\nLet none wonder at the sudden devastation which sometimes arises from\nthis long stagnant matter, when liquified too hastily: how long, how\nmany years the impacted matter will continue quiet in a schirrous tumour\nof the breast; but being once put in motion, whether from accident, or\nin the course of nature, what can describe; or what can stop its\nhavock!\n\nInstances of the other are too frequent. A nobleman the other day died\nparalytick: dissection shewed a spleen consumed by an abscess, formed\nfrom the dissolved matter of such an obstruction: and 'tis scarce longer\nsince, a learned gentleman, who had been several years lost to his\nfriends, by the extreams of a Hypochondriacal disorder, seem'd gradually\nwithout assistance to recover: but the lungs suffered while the spleen\nwas freed; and he died very soon of what is called a galloping\nconsumption.\n\nWhen the obstruction is great and of long continuance, if it be thus\nhastily moved, the consequence is, equally, a sudden and a miserable\ndeath, whether, like the matter of a cancer, it remains in its place; or\nlike that of a bad small pox, be thrown upon some other vital part.\n\nLet not the patient be too much alarmed; this is laid down to caution,\nnot to terrify him: it is fit he should know his danger, and attend to\nit; for the prevention is easy; and the cure, even of the most advanced\nstages, when undertaken by gentle means, is not at all impracticable: to\nassist the physician, let him look into himself, and recollect the\nsource of his complaint. This he may judge of from the following\nnotices.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. V. - The Causes of the HYPOCHONDRIASIS.\n\n\nThe obstruction which forms this disease, may take its origin from\ndifferent accidents: a fever ill cured has often caused it; or the\npiles, which had been used to discharge largely, ceasing; a marshy soil,\npoisoned with stagnant water, has given it to some persons; and altho'\nindolence and inactivity are oftenest at the root, yet it has arisen\nfrom too great exercise.\n\nReal grief has often brought it on; and even love, for sometimes that is\nreal. Study and fixed attention of the mind have been accused before;\nand add to these the stooping posture of the body, which most men use,\nthough none should use it, in writing and in reading. This has\ncontributed too much to it; but of all other things night studies are\nthe most destructive. The steady stillness, and dusky habit of all\nnature in those hours, enforce, encourage, and support that settled\ngloom, which rises from fixt thought; and sinks the body to the grave;\neven while it carries up the mind to heaven. He who would have his lamp\n        At midnight hour\n  Be seen in some high lonely tower,\nwill waste the flame of this unheeded life: and while he labours to\nunsphere the spirit of Plato will let loose his own.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VI. - The Cure of the HYPOCHONDRIASIS.\n\n\nLet him who would escape the mischiefs of an obstructed spleen, avoid\nthe things here named: and let him who suffers from the malady,\nendeavour to remember to which of them it has been owing; for half the\nhope depends upon that knowledge.\n\nNature has sometimes made a cure herself, and we should watch her ways;\nfor art never is so right as when it imitates her: sometimes the\npatient's own resolution has set him free. This is always in his power,\nand at all times will do wonders.\n\nThe bleeding of the piles, from nature's single efforts, has at once\ncured a miserable man; where their cessation was the cause of the\ndisorder. A leprosy has appeared upon the skin, and all the symptoms of\nthe former sickness vanished. This among the Jews happened often: both\ndiseases we know were common among them: and I have here seen something\nvery like it: Water-Dock has thrown out scorbutic eruptions, and all the\nformer symptoms of an Hypochondriacal disorder have disappeared:\nreturning indeed when these were unadvisedly struck in; but keeping off\nentirely when they were better treated. A natural purging unsuppressed\nhas sometimes done the same good office: but this is hazardous.\n\nIt is easy to be directed from such instances; only let us take the\nwhole along with us. Bleeding would have answered nature's purpose, if\nshe could not have opened of herself the h\u00e6morrhoidal vessels; but he\nwho should give medicines for that purpose, might destroy his patient by\ntoo great disturbance. If a natural looseness may perform the cure, so\nmay an artificial; when the original source of the disorder points that\nway. But these are helps that take place only in particular cases.\n\nThe general and universal method of cure must be by some mild and gently\nresolving medicine, under the influence of which the obstructing matter\nmay be voided that, or some other way with safety. The best season to\nundertake this is the autumn, but even here there must be caution.\n\nIn the first place, no strong evacuating remedy must be given; for that,\nby carrying off the thinner parts of the juices, will tend to thicken\nthe remainder; and certainly encrease the distemper. No acrid medicine\nmust be directed, for that may act too hastily, dissolve the impacted\nmatter at once, and let it loose, to the destruction of the sufferer; no\nantimonial, no mercurial, no martial preparation must be taken; in\nshort, no chymistry: nature is the shop that heaven has set before us,\nand we must seek our medicine there. The venerable ancients, who knew\nnot this new art, will lead us in the search; and (faithful relators as\nthey are of truth) will tell us whence we may deduce our hope; and what\nwe are to fear.\n\nBut prior to the course of any medicine, and as an essential to any good\nhope from it, the patient must prescribe himself a proper course of\nlife, and a well chosen diet: let us assist him in his choice; and speak\nof this first, as it comes first in order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VI. - Rules of Life for Hypochondriac Persons.\n\n\nAir and exercise, as they are the best preservers of health, and\ngreatest assistants in the cure of all long continued diseases, will\nhave their full effect in this; but there requires some caution in the\nchoice, and management of them. It is common to think the air of high\ngrounds best; but experience near home shews otherwise: the\nHypochondriac patient is always worse at Highgate even than in London.\n\nThe air he breathes should be temperate; not exposed to the utmost\nviolences of heat and cold, and the swift changes from one to the\nother; which are most felt on those high grounds. The side of a hill is\nthe best place for him: and though wet grounds are hurtful; yet let\nthere be the shade of trees, to tempt him often to a walk; and soften by\ntheir exhalation the over dryness of the air.\n\nThe exercise he takes should be frequent; but not violent. Motion\npreserves the firmness of the parts, and elasticity of the vessels; it\nprevents that aggregation of thick humours which he is most to fear. A\nsedentary life always produces weakness, and that mischief always\nfollows: weak eyes are gummy, weak lungs are clogged with phlegm, and\nweak bowels waste themselves in vapid diarrhoeas.\n\nLet him invite himself abroad, and let his friends invite him by every\ninnocent inducement. For me, I should advise above all other things the\nstudy of nature. Let him begin with plants: he will here find a\ncontinual pleasure, and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful\nthings; even of the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to\nwalk; and every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket,\nwill afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually\nin the air, and continually to change the nature and quality of the air,\nby visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the lawn, the\nheath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be abroad; and the\nunceasing variety of the subjects of his observation, will prevent his\nwalking hastily: he will pursue his studies in the air; and that\ncontemplative turn of mind, which in his closet threatened his\ndestruction, will thus become the great means of his recovery.\n\nIf the mind tire upon this, from the repeated use, another of nature's\nkingdoms opens itself at once upon him; the plant he is weary of\nobserving, feeds some insect he may examine; nor is there a stone that\nlies before his foot, but may afford instruction and amusement.\n\nEven what the vulgar call the most abject things will shew a wonderful\nutility; and lead the mind, in pious contemplation higher than the\nstars. The poorest moss that is trampled under foot, has its important\nuses: is it at the bottom of a wood we find it? why there it shelters\nthe fallen seeds; hides them from birds, and covers them from frost;\nand thus becomes the foster father of another forest! creeps it along\nthe surface of a rock? even there its good is infinite! its small roots\nrun into the stone, and the rains make their way after them; the moss\nhaving lived its time dies; it rots and with the mouldered fragments of\nthe stone forms earth; wherein, after a few successions, useful plants\nmay grow, and feed more useful cattle!\n\nIs there a weed more humble in its aspect, more trampled on, or more\ndespised than knot grass! no art can get the better of its growth, no\nlabour can destroy it; 'twere pity if they could, for the thing lives\nwhere nothing would of use to us; and its large and most wonderfully\nabundant seeds, feed in hard winters, half the birds of Heaven.\n\nWhat the weak moss performs upon the rock the loathed toadstool brings\nabout in timber: is an oak dead where man's eye will not find it? this\nfungus roots itself upon the bark, and rots the wood beneath it; hither\nthe beetle creeps for shelter, and for sustenance; him the woodpecker\nfollows as his prey; and while he tears the tree in search of him, he\nscatters it about the ground; which it manures.\n\nNor is it the beetle alone that thus insinuates itself into the\nsubstance of the vegetable tribe: the tender aphide, whom a touch\ndestroys, burrows between the two skins of a leaf, for shelter from his\nwinged enemies; tracing, with more than Dedal\u00e6an art, his various\nmeanders; and veining the green surface with these white lines more\nbeautifully than the best \u00c6gyptian marble.\n\n'Twere endless to proceed; nor is it needful: one object will not fail\nto lead on to another, and every where the goodness of his God will\nshine before him even in what are thought the vilest things; his\ngreatness in the lead of them.\n\nLet him pursue these thoughts, and seek abroad the objects and the\ninstigations to them: but let him in these and all other excursions\navoid equally the dews of early morning, and of evening.\n\nThe more than usual exercise of this prescription will dispose him to\nmore than customary sleep, let him indulge it freely; so far from\nhurting, it will help his cure.\n\nLet him avoid all excesses: drink need scarce be named, for we are\nwriting to men of better and of nobler minds, than can be tempted to\nthat humiliating vice. Those who in this disorder have too great an\nappetite, must not indulge it; much eaten was never well digested: but\nof all excesses the most fatal in this case is that of venery. It is the\nexcess we speak of.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VII. - The proper DIET.\n\n\nIn the first place acids must be avoided carefully; and all things that\nare in a state of fermentation, for they will breed acidity. Provisions\nhardened by salting never should be tasted; much less those cured by\nsmoaking, and by salting. Bacon is indigestible in an Hypochondriac\nstomach; and hams, impregnated as is now the custom, with acid fumes\nfrom the wood fires over which they are hung, have that additional\nmischief.\n\nMilk ought to be a great article in the diet: and even in this there\nshould be choice. The milk of grass-fed cows has its true quality: no\nother. There are a multitude of ways in which this may be made a part\nboth of our foods and drinks, and they should all be used.\n\nThe great and general caution is that the diet be at all times of a kind\nloosening and gently stimulating; light but not acrid. Veal, lamb,\nfowls, lobsters, crabs, craw-fish, fresh water fish and mutton broth,\nwith plenty of boiled vegetables, are always right; and give enough\nvariety.\n\nRaw vegetables are all bad: sour wines, old cheese, and bottled beer are\nthings never to be once tasted. Indeed much wine is wrong, be it of what\nkind soever. It is the first of cordials; and as such I would have it\ntaken in this disease when it is wanted: plainly as a medicine, rather\nthan a part of diet. Malt liquor carefully chosen is certainly the best\ndrink. This must be neither new, nor tending to sourness; perfectly\nclear, and of a moderate strength: it is the native liquor of our\ncountry, and the most healthful.\n\nToo much tea weakens; and even sugar is in this disorder hurtful: but\nhoney may supply its place in most things; and this is not only harmless\nbut medicinal; a very powerful dissolvent of impacted humours, and a\ngreat deobstruent.\n\nWhat wine is drank should be of some of the sweet kinds. Old Hock has\nbeen found on enquiry to yield more than ten times the acid of the sweet\nwines; and in red Port, at least in what we are content to call so,\nthere is an astringent quality, that is most mischievous in these cases:\nit is said there is often alum in it: how pregnant with mischief that\nmust be to persons whose bowels require to be kept open, is most\nevident. Summer fruits perfectly ripe are not only harmless but\nmedicinal; but if eaten unripe they will be very prejudicial. A light\nsupper, which will leave an appetite for a milk breakfast, is always\nright; this will not let the stomach be ravenous for dinner, as it is\napt to be in those who make that their only meal.\n\nOne caution more must be given, and it may seem a strange one: it is\nthat the patient attend regularly to his hours of eating. We have to do\nwith men for the most part whose soul is the great object of their\nregard; but let them not forget they have a body.\n\nThe late Dr. STUKELY has told me, that one day by appointment visiting\nSir ISAAC NEWTON, the servant told him, he was in his study. No one was\npermitted to disturb him there; but as it was near dinner time, the\nvisitor sat down to wait for him. After a time dinner was brought in; a\nboil'd chicken under a cover. An hour pass'd, and Sir ISAAC did not\nappear. The doctor eat the fowl, and covering up the empty dish, bad\nthem dress their master another. Before that was ready, the great man\ncame down; he apologiz'd for his delay, and added, \"give me but leave to\ntake my short dinner, and I shall be at your service; I am fatigued and\nfaint.\" Saying this, he lifted up the cover; and without any emotion,\nturned about to STUKELY with a smile; \"See says he, what we studious\npeople are, I forgot I had din'd.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VIII. - The MEDICINE.\n\n\n'Tis the ill fate of this disease, more than of all others to be\nmisunderstood at first, and thence neglected; till the physician shakes\nhis head at a few first questions. None steals so fatally upon the\nsufferer: its advances are by very slow degrees; but every day it grows\nmore difficult of cure.\n\nThat this obstruction in the spleen is the true malady, the cases\nrelated by the antients, present observation, and the unerring\ntestimonies of dissections leave no room to doubt. Being understood, the\npath is open where to seek a remedy: and our best guides in this, as in\nthe former instance, will be those venerable Greeks; who saw a thousand\nof these cases, where we see one; and with less than half our theory,\ncured twice as many patients.\n\nOne established doctrine holds place in all these writers; that whatever\nby a hasty fermentation dissolves the impacted matter of the\nobstruction, and sends it in that state into the blood, does incredible\nmischief: but that whatever medicine softens it by slow degrees, and, as\nit melts, delivers it to the bowels without disturbance; will cure with\nequal certainty and safety.\n\nFor this good purpose, they knew and tried a multitude of herbs; but in\nthe end they fixed on one: and on their repeated trials of this, they\nbanished all the rest. This stood alone for the cure of the disease; and\nfrom its virtue received the name of SPLEEN-WORT. O wise and happy\nGreeks! authors of knowledge and perpetuators of it! With them the very\nname they gave a plant declared its virtues: with us, a writer calls a\nplant from some friend; that the good gardener who receives the honour,\nmay call another by his name who gave it. We now add the term smooth\nto this herb, to distinguish it from another, called by the same general\nterm, though not much resembling it.\n\nThe virtues of this smooth Spleen-wort have flood the test of ages; and\nthe plant every where retained its name and credit: and one of our good\nherbalists, who had seen a wonderful case of a swoln spleen, so big, and\nhard as to be felt with terror, brought back to a state of nature by it;\nand all the miserable symptoms vanish; thought Spleen-wort not enough\nexpressive of its excellence; but stamp'd on it the name of MILT-WASTE.\n\nIn the Greek Islands now, the use of it is known to every one; and even\nthe lazy monks who take it, are no longer splenetic. In the west of\nEngland, the rocks are stripped of it with diligence; and every old woman\ntells you how charming that leaf is for bookish men: in Russia they use\na plant of this kind in their malt liquor: it came into fashion there\nfor the cure of this disease; which from its constant use is scarce\nknown any longer; and they suppose 'tis added to their liquor for a\nflavour.\n\nThe ancients held it in a kind of veneration; and used what has been\ncalled a superstition in the gathering it. It was to be taken up with a\nsharp knife, without violence, and laid upon the clean linen: no time\nbut the still darkness of the night was proper, and even the moon was\nnot to shine upon it. I know they have been ridiculed for this; for\nnothing is so vain as learned ignorance: but let me be permitted once to\nvindicate them.\n\nThe plant has leaves that can close in their sides; and their under part\nis covered thick with a yellow powder, consisting of the seeds, and seed\nvessels: in these they knew the virtue most resided: this was the golden\ndust they held so valuable; and this they knew they could not be too\ncautious to preserve. They were not ignorant of the sleep of plants; a\nmatter lately spoken of by some, as if a new discovery; and being\nsensible that light, a dry air, an expanded leaf, and a tempestuous\nseason, were the means of losing this fine dust; and knowing also that\ndarkness alone brought on that closing of the leaf which thence has\nbeen called sleep; and which helped to defend and to secure it, they\ntherefore took such time, and used such means as could best preserve the\nplant entire; and even save what might be scattered from it.--And now\nwhere is their superstition?\n\nFrom this plant thus collected they prepared a medicine, which in a\ncourse of forty days scarce ever failed to make a perfect cure.\n\nWe have the plant wild with us; and till the fashion of rough chemical\npreparations took off our attention from these gentler remedies, it was\nin frequent use and great repute. I trust it will be so again: and many\nthank me for restoring it to notice.\n\nSpleen-wort gives out its virtues freely in a tincture; and a small dose\nof this, mixing readily with the blood and juices, gradually dissolves\nthe obstruction; and by a little at a time delivers its contents to be\nthrown off without pain, from the bowels. Let this be done while the\nviscera are yet sound and the cure is perfect. More than the forty days\nof the Greek method is scarce ever required; much oftener two thirds of\nthat time suffice; and every day, from the first dose of it, the patient\nfeels the happy change that is growing in his constitution. His food no\nmore turns putrid on his stomach, but yields its healthful nourishment.\n\nThe swelling after meals therefore vanishes; and with that goes the\nlowness, and anxiety, the difficult breath, and the distracting cholick:\nhe can bear the approach of rainy weather without pain; he finds himself\nmore apt for motion, and ready to take that exercise which is to be\nassistant in his cure; life seems no longer burthensome. His bowels get\ninto the natural condition of health, and perform their office once at\nleast a day; better if a little more: the dull and dead colour of his\nskin goes off, his lips grow red again, and every sign of health\nreturns.\n\nLet him who takes the medicine, say whether any thing here be\nexaggerated. Let him, if he pleases to give himself the trouble, talk\nover with me, or write to me, this gradual decrease of his complaints,\nas he proceeds in his cure. My uncertain state of health does not\npermit me to practise physic in the usual way, but I am very desirous to\ndo what good I can, and shall never refuse my advice, such as it may be,\nto any person rich or poor, in whatever manner he may apply for it. I\nshall refer him to no apothecary, whose bills require he should be\ndrenched with potions; but tell him, in this as in all other cases,\nwhere to find some simple herb; which he may if he please prepare\nhimself; or if he had rather spare that trouble, may have it so prepared\nfrom me.\n\nWith regard to Spleen-wort, no method of using it is more effectual than\nsimply taking it in powder; the only advantage of a tincture, is that a\nproper dose may be given, and yet the stomach not be loaded with so\nlarge a quantity: it is an easier and pleasanter method, and nothing\nmore.\n\nIf any person choose to take it in the other way, I should still wish\nhim once at least to apply to me; that he may be assured what he is\nabout to take is the right plant. Abuses in medicines are at this time\nvery great, and in no instance worse than what relates to herbs. The\nbest of our physicians have complained upon this head with warmth, but\nwithout redress: they know the virtues and the value of many of our\nnative plants, but dread to prescribe them; lest some wrong thing should\nbe administered in their place; perhaps inefficacious, perhaps\nmischievous, nay it may be fatal. The few simple things I direct are\nalways before me; and it will at all times be a pleasure to me, in this\nand any other instance, to see whether what any person is about to take\nbe right. I have great obligations to the public, and this is the best\nreturn that I know how to make.\n\nTo see the need of such a caution, hear a transaction but of yesterday!\n\nAn intelligent person was directed to go to the medicinal herb shops in\nthe several markets, and buy some of this Spleen-wort; the name was\nwritten, and shewn to every one; every shop received his money, and\nalmost every one sold a different plant, under the name of this: but\nwhat is very striking, not one of them the right. Such is the chance of\nhealth in those hands through which the best means of it usually pass;\neven in the most regular course of application.\n\nI would not be understood to limit the little services I may this way be\nable to render the afflicted, to this single instance; much less to\npropose to myself any advantages from it. Whoever pleases will be\nwelcome to me, upon any such occasion; and whatever be the herb on which\nhe places a dependance, he shall be shewn it growing. I once recommended\na garden to be established for this use, at the public expence: one\ngreat person has put it in my power to answer all its purposes.\n\n                        F  I  N  I  S.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris, he was\n\"nominated\" to the Academy. He had but to present an Historical\nPainting in order to take his seat as an Academician.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VENUS AND MARRIAGE\n\n\nBack in his beloved Paris again; thrilled by the atmosphere and gaiety\nof its merry life; in the full vigour of manhood on the eve of his\nthirties; amongst congenial friends; done with the drudgery of winning\nto Academic honour, Boucher saw that the public were not falling over\neach other to purchase religious or historic pictures; he straightway\nturned his back upon these things, and on the edge of his thirtieth\nyear he gave to the world his \"Marriage of the Children of God with\nthe Children of Men,\" in which Venus is the avowed mistress of his\nadoration. It caused a fine stir, and greatly increased his repute.\n\nIn this picture he ends his Italian period and strikes his own\npersonal note. Both this and the \"Venus asking arms for Aeneas from\nVulcan,\" together with the \"Birth of Adonis\" and the \"Death of\nAdonis,\" of about the same period, still show Boucher strongly under\nthe influence of his master, Lemoyne. Indeed, the \"Birth\" and \"Death\nof Adonis,\" their record lost during the scuffle and confusion of the\nRevolution, for long hung side by side as pictures by Lemoyne, until,\nbeing cleaned about 1860, Boucher's initials were discovered upon\nthem, and, contemporary engravings being hunted up, still further\nproved their origin. But in the Venus that now figures in all his\nworks there is that flesh-painting of the nude, and that rosy touch\nupon the flesh of the female figure, that are a far more certain\nsignature of Boucher's handiwork than any written name.\n\nUnfortunately the Salons were closed during Boucher's earlier years\nuntil he was thirty-four, and the record of his work during these\nyears is difficult to follow; but with his service to Venus his\npersonal career begins, and the stream of his Venus-pieces steadily\nflows from his hands.\n\nHe came to her service rid of all prentice essays in craftsmanship, a\nfinished and consummate artist. He found in his subject a goddess to\nwhom he could devote his great and splendid gifts. He painted her\ndainty body with a radiant delight and a rare colour-sense such as\nFrance had never before seen or uttered. He remains to this day the\nfirst painter of the subtle, delicate, and elusive thing that is\nfemininity; he caught her allure, her charm, as he was to catch the\nfragrance and charm of children and flowers; and he set the statement\nof these things upon canvas as they have never been uttered.\n\nThe whole of his life long, Boucher gave himself up with equal and\npassionate devotion to work and to pleasure--working at his easel\noften twelve hours of his day without losing, to the end when the\nbrush fell from his dead fingers, his blitheness of heart or his\ngenerosity of act, and without weakening the pleasure-loving desires\nof his gadding spirit. Out of his splendid toil he made the means to\nindulge his tastes for pleasure; and the gratifying of his tastes in\nturn renewed and created the ideas that made the subjects of his\nartistry. He brought to all he did a joy in the doing that made of his\nvast labour one long pleasure--of his pleasures a riot of industry. He\nplayed as he toiled, scarce knowing which was play and which toil.\n\nThe gossip of his love-affairs makes no romantic story--they were but\ncommonplace ecstasies with unknown frail women. But hard as he worked\nand lived and played, he found time to get himself married in his\nthirtieth year to pretty seventeen-year-old Marie Jeanne Buseau, a\nlittle Parisian--and for love of her, so far as he understood the\nbusiness; for she brought him no dowry.\n\nThe young couple settled down for the next ten years in the Rue\nSaint-Thomas-du-Louvre. Here Boucher lived through his thirties.\n\nMadame was a pretty creature, if we had but Latour's pastel portrait\nalone to prove it. But the pretty features were the crown to as pretty\na body, for she sat often to her lord; and it is clear from his\ncorrespondence with a friend, Bachaumont, that she is the Psyche of\nhis illustrated fable--and Psyche runs much to the Altogether.\n\nMarriage, however, was not likely to imprison Boucher's gadding eyes;\nand it did not. Madame Boucher seems to have had as frail a heart, and\navoided strife by amusing herself, amongst others, with the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who, to gain access to the lady,\ncommissioned Boucher to do the Watteau-like illustrations to\nAcajou--a dull affair. Boucher's pretty wife, herself no mean\nartist, worked in his studio, and painted several smaller canvases\nafter his pictures, gaining some fame as a miniaturist and engraver.\n\nNor did Marriage turn Boucher from his art. Two years were gone by\nsince his nomination to the Academy; he had now to paint the formal\nHistorical Picture and present it in order to take his seat as\nAcademician; and it was in this his thirtieth year that he painted and\nwon his academic rank with the \"Renauld et Armide\" now at the Louvre.\n\nHere he sufficiently subordinated his own style to the academic to\nensure success; and the work was hailed by Academicians and critics,\nincluding Diderot, with enthusiasm. But even here we have his cupids\npeeping round the mythologic event; and Armide herself has pretty\nFrench lips that knew no Greek.\n\nOnce secure of his position, he straightway flung the last remnants of\nthe academic style out of his studio door; and it is a grim comment on\ncriticism that it was just exactly in proportion as he developed his\nown personal genius and uttered the France of his day, that he was\nattacked; whilst the stilted things that he knew were third-rate, and\nwhich he wholly rejected from henceforth, were exactly the things that\nwere praised!\n\nHis election to the Academy, and the enthusiasm over the picture that\nwon him his seat thereat, brought his name before the young king; the\nfollowing year he received his first order from the Court whose\npainter he was destined to become. The decorations in the queen's\napartments were gloomy and had grown black; and he painted in their\nstead the \"Charity,\" \"Abundance,\" \"Fidelity,\" and \"Prudence\" still\nthere to be seen. Indeed, with his gay vision, his pretty habit of\nculling only the flowers from the garden of life, and his quickness to\nset down the pleasing thing in every prospect, Boucher was the\ndestined painter of a Court weary of pomposity and the pose of the\nmock-heroic, and which was wholly giving itself up to pleasure and the\nelegances.\n\nBut neither his new dignity of Academician nor the royal favour, kept\nhim from the bookshops; and he illustrated, with rare beauty and a\ncharm worthy of Watteau, the great edition of the Works of Moli\u00e8re\nin his thirty-first year. It is true that he made as free with\nMoli\u00e8re's world as with the Gods of Olympus; he peoples the plays with\ncharacters of his own day, arrayed in the dress and habit of that day,\nand moving in surroundings that he saw about him.\n\n\nLE MONDE QUI S'AMUSE\n\n\nThe Homely had come upon the town out of Holland, painted with most\nconsummate artistry by Chardin, and was soon in the vogue. Boucher had\na quick eye for the mode. And he straightway set himself to the\npainting of \"La Belle Cuisini\u00e8re.\" Still-life and homely subjects need\nan accuracy of realism and a Dutch sense of these things, a sense of\nsincerity and an appreciation of the dignity of the work-a-day life of\nthe people, in which Boucher was wholly lacking. Above all, it calls\nfor a sense of \"character,\" which, in Boucher, was always weak. It was\na sneer against him that his very broomsticks called for pompons and\nribbons--and there was more than a little truth in the spite. He is\nmore concerned with the accident of the kissing of a kitchen-maid than\nwith the kitchen's habit. He cannot even peep into a scullery without\ndragging in Venus by the skirts, and tricking her out in a\nproperty-wardrobe of a scullery-wench, in which the girl is clearly\nbut acting the part.\n\nHowever, these passing vogues and experiments in different methods\nwere only gay asides--he was working the while upon his own subjects;\nand, to the display by its several members ordered by the Academy, he\nsent four little paintings of fauns and cupids which won him the\nhonour of election as deputy-professor. His brain and hand were very\nbusy, and he turns from one thing to another with amazing facility,\nbringing distinction to all that he does.\n\nBut he painted about this time two pictures of infants, \"L'Amour\nOiseleur\" and \"L'Amour Moissonneur,\" which were the beginning of that\nhost of cupids that he let fly from his studio; they frolic across his\ncanvases and join the retinue of Venus, peeping out from clouds, over\nwaves, round curtains, painted with a perfection that has never been\nsurpassed in the portrayal of infants. He painted their round limbs,\ntheir lusty life, their delightful awkwardnesses, their jolly fat\ngrace, their na\u00efve surprise at life and glory in it, as they had never\nbeen painted before, and have never been painted since.\n\nHe also gave forth in this his thirty-third year a \"Pastoral\" and a\n\"Shepherd and Shepherdess in Conversation,\" with sheep about them and\nin a pleasant landscape, which were his first essays in the style that\nhe created and which made him famous.\n\nHis friend Meissonnier, the inventor of the rococo, stood godfather to\nBoucher's first-born son in the May of 1736.\n\nFrom the very beginning Boucher seems to have been engraved. And these\nengravings, done by the best gravers of his day, greatly extended his\nreputation and popularised him; he fully realised the value of the\nadvertisement as well as his profits from it. Before his thirty-third\nyear was run out he published his well-known \"Cries of Paris.\"\n\nBoucher's description of them, \"studies from the low classes,\" holds\nthe key to that something of failure to realise the dramatic verities\nthat is over all; it gives also the attitude of the France that he\nknew towards the France that he did not, and could not understand. He\ncreated that dainty, pleasant atmosphere that comes floating up to the\nwindows on a fresh morning in Paris from the musical cries of\nthe street vendors; but of the deeper significance of the\nstreet-sellers--of the miserable accent in their life, of their weary\ntoil, of the dignity of their labour--he knew nothing; his brush could\nnot refrain from making elegance and fine manners peep from behind the\nstreet-porter's fustian or the milkmaid's skirt.\n\nBut his thirty-third year was to contain a more far-reaching\nsignificance even than the creation of his cupid-pieces and pastorals.\n\nThe \"Cries of Paris\" were scarce printed when Boucher's illustration\nto \"Don Quixote\" appeared--\"Sancho pursued by the servants of the\nDuke.\" This design was to have far-reaching results that Boucher\nlittle suspected.\n\nThe painter Oudry had been called to the conduct of the great tapestry\nlooms at Beauvais a couple of years before; and in his efforts to\nfurnish the looms with good designs, he now called Boucher to his aid,\nwhose original and fresh style, colour, and arrangement, together with\nhis personal vision, and the enthusiasm and zeal with which he threw\nhimself into the work, at once increased the reputation and the\nproducts of the famous looms. This large designing for the tapestries\nwas, in return, of immense value to the development of the genius of\nthe man, enlarging his breadth of style and giving scope to that great\ndecorative sense that was his superb gift. Thenceforth he was destined\nto play a supreme part in the history of the world-famed factories. He\nnow produced painting after painting for the Beauvais looms.\n\nLife is now one long triumph for Boucher, only disturbed in this year\nby the sad news of the suicide of his old master, Lemoyne. It was in\nthis, Boucher's thirty-fourth year, that the Salon was opened for the\nfirst time since Boucher's infancy, and he contributed several\ncanvases to it.\n\nRigaud, the old Academician, now close upon eighty, straggling through\nthe great galleries, might well blink and gasp at the change that had\ncome over French art since he last exhibited there, thirty-three years\ngone by; but his scoffs and regrets held no terrors for the younger\nAcademicians gathered about. He stood in a new world. A new generation\nwas in possession. The grand manner, the severe etiquette, formal\nmock-heroics, and solemn pomposity of Louis the Fourteenth were\nvanished, and the Agreeable and the Pleasant Make-Believe of Louis the\nFifteenth reigned in their stead. Old Rigaud might blink indeed! Just\nas the imposing and stilted etiquette of the reception-room had given\nplace to the easy manners and airy etiquette of the dainty boudoir, so\nhad light chatter and gay wit and the quick repartee usurped the heavy\nsplendours of a consequential age. France, weary of an eternal pose of\nthe grand manner, was seeking change in joyousness and amusement.\n\nGallantry and gaiety were become the object of the ambition of a\ndandified and elegant day. France became a coquette; dressed herself\nas a porcelain shepherdess; and with beribboned crook and sheep,\nseeking pleasant prospects to stroll through, gave herself to\ndalliance--her powder-puff and patch-box and fan a serious part of her\nunseriousness.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE CH\u00c2TEAUROUX\n\n\nAt thirty-five Boucher has arrived. He is in the vogue; in favour at\nCourt--as well as in the fashion. In his three years from taking his\nseat at the Academy to the opening of the first Salon he has created a\nnew and original style--his cupid pieces, his pastorals, his\nVenus-pieces, his tapestry. Boucher's kingdom lay in the realm of the\ndecorative painter--and he has found it. Torn from the surroundings\nfor which he designed them, as part and parcel of the general scheme,\nhis pictures are as out of place as an Italian altarpiece in an\nEnglish dining-room, yet they suffer less. Several may still be seen,\nas he set them up in frames of his own planning, as overdoors in the\npalace of the Soubise, now given up to the national archives.\n\nThe ghost of the Prince of Soubise, who commissioned them, may haunt\nhis palace, but his kin know the place no longer. The overdoors\nwrought by Boucher's skill look down now on the nation's collection of\nhistoric documents. The \"Three Graces enchaining Love,\" the fine\npastoral of \"The Cage,\" and the pastoral of the \"Shepherd placing a\nRose in his Shepherdess's Hair,\" were to see a mightier change than\nthe usurpation of Louis the Fourteenth's pompous age by the elegant\nyears of Louis the Fifteenth. But this was not as yet. Here at least\nwe see Boucher's art rid of all outside influences, and at the full\ntide of creation; here we have the inimitable lightness of touch, the\nfigures and landscape bathed in the airy volume of atmosphere.\n\nHe seems at this time to have played with pastel, due probably to his\nfriendship with Latour, who sent a portrait of Boucher's wife to this\nSalon. Boucher showed in the use of chalks the artistry and skill that\nwere always at his command.\n\nHe also was putting to its full use his innate sense of landscape,\nraising to high achievement that astonishing balance of landscape and\nfigures in his design--a balance that has never been surpassed; his\nfigures never override his landscape; his landscape never overpowers\nhis figures. His earnest counsels to his pupils and his constant\ndeploring of the lack of the landscape art in France prove the great\nstress he laid upon it.\n\nThe designing of a frontispiece for the catalogue of a personal\nfriend, one Gersaint, a merchant of oriental wares, started Boucher in\nhis thirty-third year upon that series of Chinese pictures and\ntapestries known as the \"Chinoiseries,\" in which he frittered away\nonly too many precious hours, for they were received with great favour\nby the public. The paintings of Chinese subjects designed for the\nlooms of Beauvais are still to be seen at Besan\u00e7on.\n\nBut busy as were his brain and hand in the exercise of his wide and\nversatile gifts, pouring out \"Chinoiseries,\" illustrations for books,\ntapestries on a large scale, landscapes, models for the gilt bronze\ndecorations of porcelain vases, scheming handsome frames for his\npictures, designing furniture and fans--Boucher was true, above all,\n\"to his goddess,\" and painted the famed \"Birth of Venus,\" which,\nthanks to the Swedish Ambassador's fondness for Madame Boucher, now\nhangs at Stockholm; our amorous Count de Tessin, to be just, seems to\nhave had a rare flair for the artistic--besides artist's wives. It was\non the 15th of April in 1742, the last year of his thirties, that the\nRoyal favour was marked by the grant of a pension of 400 livres\n(double florins) to Boucher with promise of early benefits to follow.\n\nTwo years afterwards it was raised to 600 livres.\n\nThis was the year that he painted the beautiful canvas of \"Diana\nleaving the Bath with one of her Companions,\" now at the Louvre. It\nwas also the year that saw his landscape, the \"Hamlet of Iss\u00e9\" at the\nSalon. This \"Hameau d'Iss\u00e9\" was to be enlarged for the Opera, proving\nhim to be decorator there, where he was arranging waterfalls,\ncascades, and the rest of the pretty business, without staying his\nhand from his art.\n\nAt forty Boucher has come into his kingdom. The ten years of these\nforties were to be a vast triumph for him. He was to produce\nmasterpiece after masterpiece. His art had caught the taste of the\nday. He was at the height of his powers. He had done great things--he\nwas to do greater. During these ten years of his forties he poured\nforth vivid and glowing works of sustained power and originality.\n\nWe have a picture of him as he was in the flesh at this time--the\npastel portrait by Lundberg, now at the Louvre--a gay, somewhat\ndissipated, handsomely dressed dandy of the time, smiling out of his\ncareless day, the debonnair man of fashion, the laughing eyes showing\nsigns of the night carousals, which were the rest from the prodigious\ntoil of this vital and forthright spirit.\n\nIt was in this our artist's fortieth year that the gifted old Cardinal\nFleury, who had guided the fortunes of France with rare skill, died,\nbroken by his ninety years and the blunders of the disastrous war that\nhe had so strenuously opposed; and Louis, essaying the strut of\nkingship, became king by act. His indolent character, unequal to the\nmighty business, his indeterminate will fretted by the set of\nquarrelling and intriguing rogues that he gathered about him as his\nministers, he fell into the habit that became his thenceforth, the\nonly thing to which he paid the tribute of constancy--he ruled France\nfrom behind pretty petticoats. He had early shown the adulterous blood\nof his great-grandfather; two, if not three, of five sisters of the\nnoble and historic house of De Nesle had yielded to his gadding fancy;\nthe youngest now ousted her sister De Mailly from the king's favour,\nwas publicly acknowledged as the king's mistress, and became Duchess\nof Ch\u00e2teauroux. Boucher painted her handsome being as a shepherdess in\none of his pastorals. She was no ordinary toy of a king. A woman of\ntalent, with hot ambitions for the king's majesty, fired with the\npride of race of the old French noblesse, it was during her short\nyears of ascendancy over the king that he roused from his body's\ntorpor and made an effort to reach the dignity and eminence befitting\nto the lord of a great and gallant people. He stepped forth awhile\nfrom his drunken bouts and manifold mean adulteries, and set himself\nat the head of the army in Flanders, and strutted it as conqueror.\n\nPoor Ch\u00e2teauroux only got the hate of the people for reward, Louis the\nhonours; for the people resented the public dishonour of her state.\n\nPower she found to be a dead-sea apple in her pretty mouth. The glory\nof it all, the splendours, were not the easily won delights for which\nshe had looked. She had to fight a duel, that never ended, with the\nking's witty, crafty, and scurrilous Prime Minister, the notorious\nMaurepas--and Maurepas willed that no woman should ever come between\nhim and the king--Maurepas who knew no mercy, no decency, no chivalry,\nno scruple. At Ch\u00e2teauroux's urging, Louis placed himself at the\nhead of the army; and France went near mad with joy that she had\nagain found a king. Crafty Maurepas urged on the business; the\nCh\u00e2teauroux suddenly realised his cunning glee--it separated her from\nthe king.\n\nOut of the whirl of things Boucher's fortune was ripening, little as\nhe might suspect it.\n\nHe was painting masterpieces that make his name live. To his fortieth\nyear belong the famed \"Birth of Venus,\" the \"Venus leaving the Bath,\"\nthe \"Muse Clio,\" the \"Muse Melpomene,\" and the three well-known\npastorals now at the Louvre--\"The Sleeping Shepherdess,\" the \"Nest,\"\n\n\nand the \"Shepherd and Shepherdesses.\" Of the many famous Venus-pieces\nthat his hand painted during these years it is not easy to write the\nlist. But having signed the \"Marriage of Love and Psyche\" at\nforty-one, he turned his experimental hand to the homely, realistic\nDutch style that was having a wide vogue, and painted the\n\"Dejeuner\"--a family of the prosperous class of the day at\nbreakfast--showing with rare charm the surroundings and home life of\nthe well-to-do of his time.\n\nAll goes well with Boucher. He changes into better quarters in the Rue\nde Grenelle-Saint-Honor\u00e9, where he lived for the next five years,\nuntil 1749; but his eyes are fixed upon a studio and apartments at\nthe old palace of the Louvre, though the hard intriguing of his\npowerful friends at Court on his behalf failed for some time. He had,\nindeed, to make another move before he arrived at his longed-for goal.\n\nPensions Boucher, like others, had found to be somewhat empty affairs;\nbut rooms at the Louvre were a solid possession eagerly sought after\nby the artists.\n\nIn this year of 1744 Boucher created a new fashion at the annual Salon\nby sending studies and sketches instead of finished pictures; and it\nset a value upon such things not before realised by artists, for\nsuccess was instant and loud.\n\nTowards the end of the next, Boucher's forty-second year, the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who was to take his leave of Paris,\ncommissioned four pictures to represent the day of a woman of fashion,\nand to be entitled \"Morning,\" \"Midday,\" \"Evening,\" and \"Night.\"\n\nBoucher painted one of these for him, now known as the \"Marchande de\nModes.\" The others were painted later, and all had a wide vogue as\nengravings. The correspondence has interest since it reveals Boucher's\nbusiness habits; he was paid for a picture on its delivery, and for\neach of these he was to receive 600 livres (double florins or\ndollars)--about a hundred and twenty pounds.\n\nIn an official document of the Director of Buildings to the king (or\nMinister of Fine Art, as we should say), written in this year of 1745,\nBoucher being forty-two, is a \"list of the best painters,\" in which\nBoucher is singled out for distinction as \"an historic painter, living\nin the Rue de Grenelle-Saint-Honor\u00e9, opposite the Rue des Deux-Ecus,\npupil of Lemoyne, excelling also in landscape, grotesques, and\nornaments in the manner of Watteau; and equally skilled in painting\nflowers, fruit, architecture, and subjects of gallantry and of\nfashion.\"\n\nNot so bad for dry officialdom; the critics could learn a lesson. For\nhe was nothing less. What indeed does he not do? and wondrous well!\nthis painter of the age.\n\nAnd the mighty rush of events is about to sweep him into further\nprominence; the very things which he probably passed by with a gay\nshrug are to enrich him, to help him to his highest fulfilment.\n\nPoor Ch\u00e2teauroux saw that she must lose the king's gadding favour in\nthe conflict with Maurepas unless she joined her lord, now with the\narmy. She realised full well that she had created the new Louis of\nAmbition--that her going must bring the people's hate to her. But she\ndared not lose the king. And she went. Maurepas had overdone his\njibings. The indiscretion at once rang through the land; became the\njest of the army--and Maurepas was not far from the bottom of the\nbusiness. The discreet indiscretion of covered ways between the king's\nlodgings and hers only added to the mockeries, and increased the\npeople's hate against, of course, the Ch\u00e2teauroux. Then upon a day in\nAugust the small-pox seized Louis at Metz; poor Ch\u00e2teauroux fought for\npossession of the king in the sick room, until his fear of\ndeath--Louis' sole piety--sent her packing--shrinking back in the\nhired carriage at each halting-place for change of horses, lest she\nshould be seen and torn from her place and destroyed by the populace.\n\nBut Louis recovered; Paris rang with bells at joy on his recovery, and\nhe entered the city amidst mad enthusiasm, hailed as The Well-Beloved.\n\nHe sent for the Ch\u00e2teauroux to find her dying, Maurepas having to\ndeliver the message of recall. She died suddenly and in great agony,\nswearing that Maurepas had poisoned her--died in the arms of her poor\ndiscarded sister, the De Mailly.\n\nBut this year of 1745 Boucher hears a mightier scandal that is to mean\nvast things to all France--and not least of all to Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE POMPADOUR\n\n\nA young bride had become the gossip of the rich merchant society of\nParis--that class that was ousting the old noblesse from power. She\nwas a beautiful, a remarkable woman; her wit was repeated in the\ndrawing-rooms, she had all the accomplishments; her charming\nname--Madame Lenormant d'Etioles.\n\nDraw aside the curtains of the past and we discover our little Jeanne\nPoisson--grown into this exquisite creature. It has come about in\nstrange fashion enough. The father--a scandalous fellow--having\nfingered the commissariat moneys in ugly ways to his own use, had been\nbanished for the ugly business. Nor is Jeanne's mother any better than\nshe should be; and the wags wink knowingly at the handsome and rich\nman of fashion, Monsieur Lenormant de Tournehem, who has been the\nfavoured gallant during the absence of the light-fingered Poisson.\n\nAnd, of a truth, Lenormant de Tournehem takes astonishing interest in\nthe little Jeanne--watching over her up-growing and giving her the\nbest of education at the convent, where she wins all hearts, and is\nknown as \"the little queen.\" The truth spoken with wondrous prophecy,\nif unthinkingly, as we shall see. Complacent Poisson came home, and\ntook the rich and fashionable, bland and smiling Lenormant de\nTournehem to his arms. Has he not wealth and estates? therefore as\nexcellent a friend for Poisson as for Madame Poisson. The girl Jeanne\nleaves the convent to be taught the accomplishments by the supreme\nmasters of France, the wits foregather at Madame Poisson's, and the\nbrilliant Jeanne is soon mistress of the arts--coquetry not least of\nall; has also the most exquisite taste in dress. Under all is a heart\ncold as steel; calculating as the higher mathematics. She has but one\nhindrance to ambition--her mean birth. Lenormant de Tournehem rids her\neven of this slur by making his nephew, Lenormant d'Etioles, marry\nher, giving the young couple half his fortune for dowry, and the\npromise of the rest when he dies--also he grants him a splendid\ntown-house, as splendid a country seat. And consequential\nself-respecting little Lenormant d'Etioles is lord of Etioles, amongst\nother seignories. So Jane Fish appears as Madame Lenormant d'Etioles,\nseductive, beautiful, accomplished, to whose house repair the new\nphilosophy, the wits, and artists. She has a certain sense of virtue;\nindeed openly vows that no one but the king shall ever come between\nher and her lord. But, deep in her heart, she has harboured a fierce\nambition--that the king shall help her to keep her bond. She puts\nforth all her gifts, all her powers, to win to the strange goal;\nconfides it to her worldly mother and \"uncle,\" Lenormant de Tournehem;\nfinds keen allies therein to the reaching of that strange goal. The\ndeath of the Ch\u00e2teauroux clears the way. At a masked ball the king is\nintrigued as to the personality of a beautiful woman who plagues him\nwith her art; he orders the unmasking. Madame Lenormant d'Etioles\nstands revealed, drops her handkerchief as by accident; the whisper\nruns through the Court that \"the handkerchief has been thrown!\" The\nking stoops and picks it up. A few evenings later she is smuggled into\nthe \"private apartments.\" She goes again a month later; in the morning\nis seized with sudden terror--she daren't go back to her angry lord\nlest he do her grievous harm; he will have missed her. The king is\ntouched; allows her to hide from henceforth in the secret apartments;\npromises the beautiful creature a lodging, her husband's banishment,\nand early acknowledgment as titular mistress--before the whole Court\nat Easter, says the pious Great One. But he has to join the army to\nplay the Conqueror at Fontenoy; and it is later in the year\n(September) before Madame d'Etioles is presented to the Court in a\nvast company and proceeds to the queen's apartments to kiss hands on\nappointment. Thus was Jeanne Poisson raised to the great aristocracy\nof France in her twenty-third year as Marquise de Pompadour.\n\nBoucher had been one of the brilliant group of artists of the\nd'Etioles' circle. That the Pompadour's influence had much effect upon\nhis position at Court for a year or two is unlikely; for she had to\nfight for possession of the king day and night, as the Ch\u00e2teauroux\nhad done, against the queen's party and the unscrupulous enmity of\nMaurepas. To set down Boucher's favour at Court to her is ridiculous.\n\nHe was painting for the queen's apartments at thirty-one when the\nPompadour was a school-girl of twelve. But in the year following her\nrise to power, Boucher painted four pictures for the large room of the\nDauphin, which were \"placed elsewhere\"; and, the year after that, he\nwas at work upon two pictures for the bedroom of the king at the\ncastle of Marly. It is likely enough that the Pompadour directed this\norder. She had almost immediately secured the office of the\nDirector-General of Buildings, which covered the direction of the\nroyal art treasures, for \"uncle\" Lenormant de Tournehem, who was also\na friend of the artist. And from this year it is significant that\nBoucher paints no more for the opposing camp of the Queen and Dauphin.\n\nHe was now giving all his strength to the \"Rape of Europa\" that he\npainted for the competition ordered by the Academy at the command of\nLenormant de Tournehem in the king's name, in which ten chosen\nAcademicians were to paint subjects in their own style for six prizes\nand a gold medal, to be awarded in secret vote by the competing\nartists themselves. Boucher won, by his amiable nature, the good-will\nof them all by proposing that they should so arrange as to share the\nprizes equally, and thus prevent any sense of soreness inevitable in\nthe losers.\n\nBut greatly as he won the good-fellowship of his fellow-artists by it,\nthis picture caused a murmur to rise amongst the critics who,\naforetime loud in his praise, now began to complain of his \"abuse of\nrose tints\" in the painting of the female nude. The fact was that\nDiderot and the men of the New Philosophy were turning their eyes to\nthe whole foundations upon which France was built, art as well as\nsociety, and were beginning to demand of art \"grandeur and morality in\nits subjects.\" They were soon to be clamouring for \"the statement of a\ngreat maxim, a lesson for the spectator.\" Diderot, with bull-like\ncourage, picked out the greatest, and turned upon Boucher, blaming him\nfor triviality.\n\nThe nations, weary of war, concluded the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in\nthe October of 1748. No sooner was peace concluded than Louis\nrelapsed into his old habit of dandified indolence and profligate\nease; and, putting from him his duties as the lord of a great people,\nhe gave himself up to shameless intrigues. He allowed the Pompadour to\nusurp his magnificence and to rule over the land. He yielded himself\nutterly, if sometimes sulkily, to her domination; and for sixteen\nyears she was the most powerful person at Court, the greatest force in\nthe state--making and unmaking ministers, disposing of office,\nhonours, titles, pensions. All political affairs were discussed and\narranged under her guidance; ministers, ambassadors, generals\ntransacted their business in her stately boudoirs; the whole patronage\nof the sovereign was dispensed by her pretty hands; the prizes of the\nChurch, of the army, of the magistracy could be obtained solely\nthrough her favour and good-will. Her energy must have been\nprodigious. Possessed of extraordinary talents and exquisite tastes,\nshe gave full rein to them, and it was in the indulgence of her better\nqualities that Destiny brought Boucher into the friendship of this\nwonderful woman. She became not only his patron but his pupil,\nengraving several of his designs.\n\nBut this, her sovereignty over the king, easy and light in its outward\nseeming, was a haggard nightmare to the calculating woman who had so\nlonged for it. She knew no single hour's rest from the night she won\nto the king's bed. She had to fight her enemies, secret and open, for\npossession of the king's will, day and night; and she fought--with\nrare courage. She won by consummate skill and unending pluck. She made\nherself an essential part of the king's freedom from care. The Court\nparty fought her for power with constant vigilance. Maurepas brought\nall his unscrupulous art, all his ironic mimicry, all his vile jibes\nand unchivalrous hatred to bear against her. He had made himself a\nnecessity to the king; and he never slept away a chance of injuring\nher. He knew no mercy, no nobility, no pity. He made her the detested\nobject of the people. With his own hands he penned the witty verses\nand epigrams that were sung and flung about the streets of Paris.\n\nBut she had an enemy more subtle than any at the Court--hour by hour\nshe had to dispute the king with the king's boredom. And it was in the\neffort to do so that she created her celebrated theatre in the\nprivate apartments, calling Boucher and others to her aid in the doing\nof it. Here the noblest of France vied with each other to obtain the\nsmallest part to play, an instrument in its orchestra, an invitation\nto its performances.\n\nBoucher left the Opera to become its decorator in 1748, and did not\nreturn until her death. For her, he also decorated her beautiful rooms\nat Bellevue. She bought at high prices many of his greatest\nmasterpieces.\n\nThe Pompadour's power so greatly increased that she openly took\ncommand of the king's will; dared and succeeded in getting his\nfavourite Maurepas banished; and herself took to the use of the kingly\n\"we.\" Her rascally father was created Lord of Marigny; her brother,\nwhom the king liked well and called \"little brother,\" was created\nMarquis de Vandi\u00e8res; her only child, Alexandrine, signed her name as\na princess of the blood royal, and would have been married to the\nblood royal had she not caught the small-pox and died. She amassed a\nprivate fortune, castles, and estates such as no mistress had dreamed\nof; and into them she poured art treasures that cost the nation\nthirty-six millions of money. She created the porcelain factory of\nS\u00e8vres, kept keen watch over the Gobelins looms, and founded the great\nMilitary School of St. Cyr amidst work that would have kept several\nstatesmen busy, and of deadly intrigues at Court that would have\nbroken the spirit of many a brilliant man.\n\nIt was in her hectic desire to keep the king from being bored that she\nstooped, and made Boucher stoop, to the employment of his high\nartistry in the painting of a series of indecent pictures wherewith to\ntickle the jaded desires of Boredom, and thereby gave rise to the\nwidespread impression that Boucher's art was ever infected by base\ndesign. But Boucher was, at his very worst, but a healthy animal; and\neven in these secret works for the king he did not reach so low as did\nmany an artist of more pious memory who painted with no excuse but his\nown pleasure.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the Pompadour has been blamed too much for this\nevil act, and too much forgotten for her splendid patronage of the man\nwho, under it and during these great years of his forties, produced a\nseries of masterpieces that place him in the foremost rank of the\npainters of his century. It is impossible to reckon the number of the\npastorals and Venus-pieces that his master-hand painted and loved to\npaint, during these the supreme years of his genius. It is significant\nthat they were painted during the years that saw the Pompadour in\nsupreme power.\n\nBoucher was so firmly established in 1750, his forty-seventh year,\nthat he moved into a new house in the Rue Richelieu, near the Palais\nRoyal. Disappointed in not receiving a studio and apartments at the\nLouvre, he was allowed to use a studio in the king's library. He was\nnow making money so easily that he was able to collect pictures and\nprecious stones and the gaily coloured curiosities that appealed to\nhis tastes.\n\nThe critics were becoming more and more censorious; and one of them\nhits true with the comment that in his pastorals his shepherdesses\nlook as if they had stepped over from the Opera and would soon be off\nagain thereto.\n\nIn his forty-eighth year Boucher's art was at its most luminous\nstage--his atmosphere clear and subtle and exquisitely rendered; his\nyellows golden; his whites satin-like and silvery; his flesh-tones\nupon the nude bodies of his goddesses unsurpassed by previous art. The\nbeauty of it all was not to last much longer.\n\nLenormant de Tournehem died suddenly in the November of 1751; the\nPompadour's brother, Abel Poisson de Vandi\u00e8res, was appointed\nDirector-General in his stead at the age of twenty-five--and soon\nafterwards, on the death of his father, created Marquis de Marigny--a\nshy, handsome youth, a gentleman and an honourable fellow, whom the\nking liked well, and against whom his sister's sole complaint was that\nhe lacked the brazen effrontery of the courtiers of the day. No man\ndid more for the advancement of the art of his time. A pension of a\nthousand livres falling vacant, the young fellow secured it for\nBoucher; and almost immediately afterwards, a studio becoming vacant\nat the Louvre owing to the death of Coypel, first painter to the king,\nBoucher came to his coveted home, eagerly moving in with his family as\nsoon as its wretched state could be put into repair.\n\nThe decoration of the new wing to the palace at Fontainebleau brought\nthe commission for the painting of the ceiling and the principal\npicture in the Council Chamber to Boucher, who had already decorated\nthe Dining-Room. This was the period of his painting the \"Rising\" and\nthe \"Setting of the Sun\" for the Pompadour, now in the Watteau\ncollection, two canvases that were always favourites with the painter,\nbitterly as they were assailed by the critic Grimm.\n\nHe was turning out so much work that it was impossible to give as much\ncare to his pictures as he ought. For he refused sternly, his life\nlong, to raise his prices; by consequence he had to create a larger\namount of work in order to meet his expenditure. It was about this\ntime that Reynolds, passing through Paris, went to visit him and found\nhim painting on a huge canvas without models or sketches. \"On\nexpressing my surprise,\" writes Reynolds, \"he replied that he had\nconsidered the model as necessary during his youth until he had\ncompleted his study of art, but that he had not used one for a long\ntime past.\"\n\nHe soon had not the time, not only to paint from nature but even to\ngive his pictures the work necessary to complete them. The feverish\nhaste which took possession of him in his frantic endeavour to meet\nthe vast demand for his pictures, and the eager efforts of his\nengravers to satisfy the public call for engravings after his works,\ngave him less and less leisure to joy in their doing. And his eyesight\nbegan to fail. His flesh-tints deepened to a reddish hue; and he\nstands baffled before his work, suspecting his sight, since what every\none cries out upon as being bright vermilion, he only sees as a dull\nearthy colour. Boucher has topped the height of his achievement; he\nhas to \"descend the other side of the hill.\" Boucher begins to grow\nold.\n\nIn Boucher's fifty-first year an ugly intrigue of the queen's party at\nCourt to sap the Pompadour's influence over the king by drawing away\nthe king's affections towards Madame de Choiseul-Romanet, a reckless\nyoung beauty of the Court, brought about a strange alliance. The Count\nde Stainville, one of the Pompadour's bitterest enemies, was shown the\nking's letter of invitation to his young kinswoman; and he, deeply\nwounded in his pride that his kinswoman should have been offered to\nthe king, went to the Pompadour and exposed the plot. A close\nalliance followed; and De Stainville thenceforth became her chief\nguide in affairs of state. It was at her instance that the king called\nhim to be his Prime Minister, raising him to the Duchy of Choiseul--a\nname he made illustrious as one of the greatest Ministers of France.\n\nIn his fifty-second year Boucher was appointed to the directorship of\nthe Gobelins looms, to the huge delight of the weavers and all\nconcerned with the tapestry factory. This was the year of his painting\nthe famous portrait of the Pompadour, to whom he several times paid\nthis \"tribute of immorality.\" For the Gobelins looms he produced many\nhandsome designs; and he was painting with astounding industry. But\nhis hand's skill began to falter. His art shows weariness in his\nsixtieth year, and sickness fell upon him, and held him in servitude\nnow with rare moments of respite. The critics, notoriously Diderot,\nwere now attacking him with shameless virulence. Boucher passed it all\nby; but he felt the change that was taking place in the public taste.\n\nThe ideas of the New Philosophy were infecting public opinion; the Man\nof Feeling had arisen in the land; and France, humiliated in war, and\nresenting the follies and the greed of her shameless privileged class,\nwas openly resenting it and all its works. Choiseul had planted his\nstrength deep in the people's party, and was come near to being its\ngod. His masterly mind had checked Frederick of Prussia to the North;\nand the nations, exhausted by the struggle, signed the Peace of Paris\nin 1763. Choiseul, with France at peace abroad, turned to the blotting\nout of the turbulent order of the Jesuits at home. Their attempt to\nend the Pompadour's relations with the king made this powerful woman\neager to complete his design; the chance was soon to come, and the\nOrder was abolished from France and its vast property seized by the\nstate.\n\nThe Pompadour lived but a short while to enjoy her triumph. Worn out\nby her superhuman activities, assailed by debt, she fell ill of a\nracking cough, dying on the 15th of April, 1764, in her forty-second\nyear, keeping her ascendancy over the king and the supreme power in\nFrance to her last hour. Death found her transacting affairs of state.\n\nLouis, weary of his servitude, had only a heartless epigram to cast\nat the body of the dead woman as she passed to her last resting-place.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE END\n\n\nThe death of the Pompadour robbed Boucher of a friend; but her\nbrother, Marigny, remained faithfully attached to the old artist, and\nseized every chance to honour him. On the death of Carle van Loo,\nBoucher, at sixty-two, was made first painter to the king, with all\nhis pensions and privileges that were consistent with this the supreme\nappointment in the art world.\n\nThere had been serious intention of making Boucher the head of the\nEcole des El\u00e8ves Proteg\u00e9s; he had the art of making himself liked and\nof inspiring the love of the arts. He was very popular with the\nstudents and artists, owing to his kindliness, his eagerness to render\nservice, his readiness to encourage the youngsters or to console them.\n\nWhen the riot took place, provoked by the Academicians by their award\nof the Prix de Rome in 1767, the students insulted the Academicians,\nbut hailed Boucher with enthusiastic applause. The reason was not far\nto seek. When a student came to the old master for advice he did not\n\"play the pontiff,\" and, scorning the false dignity of big phrases, he\ntook the brush in his hand and showed the way out of all difficulties\nby simplehearted example, despising rules, and putting himself out in\norder to make things clear to a young artist.\n\nHowever, the Academicians feared he would be an unorthodox master for\nyouth, and appointed another in his place.\n\nA long and serious illness thwarted his keen energies. Diderot was\ngiving himself up to outrageous violence against him. If the old\npainter exhibited at the Salon, Diderot fiercely assailed his art; if\nhe did not exhibit, Diderot as bitterly assailed him for his\nnegligences. Above all, he attacked Boucher in that he did not paint\nwhat Diderot would have painted--but could not. \"When he paints\ninfants,\" cries Diderot, \"you will not find one employed in a real act\nof life--studying his lesson, reading, writing, stripping hemp.\"\n\nPoor unfortunate infants! for whom Philosophy could find no happier\njoy in life than stripping hemp! Boucher was but an artist. He\npainted his generation as far as he could see it, and, with all his\nfaults and weaknesses, he never debauched his art with foreign and\nalien things that had no part in the nation's life; he painted fair\nFrance into his landscapes, not a make-believe land he did not know\nwith preposterous Greek ruins; and best of all, to his eternal honour,\nhe painted infants glad in their gladness to be alive, with no desire\nto send their happy little bodies to school, with no sickly ambition\nto make them into budding philosophers, with no thought of making them\npose and lie as Men of Feeling. He had no joy in setting their little\nbodies to toil--in making them \"teach a lesson to the spectator,\" in\nmaking them stoop their little shoulders to the \"picking of hemp.\"\n\nHe continued to paint as he had always painted--except that he painted\nless well. The wreath of roses was wilting on a grey head. The blood\njigged less warmly in the frail body. The features showed pallid--the\neyes haggard. The sight failed. The hand alone kept something of its\ncunning.\n\nHe went to Holland with his friend Randon du Boisset, but health\nshrank farther from him. Diderot had near spent his last jibe.\n\nIn 1768, Boucher's sixty-fifth year, the neglected queen went to her\ngrave. The king's grief and contrition and vows to amend his life came\ntoo late, and lasted little longer than the drying of the floods of\ntears over the body of his dead consort. A year later he was become\nthe creature of a pretty woman of the gutters, whom he caused to be\nmarried to the Count du Barry--the infamously famous Madame du Barry.\n\nBut neither the remonstrances of Choiseul with the king against this\nfurther degradation of the throne of France, nor his unconcealed scorn\nof the upstart countess, nor the dangerous enemy he made for himself\nthereby, signified now to Boucher, first painter to the king.\n\nBoucher was failing. His son was a prig and a disappointment. His two\nfavourite pupils, Baudoin and Deshayes, who had married his two girls,\ndied.\n\nTo the Salon of 1769 he sent his \"Caravan of Bohemians.\" It was his\nlast display. He had been going about for some time like a gaunt ghost\nof his former self, afflicted with all the ills inevitable to a life\nfeverishly consumed in work and the pursuit of pleasure.\n\nThey went to his studio at five of the clock one May morning, and\nfound him seated at his easel, before a canvas of Venus, dead, with\nthe paint-filled brush fallen out of his fingers.\n\nSo passed he away on the 30th of May 1770, in his sixty-seventh year.\n\nWhen Boucher died, the generation of which he was the limner was near\ncome to its violent end. The rosy carnivals and gay gallantries of his\nage gave way to the blood-stained romance and fierce tempest of the\nRevolution. The garrets of the old curiosity-shops received the\ndiscarded canvases of the master. His shepherds and shepherdesses were\nput to rout by the Romans of his pupil, citizen David. The old order\nwas brought into contempt and overthrown. And with it, Boucher's art,\nlike much that was gracious and charming and good in the evil thing,\nwent down also, and was overwhelmed for a while.\n\nFor a while only. For just as, out of the blood and terror of the\nRevolution, a real France arose, phnix-wise, from the ruin, and in\nbeing born, whilst putting off the vilenesses of the thing from which\nshe sprang, took on also to herself the gracious and winsome qualities\nthat place her amongst the most fascinating peoples of the ages; so\nBoucher has come into his kingdom again--the most gracious of painters\nthat the years have yielded."

                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n        a. One bed, or folding cot,\n        b. One oil stove,\n        c. One lamp,\n        d. Enough supplies of all kinds sufficient for six months,\n        e. Pots, pans, kettles, etc.\nIt is needless to say that positions in Manila and Iloilo were now at\na premium.\n\nWas it possible that teachers were to be sent to places where even the\nnecessaries of life could not be obtained! Was it possible that many\nwould be sent to places so remote that for six months no fresh\nsupplies could be gotten! A mass meeting was held at once, and a\ncommittee was appointed to send a cablegram to the Associated Press\npetitioning aid from the American people at large. Realizing what\nconsternation would be created throughout the United States by such a\nmessage, two of the teachers leaped into a carriage at the close of\nthe meeting and a few moments later were closeted with the chief\nexecutive of the department. As a result the committee was persuaded\nnot to send the cablegram to the Associated Press until by courtesy it\nhad been sent to the President. Of course, this diplomatic move tided\naffairs over and the teachers who had flatly refused to budge from\nManila now agreed to go on to their stations, being assured that\nwhatever action was best would be taken.\n\nThe day had come when we must separate. We were to enter an untried\nand an unknown field. It was fitting that we have a final joyous\nmeeting, so the best orchestra in the archipelago was engaged and we\n\"chased the hours with flying feet\" until dawn so that whatever might\ncome to us in that unknown future upon which we were entering each\nwould hold in pleasant memory our last evening together.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER III. - A DRAMA IN ACTUAL LIFE.\n\n\nAlmost every one heeded the warning to go to his station forearmed\nwith at least necessaries of life, but, as it had never fallen to the\nlot of the writer to cook, he refused to learn at that late day, so he\ntook no pot, no pan, no kettle, putting his future into the hands of\nan uncertain fate and relying upon the unknown hospitality of the\nFilipino.\n\nBacalod, the capital of the province of Occidental Negros, was our\ndestination. The second morning after leaving Manila, we awoke with\nthe \"Kilpatrick\" lying at anchor in a shallow bay. We were several\nmiles from the shore and nothing in sight indicated that we had\nreached a place of any importance. Late the night before we had been\nawakened by the loud, sharp ringing of the ship's bells, accompanied\nby the reversal of the engines and a general disturbance awaking the\ncrew. So our first impressions on coming on deck were that we had run\naground. But the captain assured us that everything was ship-shape and\nthat this was the nearest point of approach to Capiz, a town of\nconsiderable importance on the island of Panay, where a body of troops\nwas to embark for home. Not even the grass hut of a native was in\nsight. Search as we would, not a sign was seen of a stream flowing\ninto the sea, indicating the probable presence of a town. There was\nnot a sign of life of any kind save one lone column of thin, blue\nsmoke that arose from the side of a mountain miles away. One would\nhave thought that we were explorers of three hundred years ago lying\noff the shore of some unknown land.\n\nAfter breakfast the steam launch, together with all the boats, was\nlowered, and several of us who had determined to miss no opportunity\nto gather information about the islands took our places in the launch\nby the side of the ship's mate, and steamed away across the water with\na long line of boats strung out in the rear. We headed away toward a\ngroup of cocoanut trees, and about an hour later stepped ashore on a\npile of decayed coral rocks that extended some twenty or thirty feet\nout into the water, thus forming the only landing place of a town of\nseveral thousands of people and of considerable commercial importance.\n\nA few moments after we had landed, an army wagon drawn by a\nmagnificent pair of mules came up out of a tropical jungle along a\nnarrow road. We clambered into the wagon and were soon lost in the\ndepths of foliage from which we had just seen the vehicle emerge.\n\nLong waving bamboos with their plumy leafage hung over the road from\neach side, meeting and overlapping in the center until they formed an\narchway so dense that the tropical sun now high in the heavens\npenetrated it only at intervals. At times the wagon sank up to the\nhubs in the soft earth, and the muscles of the mules stood out like\nwhip-cords under the skin as they drew us forward.\n\nAt a sharp turn in the road we came upon the first division of troops\nthat was to embark for home. The look of joy upon their sun-browned\nfaces was inexpressible. Their work was done, and with elastic step\nand smiling faces they saluted us as they passed by. The reign of\nforce was at an end; it was going out with them; the reign of peace\nhad begun; it was coming in with us.\n\nIn the afternoon when we returned from the town the last of the troops\nhad arrived and, as we drove up, the bugle was sounding the call to\nsupper. We noticed native women mingling with the troops and, indeed,\na native woman was in constant attention waiting upon one of the\nsoldiers with whom we ate. Her clothes were clean, her hair was nicely\ncombed, and her general appearance was neat. She seemed to anticipate\nthe slightest wish of the soldier with whom she was. She brought him\nwater to drink, cleaned his plate after the meal and saw that his\nknife, fork, and spoon were put into his haversack.\n\nWe had now finished supper and the launch had returned for the last\nload of troops. The lieutenant in command of the company gave the\norder to \"fall in\"; the men shouldered their rifles and fell into\nline. \"Forward, march!\" called the lieutenant, and the column swept\nforward towards the boats. The women had until now restrained\nthemselves, but, as their husbands marched away never to return, their\nfeelings could no longer be restrained. One young woman of about\neighteen, who was leaning against a rock by the roadside sobbing, when\nher husband passed, leaped up in frenzy of passionate love and caught\nthe rifle from his shoulder. Her first impulse seemed to be to throw\nthe gun away, but suddenly realizing the futility of such an act she\nburst into tears, shouldered the rifle herself and marched on by his\nside. Another woman of more mature age threw her arms around the legs\nof a tall stalwart man, and drew him bodily from the line.\n\nBut the troops marched on and entered the boats. One woman who had\nbeen unnoticed before came down into the shallow water and caught hold\nof our last boat as if to prevent its leaving, while others stood\nmingling their sobs with the sounds of the wavelets as they broke on\nthe sands. As we passed away, an expectant mother, standing in bold\noutline against the twilight sky, threw up her hands in an agony of\ndespair and then sank upon the stones. The curtain had fallen upon a\ndrama in actual life deeper in pathos than any other we had ever seen\nor ever expected to see. Depth of passion, depth of love! Who can\nfathom the human heart?\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. - WHAT THE TEACHERS DID.\n\n\nThere is a remarkable sameness about the towns in the Philippines.\n\nThey all have a large open square about the middle of the town, around\nthree sides of which are Chinese stores, unless one side lies open to\nthe sea, and on the fourth is the great stone ecclesia. The streets\nrun at right angles to one another and divide up the town into\ncreditable squares.\n\nEverybody in the Philippines lives up-stairs, for the ground is so\nsoaked with water during the rainy season that it is a menace to\nhealth to live upon the ground floor. So even the poorest nippa hut\nis built upon stakes four or five feet above the ground.\n\nBacalod is a typical Philippine town. As we landed, a broad open\nsquare was spread out before us. Two sides of the square were lined\nwith two-story houses in which were Chinese stores below and Filipino\nhomes above. On the third side stood the great stone church in whose\nmassive tower the clock was striking the hour of four, while the\nfourth lay open to the sea that had borne us thither.\n\nWe landed, but it was in a method new to us and one not usually\nemployed by the traveling public.\n\nWhen our sail boat ran aground on the sandy bottom a hundred yards or\nmore from the shore, a crowd of Filipino men who were on the beach\nslowly rolled up their pantaloons and waded out to the rescue,--for\nthe money that was in it. The boat's crew elevated their trousers'\nlegs also and slided down into the water. Each of us then straddled\nthe neck of a Filipino standing in the water and was held by ankles to\nbe steadied while our biped mounts proceeded to the shore.\n\nWe were now on the ground and face to face with the situation. To give\nthe reader an idea of the actual conditions met by the first teachers\nwho went to the Islands, the following is copied from the instructions\ngiven us in Manila:\n    1. There shall be two sessions daily of all schools, and the\n    last hour of the morning session shall be devoted solely to\n    instructing the Filipino teachers.\n\n    2. In cases where teachers are sent to a town in which there\n    is no school-house, they are expected to secure the aid of the\n    people and have one built.\n\n    3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is\n    stopped.\n\n    4. All supplies must be kept under lock and key. In towns\n    where there is no case or box to lock the supplies in, and it\n    is also impossible to get the town council to furnish a case,\n    a requisition may be sent to Manila, and, if an appropriation\n    can be secured, one will be made and sent out.\n\nThus it can be easily seen that we were indeed pioneers. In many\nplaces no school-house was to be found, and in some cases it was even\ndifficult to get the town council to provide a case in which to keep\nthe supplies.\n\nThe work of the teachers was, in short; to \"make the English language\nthe basis of instruction in the public schools.\" On our arrival at\nBacalod two schools were found in progress, for some soldiers had been\ndetailed for the work here previous to our coming. One of these was\nfor boys and the other, for girls. Thus the work here had been in a\nmeasure simplified, but complications that had arisen at Talisay, one\nof the largest and richest towns on the island, demanded a change of\nteachers and the writer was assigned to the place as superintendent.\n\nHere an attempt had been made to start a school but it had failed\nignominiously and a system of education was to be put into operation\nfrom the very start.\n\nThe Filipinos are not strong advocates of co-education, so separate\nschools were to be started for the boys and the girls. The one for the\nboys was gotten well in hand before the one for the girls was\nattempted at all.\n\nA few days after reaching the town and securing a home the\npresidente of the town had it publicly announced that the following\nMonday morning at eight o'clock a public school for boys would be\nopened in a building that had been rented for the purpose by the\nmunicipal council. About the middle of the afternoon of the same day a\nman beat a little drum throughout all the streets of the town to call\nthe people out and the town clerk announced both in Spanish and in the\nnative language that this public school would begin at the time and\nplace mentioned above; that instruction would be free to all who came;\nthat the government would furnish all supplies; and that instruction\nwould be given in the English language. A native principal and\nassistants were employed and everything was ready to begin.\n\nThe official report of the result is as follows:\n    Boys' public school of Talisay, Negros, P. I., began November\n    4, 1901. Forty-three boys present at eight o'clock. Forty-one\n    of them knew \"good morning\" and \"good afternoon\" but do not\n    know the distinction between them. Two of them speak simple\n    Spanish. At eight forty-five, eight more, who had been\n    attending an early morning private school, came in together.\n\n    The books they brought were so varied and so different from\n    one another that it seemed impossible to bring any reasonable\n    degree of order out of such a chaos, and so, after struggling\n    vainly for about a week with the problem, the superintendent\n    by one fell stroke removed everything in use and put in a\n    uniform system, and from that day on the English language has\n    been the basis of instruction in the public schools of\n    Talisay. The work was of necessity very slow at first, but by\n    the end of a year two schools were going nicely and a number\n    of the brightest boys and girls had made really excellent\n    progress.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER V. - A \"BAILE.\"\n\n\nNot long after the arrival of our party at Bacalod we received an\ninvitation to a \"baile\" given in our honor by the inhabitants of\nSilay, a town some ten or twelve miles up the northern coast and one\nnoted for its social life. The invitation was accepted with pleasure,\nand about the middle of the afternoon on the day appointed we were\nclad in the immaculate white of the tropics and steaming away up the\ncoast on board a launch sent for our conveyance. Twilight was still\nlingering on the path of day when we anchored just off shore at the\ntown. A row-boat containing the officials of the city came out to meet\nus and, in due season, we were ushered into a spacious drawing-room\nfilled almost to overflowing with the \u00e9lite of the town. The \u00e9lite of\ntowns in the Philippines speak Spanish, and, as only one or two of our\nparty could at that time boast of more than a formal acquaintance with\nthe Castilian tongue, the exchange of ideas that evening between us\nand the Filipinos was of necessity not very rapid.\n\nThe necessity of easy communication between us was rendered somewhat\nless indispensable by the announcement of supper as soon as we were\nrested from our trip. When we had taken our places at the table a\nyoung Filipino about twenty-five years of age arose and gave a lengthy\ntoast to the recent union of the Philippines with the United States.\n\nBut as we Americans were unable to scale the dizzy heights of his\nclimaxes or sink to the depths of his pathos, we forewent the\npleasures of his oratory and turned our attention to the savory odor\nof lamb, chicken, and roast pig that came slyly stealing up our\nnostrils to send us nerve dispatches about the gastronomic delights of\nour not far distant future.\n\nAt last the toast was ended and the world-wide soup ushered in a long\ntrain of things good to eat, served in a style better fitted to the\ndelights of the appetite than to the formalities of dinners, for, as\nsoon as the pleasant task of one dish was completed by any one, the\nnext was served him at once regardless of the progress made by the\nothers at the table.\n\nThe last course was dulce. The new-comers to the Philippines will\nnot be long in making the acquaintance of this dish, and at all\nmeetings, both public and private, where eatables are served, it\nperforms an important part. It is anything sweet, and it may vary all\nthe way from an india-rubber-like black mixture of cocoanut milk and\ndirty sugar to a really toothsome and respectable confection. No\nmatter of what materials a dish is composed, just so long as it is\nsweet, it is dulce.\n\nAfter paying our respects to this last course, we arose from the table\nand entered a great rectangular room from the center of whose ceiling\nhung a large glass chandelier, a mass of shimmering crystals. In the\nchairs around the room were the wealth, the youth, and the beauty of\nthe town.\n\nThe first and also the last number of every Filipino dance of any\nformality is the \"rigodon.\" The dancers are arranged in a square, or\nquadrangle according to the number participating, and are then led\nthrough a tangled maze of figures that so utterly bewilders the novice\nthat he sinks into his chair at the end of the dance wondering how it\nall came to pass.\n\nWe Americans breathed a sigh of relief when the \"rigodon\" ended, and\nmustered fresh courage for social conquests in the waltz that was now\nbreathing forth from the trembling strings. My companion in the first\ndance had been the young lady by whose side I had sat at dinner. But\nit now became necessary to search for another, so I prudently waited\nto see how partners were chosen, and made no mistake when a few\nmoments later I faced one of the most luscious looking se\u00f1oritas on\nthe opposite side of the room and offered her my arm. My eyes must\nhave told the story that my lips could not utter in Spanish, for she\nsmiled upon me sweetly, arose, and put her hand upon my shoulder. My\narm encircled her waist and I began to waltz. Unfortunately my\ncompanion did not follow, but began to hop up and down in a manner\nmost distressing. Supposing the attack to be only temporary, I paused\nand, much to my relief, she soon showed signs of recovery; and in the\ncourse of time she came to a standstill looking up into my face in an\ninquiring sort of way, apparently wondering why St. Vitus had not paid\nhis respects to me also. A second attempt to follow the music met with\nresults similar to the first, and during the third attempt, which\nseemed to be trembling on the verge of a failure, St. Vitus let go my\ncompanion and seized me with such vigor that she, who was small even\nfor a Filipino, was gathered up bodily and taken around the room at\nsuch a pace that her toes touched the floor only at far distant\nintervals.\n\nAt this point my devotion to the shrine of Terpsichore ceased from\nforce of circumstances and I seated myself in one of the most\ncomfortable chairs in sight that I might carry out a previously formed\nplan to study the Filipino somewhat critically as he appears in\nsociety.\n\nThe first thing that impressed me as the dancers passed up and down\nthe room was the flash of diamonds. Nearly every woman in the room had\non a brooch that flashed the colors of the rainbow at every turn.\n\nAlmost all of them wore one or more rings that showed up brilliantly\nunder the chandelier. Many of the men too, especially the young men,\nwore gems that appeared to be exquisite. A closer inspection showed\nthat some of the gems had flaws and others were of a poor color, but\nno one would have denied that, taken as a whole, it was a really\nbeautiful display.\n\nThe dress of the ladies was richly colored. Many of their skirts were\nof silk covered with hand embroidered flowers, and their filmy pina\nwaists and broad collar pieces were rich with needle-work. They all\nwore a kind of heelless velvet slipper, very common as a dress shoe in\nthe Philippines, or high-heeled patent leather shoes with neatly\nfitting black stockings.\n\nThe men were dressed in white coats and white pantaloons or black\ncoats and white pantaloons. White shirts and collars, together with\nall sorts and styles of cravats and low-cut patent leather shoes with\nhighly colored socks completed their dress.\n\nIt was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money;\nthat they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a\ntable loaded with good things was a fact to which all of us were\nenthusiastic witnesses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VI. - A SKETCH OF LIFE IN THE PHILIPPINES.\n\n\nHouse-keeping in the Philippines presents some interesting phases. Our\nclub of American officials decided to run a mess, so we employed a\ncook and a house boy, then each of us provided himself with a personal\nservant, making a total of six servants for four men--it takes about\nthis proportion of servants to live in any sort of comfort in the\nPhilippines--and launched ourselves boldly upon the sea of domestic\neconomy. But there were shoals ahead of us, for the question of\nregulating servants is one of no small importance in the Philippines,\nand one of its most disadvantageous features is the long chain of\ndependents that usually attends it.\n\nWe gave the cooks so much a day with which to buy supplies in the\nlocal market, for our own table, making him render a daily list of\nexpenditures, and a fixed amount besides to purchase rice and fish for\nhimself and the other servants. Of course, if they wished to vary\ntheir diet and get chicken and fresh pork, which could be had at far\ndistant intervals, it was wholly a matter of their option, but the\nallowance was made on the basis of so much rice and fish a day for\neach. This allowance was about fifteen cents a day in Spanish coin per\nservant.\n\nThus far all was well. We had agreed to give the cook eight dollars a\nmonth in Spanish money, thinking that good wages would procure good\nservice, but the visions of affluence that floated before him on such\nfloods of wealth were so alluring that they drew him from the kitchen\nto the cooler veranda. In less than a week he had employed an\nassistant at four dollars a month; in less than another week that\nassistant had employed him an assistant at two dollars a month; in\nless than another week that assistant to the assistant had employed\nhim an assistant at the princely salary of fifty cents a month; and\nfrom fear that the chain of dependents would end only by our having\nthe whole Filipino race attached to our culinary force, we broke up\nhouse-keeping and went boarding again, choosing that as the less of\nthe two evils.\n\nOur house furnishings were almost wholly Philippine. The table ware\nand the food on the table came from the ends of the earth. The knives\nand forks were made in Germany, the plates were manufactured in\nEngland, the glass ware and table cloth, in the United States. The\noatmeal and flour came from the United States also. The butter came\nfrom Australia, the rice from China, the salt from Russia, and the\nother eatables from sources about as various as their separate names.\n\nSwitzerland furnished the condensed milk and Illinois the canned\ncream. Nearly all of the canned fruit bore labels from Spain.\n\nThus it can easily be seen that life in the Philippines, if lived\naccording to American ideals, is dependent upon a highly developed and\nhighly complex commerce. However, the difficulties of transportation\nand the restriction of large stocks of merchandise to Manila and some\nhalf a dozen other towns, make so great a difference between country\nlife and city life that a short comparison of the two will not be out\nof place, and life in Manila may well be taken as being fairly typical\nof the latter.\n\nLife in Manila is pleasant, but expensive. It is pleasant from the\nfact that it is not only the capital but also metropolis of the\narchipelago. Thus the combination of wealth and high official position\nhas given to Manila a society of the highest and most refined type.\n\nThe process of beautifying and improving the city which is constantly\ngoing on bids fair to give us at no distant day a city of which we may\nwell be proud.\n\nBut let him who intends living well in Manila on a small income bid\nfarewell at once to so idylic a dream, for it costs much to live well\nthere. In the city of Manila one can get almost anything he wishes,\nbut it must be paid for at the price it commands. Especially in the\ncase of eatables, this price is by no means small, because to the\nfirst cost of articles must in most cases be added the expense of\ndistant shipment from American, European, or Australian ports, and not\ninfrequently the cost of long refrigeration must also be taken into\nconsideration. But, expensive though it is, it is very pleasant to\nlive there and those who have once enjoyed it often wish again to\nquaff the cup of its delights.\n\nIn strong contrast to this pleasant life is the life of the quiet\nlittle hamlet away in the distant islands. Indeed, the Filipino from\nthe distant town, who by some good fortune has been to Manila, or, by\na coup de main, has studied in one of the Manila colleges, is looked\nup to in a true hero-worshiping attitude by all who either know him or\nhear of his fame. Life in such a place is one long state of harmless\ninactivity. Not a wave of trouble from the great outer world ever\ndisturbs its peaceful repose. One lounges forever in an air of\nindolent ease and extreme aversion to anything approaching what might\nbe called a respectable effort.\n\nOne arises in the morning about the time the sun's first rays silver\nthe top leaves of the cocoanut trees and then stirs around until nine\nor ten o'clock, when it is found expedient to avoid a further exposure\nto the sun. From then until about five o'clock in the afternoon it is\nbest to take things as they come, even though one of those things be a\nFilipino dinner. But then you may have your vehiclo attached to a\nyoung bull with a ring in his nose and go for a drive. If it is the\ndry season you will probably enjoy the drive unless you object to the\nfrequent clouds of dust swept along by the evening wind. If it is in\nthe rainy season your pleasure will depend to a considerable extent\nupon how wet you get; but, whether the season be wet or dry, your\npleasure will be regulated largely by the state of harmony existing\nbetween the driver and the bull.\n\nIn these quiet secluded nooks successive generations of Filipinos are\nborn, reared, grow old and die in an even chain of events broken only\nby the occasional erection of a new grass house on the identical spot\nwhere its predecessors have stood for ages. The son lives in the house\nof his father, cultivates the same few square feet of soil planted in\nedible roots, climbs the same cocoanut trees, follows the same winding\npath down to the stream, pounds rice in the same mortar and with the\nsame stick that his ancestors have used from time unremembered, and,\nin case of illness, curls up on a grass mat in a corner of the room\nuntil he dies or by some good fortune recovers. Beyond this narrow\nhorizon he never looks. So narrow and contracted is the life that the\nlanguages of two towns a few miles apart are so different that one\nwould scarcely recognize them as belonging to the same race of people.\n\nSuch are the two extremes of life in our new far Eastern provinces:\nthe one is active, progressive, and cosmopolitan; the other, inactive,\ndecadent, and narrow; but, whether one enjoys the first or endures the\nsecond, there comes to him after leaving a longing to lounge again in\ntropic airs and listen to the lullaby of the winds among the palms.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VII. - THE FILIPINO AT HOME.\n\n\nAs one enters a Filipino sitting-room for the first time, there is one\nfeature in the arrangement of the furniture that impresses itself upon\nhim at once, and it may be stated without fear of serious\ncontradiction that this same peculiar feature in its arrangement will\ncontinue to face him, as he enters different homes, about as certainly\nas he crosses the threshold.\n\nThe arrangement referred to is that of one large mirror, one settee,\nand some ten or a dozen chairs that appear to have had a certain\norderly affection for one another. The mirror is hung upon one of the\nlarge interior parts of the house about four feet above the floor. The\nwooden houses in the Philippines are built by setting large posts\nupright into the ground, extending into the air from twenty to thirty\nfeet. Cross timbers are fastened to these upright posts about eight or\nten feet above the ground and then not sawed off even with the posts,\nbut allowed to extend beyond them each way. The framework of the house\nis built upon these extending cross timbers, a style of building by\nwhich these large upright posts are left standing out on the inside of\nthe room from one to three feet from the walls. It is on that one of\nthese posts most nearly opposite the door that the mirror always finds\nits place. Immediately beneath the mirror is the settee; and the\nchairs are arranged in two parallel lines facing one another and at\nright angles with the ends of the settee. However odd this arrangement\nmay appear to one when he first enters a Filipino drawing-room, there\nare two things to be said in its favor. In the first place, it places\nyou face to face with the person with whom you are conversing so that\nyou can watch him,--a matter of no small moment in the Philippines. In\nthe next place, it enables you to give one of the young ladies a\nsheep's-eye in the mirror while the others present are left where\nMoses was in our much abused conundrum.\n\nThe size of the residence and the quality of its furnishings depends\nupon the wealth of the owner. But there is so vast a difference\nbetween the mode of life of the highest class and the tao, or lowest\nclass, that it is well to speak of them separately, and the great\nmiddle class of Filipinos can easily be imagined to occupy the\nintervening ground.\n\nThe rich Filipino's house is usually of wood built upon a wall of\nstone or brick from ten to fifteen feet high. The floors are kept\nhighly polished in his hallway, dressing-room, and bed-rooms. There\nare, of course, no fire-places in any of the rooms, but on some\noccasions something is needed to dry the rain-soaked atmosphere, for\neven in the dry season it has been seen to rain for five successive\ndays and nights without the cessation of a moment.\n\nA long chain of dependents is attached to the household of the rich\nFilipino. The master has his special body servant to be present at all\ntimes to do his master's bidding, in short, to be the visible\nmechanism of his master's volition. So, too, the lady of the house has\nher servant woman to do the slightest bidding of her ladyship. Then\nthere is the cook who is almost invariably a man, a house boy or two,\nand the coachman. These functionaries, with their assistants and\nassistants to the assistants, together with a servant or two for the\nexclusive service of the children, complete the economic household.\n\nSuch a family has an abundance of rice and wheat bread, also of\nchicken and fish with occasional fresh beef. They have also a good\ndeal of dulce. They regularly serve wine and frequently serve beer\non their tables.\n\nIn strong contrast with this mode of life is that of the tao. His\ndiet consists almost wholly of rice and small uncleaned fish boiled\ntogether. As a rule knife, fork, plate, and spoon find no place in his\nhousehold. The rice and fish are boiled in a pot and then allowed to\ncool in the same vessel or poured out to cool in a large earthen or\nwooden bowl. Then Mr. Tao together with Mrs. Tao and all the young\nTaos squat on their heels around the mixture and satisfy that\nintangible thing called the appetite. They do not use chop sticks as\nthe Chinese do, but the rice and fish are caught in a hollow formed by\nthe first three fingers of the right hand. The thumb is then placed\nbehind the mass. It is raised up and poised before the mouth, with a\nskill coming from the evolution of ages, when a contraction of the\nmuscles of the thumb throws the mass into the mouth with a skill that\nis marvelous to any but a Filipino. To judge from the most reliable\ninformation, the poorest class do not have an abundance of food,\nalthough it would seem that such a condition of things would be\nwell-nigh impossible. However, in a census of one hundred school\nchildren there were found six boys and four girls who declared that\nthey had never had enough to eat, and the native teacher stated that\nthis was probably true.\n\nThe wide gulf between the tao and the rich man is filled by the\ngreat middle class of Filipinos.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VIII. - VISIT TO A LEPER COLONY.\n\n\nNot far from our town was a leper colony and the first Saturday that\ncould be spared was set aside for a trip to the place. It happened\nthat none of the other Americans were at leisure on this particular\nmorning, but, rather then delay the trip or miss it altogether, the\nwriter, armed with a revolver, started out alone.\n\nThe road had been described so accurately by one who was supposed to\nknow it that it was deemed well-nigh impossible to miss the way. The\nmain highway was followed to the point where the by-path supposed to\nlead to the settlement turned off through some bamboo thickets and a\nlow tropical wood. This path led straight away towards the sea-coast\nwhere the houses of the colony were said to stand in a cocoanut grove\nby the beach.\n\nUpon arriving at the settlement, a very inhospitable reception was\nreceived from a mangy cur that growled and showed a very uninviting\nset of sharp, white teeth behind his snarling lips. The growling of\nthe dog had attracted the attention of an old man who, with age-bent\nback, was pounding rice in a mortar about fifty yards away. He turned\nslowly around and, upon seeing an intruder into the primitive quiet of\nthe place, gave a sharp, far-reaching call. The sound had scarcely\nrung through the grove when from about a dozen of the little grass\nhouses dotted here and there fifteen or twenty men armed with bolos\ncame out and gathered around the old man. A sense of my danger flashed\nupon me. Three miles from town and alone in a tropical jungle, I could\nbe almost instantly overcome by this band of bolo-men, and the only\nreport that would ever reach my people would be that I had\n\"disappeared.\" Of course, attack was by no means certain, but the\npotentiality of the situation was thrilling. A drawn revolver and the\ngleaming of its shining barrel had the effect of stopping the men, who\nseemed to be hesitating as to a course of action, until a somewhat\ndignified retreat was made to an open space in the rear from where a\nless dignified and a more hasty retreat began which did not stop short\nof Bacalod.\n\nEnough had been seen, however, even in this short visit, to give\nconvincing proof that the settlement visited was no colony of lepers;\nso, that afternoon two servant boys being taken as guides and\ninterpreters, another attempt was made to reach the goal desired.\n\nThis attempt was successful, and, after about two hours of walking, a\nlittle cluster of grass huts snugly hidden by the sea-coast came into\nview. As we approached, one would have thought it a gala-day. Some few\nchildren, apparently from six to thirteen years of age, almost wholly\nnude, were romping and playing in the open space around which the huts\nstood, and no one would ever have thought that any cloud so horrible\nas leprosy could hover over a place apparently so happy.\n\nBy the side of the path as we passed was a man and his wife setting\nout potato plants. His hands were so puffed and his fingers so short\nthat he could scarcely use them, but he was working along as best he\ncould. His wife's feet were so swollen and twisted that she walked\nonly with the greatest difficulty. We passed them by and entered the\nopen space above referred to.\n\nThe children now saw us, and those of them who could darted away like\nfrightened rabbits, each to his own burrow. An old man who was sitting\nin the warm afternoon sun on the little bamboo platform before his hut\nwas aroused from his lethargic repose by the scampering away of the\nchildren. He arose, trembling upon his tottering limbs, all drawn and\ntwisted, and hobbled away into his hut.\n\nThe children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at\nthe doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of\nthe settlement. In a few moments we were surrounded by a circle of\nhuman beings at once so repulsive and so pitiable that its graphic\nvividness can never be accurately portrayed.\n\nThe old man referred to above, having put on a pair of snow-white\npantaloons, appeared now at the doorway of his hut, followed a few\nmoments later by his wife who had evidently clothed herself in the\nbest raiment she had. At a call from the old man, all the men, women,\nand children in the settlement came out of their huts and stood in a\nline before us. The old man was spokesman and in his native visayan\ntongue made a heart-rending appeal for aid which we were powerless to\ngive. Attention was called to a leper woman, apparently about\ntwenty-five years of age, whose face had been attacked by the disease\nand whose appearance was truly pathetic. Upon her hip was a child\nabout a year and a half old and, strange to say, the child showed as\nyet no signs whatever of the disease.\n\nWhat an indissoluble enigma is life! Here in a little cluster of grass\nhuts in a secluded nook of a secluded island of an all but secluded\narchipelago was gathered together a little community of wretched\nnatives, driven by their loathsomeness from association with others\neven of the same half-savage race. Yet here, men and women loved and\nwere married, by mutual trust if not by law, and children were born of\nthe union to live forever under the unspeakable horror that\novershadowed the unfortunate parents. Love, hatred, sorrow, and\njoy--every passion that enters into the complex structure of the human\nheart even here, in this scene of sadness and despair, was playing\napparently as freely as where misfortune and disease had never crossed\nthe portals of life.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER IX. - A \"HIKE.\"\n\n\nWe were lounging lazily in our hammocks at Jimamaylan one evening in\nApril. Supper was just ended, and the soldiers in the post were\ncollected in groups here and there spinning yarns to pass away the\ntime, when a Filipino clad only in a loin cloth came down the street\nat a steadily swinging run and stopped in front of the sentry. He\nbrought the announcement that a band of ladrones had just burned a\nsugar mill and were advancing to sack a barrio about fifteen miles\naway.\n\nThe invitation of the commanding officer to go on a \"hike\" was eagerly\naccepted, and, in ten minutes after the message was given, the troops\nwere on the march followed by two adventurous pedagogues.\n\nDarkness was just closing in as we left the town, but a resplendent\ntropic moon soon made the night almost as brilliant as the day. The\ntrail we followed led over rough and rocky country. Sometimes for a\ndistance of a mile or more we passed over barren wastes of volcanic\nslag poured out in anger by some peak whose convulsions have long\nsince ceased. Again we would descend into a tropical jungle from the\ndense foliage of which the ladrones could have leaped at any moment,\nhad they known of our coming, and annihilated our little band. We\nforded rapid streams with the water at our breasts, and halted only\nonce in that rapid march of fifteen miles.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the town we met a man who was standing\nguard against a surprise by the ladrones. Nothing could well have been\nmuch more grotesque and nothing could much better illustrate the\nabsolutely primitive condition of the Filipinos in the interior of the\nislands than the appearance of this guard. A pair of knee pants, a\nconical grass hat, and a hemp shirt formed his entire apparel. A long\nflat wooden shield, a bolo, and a long bamboo spear with a sharp,\nflat, iron point, completed his equipment for battle.\n\nHere stood the first and the twentieth centuries side by side. The\nFilipino who had advanced only a stage beyond the condition of\nprimitive man with his knife, spear, and wooden shield, stood side by\nside with the American soldier, a representative of modern life with\nhis magazine rifle, his canteen, his knapsack,--with every article of\nhis clothing made to give him the highest possible efficiency as the\nunit of a military organization.\n\nA few yards farther on we met another guard equipped similarly to the\nfirst. Upon reaching the town, news had just been received that a\ndetachment of troops from another post had intercepted the ladrones\nand fought a skirmish with them. The ladrones had escaped and we set\nout in pursuit of them on a chase wilder than a Quixotic dream. We\nwound our way into the mountains behind the town, inquiring at every\ngrass hut we passed whether the band of ladrones had passed that way,\nbut only once was even a trace of them found. Then it was learned that\nat a certain place they had separated into groups of three or four and\ngone glimmering through the dream of things that were. This place was\nin a secluded nook of the mountains where in years gone by some\nadventurous Spaniard had erected a primitive water mill to grind his\nsugar-cane. We had now marched about twenty miles and the feet of the\npedagogues were a mass of blisters. They had reached the point where\nthat form of military maneuvering called \"hiking\" ceased to possess\nany alluring charms. So a native was persuaded to come out of his lone\nmountain hut and hitch up his carabao and cart. He was then made to\nget on the carabao's back, while the aforesaid pedagogues lay down on\nthe sugar-cane pulp that had been put into the body of the cart, and\nthe driver was instructed to start for the post we had left hours\nbefore, and not to stop until he got there. Being uncertain but that\nsome of the ladrones would learn of our having left the body of troops\nand would try the metal of our steel, we at first agreed that neither\nof us should go to sleep, but it was later decided that probably the\ndriver had no greater desire to cross the Styx than his passengers had\nand that in case of danger he would awaken us, so both took a revolver\nin each hand, stretched out supinely and went to sleep.\n\nSuch a sleep! The rough jolting of the cart over an almost impassable\nroad was never enough to break the spell of slumber. When we awoke the\nblazing tropic sun was past the midday mark of morning, shining full\ninto our unprotected and well-nigh blistered faces.\n\nA pack of dogs were heralding our approach to a little village at the\nfoot of the mountains where ponies were procured to take us back to\nthe post.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he insists, \"have stood the test of ages; and the plant\nevery where retained its name and credit: and one of our good\nherbarists, who had seen a wonderful case of a swoln spleen, so big, and\nhard as to be felt with terror, brought back to a state of nature by it\"\n\n(p. 37). The greatest portion of Hill's concluding section combines\nadvertisement for the powder medicine he was himself manufacturing at a\nhandsome profit together with a protest against competing apothecaries:\n\"An intelligent person was directed to go to the medicinal herb shops in\nthe several markets, and buy some of this Spleen-wort; the name was\nwritten, and shewn to every one; every shop received his money, and\nalmost every one sold a different plant, under the name of this: but\nwhat is very striking, not one of them the right\" (p. 42).\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis did not cease to be printed after Hill's in\n1766, but continued to issue from the presses into the nineteenth\ncentury. A good example of this is the tome by John Reid, physician to\nthe Finsbury Dispensary in London, Essays on Insanity, Hypochondriasis\nand Other Nervous Affections (1816), which summarizes theories of the\nmalady. A bibliographical study of such works would probably reveal\na larger number of titles in the nineteenth century than in the previous\none, but by this time the nature and definition of hypochondria had\nchanged significantly.\n\nIf John Hill's volume is not an important contribution in the history of\nmedicine, it is a lucid and brief exposition of many of the best ideas\nthat had been thought and written on the hyp, with the exception of his\nuninhibited prescribing of herbal medicines as cure-alls. An\nunderstanding of this disease is essential for readers of neoclassical\nEnglish literature, especially when we reflect upon the fact that some\nof the best literature of the period was composed by writers whom it\nafflicted. It is perhaps not without significance that the greatest poet\nof the Augustan age, Alexander Pope, thought it necessary as he lay on\nhis deathbed in May 1744 to exclaim with his last breath, \"I never was\nhippish in my whole life.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. I. - The NATURE of the DISORDER.\n\n\nTo call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and cruel. It\nis a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by thickened\nand distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver, and other\nparts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick scarce knows\none more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\n\nThe blood is a mixture of many fluids, which, in a state of health, are\nso combined, that the whole passes freely through its appointed vessels;\nbut if by the loss of the thinner parts, the rest becomes too gross to\nbe thus carried through, it will stop where the circulation has least\npower; and having thus stopped it will accumulate; heaping by degrees\nobstruction on obstruction.\n\nHealth and chearfulness, and the quiet exercise of mind, depend upon a\nperfect circulation: is it a wonder then, when this becomes impeded the\nbody looses of its health, and the temper of its sprightliness? to be\notherwise would be the miracle; and he inhumanly insults the afflicted,\nwho calls all this a voluntary frowardness. Its slightest state brings\nwith it sickness, anguish and oppression; and innumerable ills follow\nits advancing steps, unless prevented by timely care; till life itself\ngrows burthensome.\n\nThe disease was common in antient Greece; and her physicians understood\nit, better than those perhaps of later times, in any other country; who\nthough happy in many advantages these fathers of the science could not\nhave, yet want the great assistance of frequent watching it in all its\nstages.\n\nThose venerable writers have delivered its nature, and its cure: in the\nfirst every thing now shews they were right; and what they have said as\nto the latter will be found equally true and certain. This, so far as\npresent experience has confirmed it, and no farther, will be here laid\nbefore the afflicted in a few plain words.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. II. - Persons Subject to it.\n\n\nFatigue of mind, and great exertion of its powers often give birth to\nthis disease; and always tend to encrease it. The finer spirits are\nwasted by the labour of the brain: the Philosopher rises from his study\nmore exhausted than the Peasant leaves his drudgery; without the benefit\nthat he has from exercise. Greatness of mind, and steady virtue;\ndetermined resolution, and manly firmness, when put in action, and\nintent upon their object, all also lead to it: perhaps whatever tends to\nthe ennobling of the soul has equal share in bringing on this weakness\nof the body.\n\nFrom this we may learn easily who are the men most subject to it; the\ngrave and studious, those of a sedate temper and enlarged understanding,\nthe learned and wise, the virtuous and the valiant: those whom it were\nthe interest of the world to wish were free from this and every other\nillness; and who perhaps, except for this alloy, would have too large a\nportion of human happiness.\n\nThough these are most, it is not these alone, who are subject to it.\n\nThere are countries where it is endemial, and in other places some have\nthe seeds of it in their constitution; and in some it takes rise from\naccidents. In these last it is the easiest of cure; and in the first\nmost difficult.\n\nBeside the Greeks already named, the Jews of old time were heavily\nafflicted with this disease; and in their descendants to this day it is\noften constitutional: the Spaniards have it almost to a man; and so have\nthe American Indians. Perhaps the character of these several nations may\nbe connected with it. The steady honour, and firm valour of the\nSpaniard, very like that of the ancient Doric nation, who followed the\nflute not the trumpet to the field; and met the enemy, not with shouts\nand fury, but with a determined virtue: it is the temper of the\nHypochondriac to be slow, but unmoveably resolved: the Jew has shewn\nthis mistakenly, but almost miraculously; and the poor Indian, untaught\nas he is, faces all peril with composure, and sings his death-song with\nan unalter'd countenance.\n\nAmong particular persons the most inquiring and contemplative are those\nwho suffer oftenest by this disease; and of all degrees of men I think\nthe clergy. I do not mean the hunting, shooting, drinking clergy, who\nbear the tables of the great; but the retir'd and conscientious; such as\nattend in midnight silence to their duty; and seek in their own cool\nbreasts, or wheresoever else they may be found, new admonitions for an\nage plunged in new vices. To this disease we owe the irreparable loss of\nDr. YOUNG; and the present danger of many other the best and most\nimproved amongst us. May what is here to be proposed assist in their\npreservation!\n\nThe Geometrician or the learned Philosopher of whatever denomination,\nwhose course of study fixes his eye for ever on one object, his mind\nintensely and continually employed upon one thought, should be warned\nalso that he is in danger; or if he find himself already afflicted, he\nshould be told that the same course of life, which brought it on, will,\nwithout due care, encrease it to the most dreaded violence.\n\nThe middle period of life is that in which there is the greatest danger\nof an attack from this disease; and the latter end of autumn, when the\nsummer heats have a little time been over, is the season when in our\nclimate its first assaults are most to be expected. The same time of the\nyear always increases the disorder in those who have been before\nafflicted with it; and it is a truth must be confessed, that from its\nfirst attack the patient grows continually, though slowly, worse; unless\na careful regimen prevent it.\n\nThe constitutions most liable to this obstruction are the lean, and dark\ncomplexioned; the grave and sedentary. Let such watch the first\nsymptoms; and obviate, (as they may with ease) that which it will be\nmuch more difficult to remove.\n\nIt is happy a disease, wherein the patient must do a great deal for\nhimself, falls, for the most part, upon those who have the powers of\nreason strongest. Let them only be aware of this, that the distemper\nnaturally disposes them to inactivity; and reason will have no use\nunless accompanied with resolution to enforce it.\n\nThough the physician can do something toward the cure, much more depends\nupon the patient; and here his constancy of mind will be employed most\nhappily. No one is better qualified to judge on a fair hearing what\ncourse is the most fit; and having made that choice, he must with\npatience wait its good effects. Diseases that come on slowly must have\ntime for curing; an attention to the first appearances of the disorder\nwill be always happiest; because when least established it is easiest\noverthrown: but when that happy period has been neglected, he must wait\nthe effects of such a course as will dilute and melt the obstructing\nmatter gradually; for till that be done it is not only vain, but\nsometimes dangerous, to attempt its expulsion from the body.\n\nThe blood easily separates itself into the grosser and the thinner\nparts: we see this in bleeding; and from the toughness of the red cake\nmay guess how very difficult it will be to dissolve a substance of like\nfirmness in the vessels of the body. That it can thus become thickened\nwithin the body, a Pleurisy shews us too evidently: in that case it is\nbrought on suddenly, and with inflammation; in this other, slowly and\nwithout; and here, even before it forms the obstruction, can bring on\nmany mischiefs. Various causes can produce the same effect, but that in\nall cases operates most durably, which operates most slowly. The watery\npart of the blood is its mild part; in the remaining gross matter of it,\nare acrid salts and burning oils, and these, when destitute of that\nhappy dilution nature gives them in a healthy body, are capable of doing\ngreat mischief to the tender vessels in which they are kept stagnant.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. III. - The SYMPTOMS of the DISORDER.\n\n\nThe first and lightest of the signs that shew this illness are a lowness\nof spirits, and inaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love\nof solitude and a habit of thinking, even on trifling subjects, with too\nmuch steadiness. A very little help may combat these: but if that\nindolence which is indeed a part of the disorder, will neglect them;\nworse must be expected soon to follow.\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness, weight, and oppression in the body,\na want of appetite, or, what is worse, an appetite without digestion;\nfor these are the conditions of different states of the disease, a\nfullness and a difficulty of breathing after meals, a straitness of the\nbreast, pains and flatulencies in the bowels, and an unaptness to\ndischarge their contents.\n\nThe pulse becomes low, weak, and unequal; and there are frequent\npalpitations of the heart, a little dark-coloured urine is voided at\nsome times; and a flood of colourless and insipid at others; relieving\nfor a moment, but increasing the distemper: there is in some cases also\na continual teazing cough, with a choaking stoppage in the throat at\ntimes; then heartburn, sickness, hardness of the belly, and a costive\nhabit, or a tormenting and vain irritation.\n\nThe lips turn pale, the eyes loose their brightness and by degrees the\nwhite grows as it were greenish, the gums want their due firmness, with\ntheir proper colour; and an unpleasing foulness grows upon the teeth:\nthe inside of the mouth is pale and furred, and the throat dry and\nhusky: the colour of the skin is pale (though there are periods when the\nface is florid) and as the obstruction gathers ground, and more affects\nthe liver, the whole body becomes yellow, tawny, greenish, and at length\nof that deep and dusky hue, to which men of swift imagination have given\nthe name of blackness.\n\nThese symptoms do not all appear in any one period of the disease, or in\none case, but at one time or other all of them, as well as those which\nfollow: the flesh becomes cold to the touch, though the patient does not\nhimself perceive it; the limbs grow numbed and torpid, the breathing\ndull and slow, and the voice hollow; and usually the appetite in this\nperiod declines, and comes almost to nothing: night sweats come on,\nblack swellings appear on the veins, the flesh wastes and the breast\nbecomes flat and hollow: the mouth is full of a thin spittle, the head\nis dizzy and confus'd, and sometimes there is an unconquerable numbness\nin the organs of speech.\n\nI have known the temporary silence that follows upon this last symptom\nbecome a jest to the common herd; and the unhappy patient, instead of\ncompassion and assistance, receive the reproof of sullenness, from those\nwho should have known and acted better.\n\nAbout twenty years ago I met on a visit at Catthorpe in Leicestershire a\nyoung gentleman of distinguished learning and abilities, who at certain\ntimes was speechless. The vulgar thought it a pretence: and a jocose\nlady, where he was at tea with company, putting him as she said to a\ntrial, poured out a dish very strong and without sugar. He drank it and\nreturned the cup with a bow of great reserve, and his eye bent on the\nground: she then filled the cup with sugar, and pouring weak tea on it,\nsent it him: he drank that too, looked at her steadily, and blushed for\nher. The lady declared the man was dumb; the rest thought him perverse,\nand obstinate; but a constant and steady perseverance in an easy method\ncured him.\n\nAll these are miseries which the disease, while it retains its natural\nform, can bring upon the patient; and thus he will in time be worn out,\nand led miserably, though slowly, to the grave. Let him not indulge his\ninactivity so far as to give way to this, because it is represented as\nfar off; the disease may suddenly and frightfully change its nature; and\nswifter evils follow.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. IV. - The DANGER.\n\n\nWe have done with the obstruction considered in itself; but this, though\noften unsurmountable by art, at least by the methods now in use, will be\nsometimes broken through at once by nature, or by accidents; and bring\non fatal evils. These are strictly different diseases, and are no\notherway concerned here, than as the consequences of that of which we\nare treating.\n\nThe thick and glutinous blood which has so long stagnated in the spleen,\nwill have in that time altered its nature, and acquired a very great\ndegree of acrimony: while it lies dormant, this does no more mischiefs,\nthan those named already; but when violent exercise, a fit of outrageous\nanger, or any thing else that suddenly shocks and disturbs the frame,\nputs it in motion, it melts at once into a kind of liquid putrefaction.\n\nBeing now thin, it mixes itself readily with the blood again, and brings\non putrid fevers; destroys the substance of the spleen itself, or being\nthrown upon some other of the viscera, corrodes them, and leads on this\nway a swift and miserable death. If it fall upon the liver, its tender\npulpy substance is soon destroyed, jaundices beyond the help of art\nfirst follow, then dropsies and all their train of misery; if on lungs,\nconsumptions; if on the brain, convulsions, epilepsy, palsy, apoplexy;\nif on the surface, leprosy.\n\nThe intention of cure is to melt this coagulation softly, not to break\nit violently; and then to give it a very gentle passage through the\nbowels. There is no safe way for it to take but that; and even that when\nurged too far may bring on fatal dysenteries.\n\nLet none wonder at the sudden devastation which sometimes arises from\nthis long stagnant matter, when liquified too hastily: how long, how\nmany years the impacted matter will continue quiet in a schirrous tumour\nof the breast; but being once put in motion, whether from accident, or\nin the course of nature, what can describe; or what can stop its\nhavock!\n\nInstances of the other are too frequent. A nobleman the other day died\nparalytick: dissection shewed a spleen consumed by an abscess, formed\nfrom the dissolved matter of such an obstruction: and 'tis scarce longer\nsince, a learned gentleman, who had been several years lost to his\nfriends, by the extreams of a Hypochondriacal disorder, seem'd gradually\nwithout assistance to recover: but the lungs suffered while the spleen\nwas freed; and he died very soon of what is called a galloping\nconsumption.\n\nWhen the obstruction is great and of long continuance, if it be thus\nhastily moved, the consequence is, equally, a sudden and a miserable\ndeath, whether, like the matter of a cancer, it remains in its place; or\nlike that of a bad small pox, be thrown upon some other vital part.\n\nLet not the patient be too much alarmed; this is laid down to caution,\nnot to terrify him: it is fit he should know his danger, and attend to\nit; for the prevention is easy; and the cure, even of the most advanced\nstages, when undertaken by gentle means, is not at all impracticable: to\nassist the physician, let him look into himself, and recollect the\nsource of his complaint. This he may judge of from the following\nnotices.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. V. - The Causes of the HYPOCHONDRIASIS.\n\n\nThe obstruction which forms this disease, may take its origin from\ndifferent accidents: a fever ill cured has often caused it; or the\npiles, which had been used to discharge largely, ceasing; a marshy soil,\npoisoned with stagnant water, has given it to some persons; and altho'\nindolence and inactivity are oftenest at the root, yet it has arisen\nfrom too great exercise.\n\nReal grief has often brought it on; and even love, for sometimes that is\nreal. Study and fixed attention of the mind have been accused before;\nand add to these the stooping posture of the body, which most men use,\nthough none should use it, in writing and in reading. This has\ncontributed too much to it; but of all other things night studies are\nthe most destructive. The steady stillness, and dusky habit of all\nnature in those hours, enforce, encourage, and support that settled\ngloom, which rises from fixt thought; and sinks the body to the grave;\neven while it carries up the mind to heaven. He who would have his lamp\n        At midnight hour\n  Be seen in some high lonely tower,\nwill waste the flame of this unheeded life: and while he labours to\nunsphere the spirit of Plato will let loose his own.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VI. - The Cure of the HYPOCHONDRIASIS.\n\n\nLet him who would escape the mischiefs of an obstructed spleen, avoid\nthe things here named: and let him who suffers from the malady,\nendeavour to remember to which of them it has been owing; for half the\nhope depends upon that knowledge.\n\nNature has sometimes made a cure herself, and we should watch her ways;\nfor art never is so right as when it imitates her: sometimes the\npatient's own resolution has set him free. This is always in his power,\nand at all times will do wonders.\n\nThe bleeding of the piles, from nature's single efforts, has at once\ncured a miserable man; where their cessation was the cause of the\ndisorder. A leprosy has appeared upon the skin, and all the symptoms of\nthe former sickness vanished. This among the Jews happened often: both\ndiseases we know were common among them: and I have here seen something\nvery like it: Water-Dock has thrown out scorbutic eruptions, and all the\nformer symptoms of an Hypochondriacal disorder have disappeared:\nreturning indeed when these were unadvisedly struck in; but keeping off\nentirely when they were better treated. A natural purging unsuppressed\nhas sometimes done the same good office: but this is hazardous.\n\nIt is easy to be directed from such instances; only let us take the\nwhole along with us. Bleeding would have answered nature's purpose, if\nshe could not have opened of herself the h\u00e6morrhoidal vessels; but he\nwho should give medicines for that purpose, might destroy his patient by\ntoo great disturbance. If a natural looseness may perform the cure, so\nmay an artificial; when the original source of the disorder points that\nway. But these are helps that take place only in particular cases.\n\nThe general and universal method of cure must be by some mild and gently\nresolving medicine, under the influence of which the obstructing matter\nmay be voided that, or some other way with safety. The best season to\nundertake this is the autumn, but even here there must be caution.\n\nIn the first place, no strong evacuating remedy must be given; for that,\nby carrying off the thinner parts of the juices, will tend to thicken\nthe remainder; and certainly encrease the distemper. No acrid medicine\nmust be directed, for that may act too hastily, dissolve the impacted\nmatter at once, and let it loose, to the destruction of the sufferer; no\nantimonial, no mercurial, no martial preparation must be taken; in\nshort, no chymistry: nature is the shop that heaven has set before us,\nand we must seek our medicine there. The venerable ancients, who knew\nnot this new art, will lead us in the search; and (faithful relators as\nthey are of truth) will tell us whence we may deduce our hope; and what\nwe are to fear.\n\nBut prior to the course of any medicine, and as an essential to any good\nhope from it, the patient must prescribe himself a proper course of\nlife, and a well chosen diet: let us assist him in his choice; and speak\nof this first, as it comes first in order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VI. - Rules of Life for Hypochondriac Persons.\n\n\nAir and exercise, as they are the best preservers of health, and\ngreatest assistants in the cure of all long continued diseases, will\nhave their full effect in this; but there requires some caution in the\nchoice, and management of them. It is common to think the air of high\ngrounds best; but experience near home shews otherwise: the\nHypochondriac patient is always worse at Highgate even than in London.\n\nThe air he breathes should be temperate; not exposed to the utmost\nviolences of heat and cold, and the swift changes from one to the\nother; which are most felt on those high grounds. The side of a hill is\nthe best place for him: and though wet grounds are hurtful; yet let\nthere be the shade of trees, to tempt him often to a walk; and soften by\ntheir exhalation the over dryness of the air.\n\nThe exercise he takes should be frequent; but not violent. Motion\npreserves the firmness of the parts, and elasticity of the vessels; it\nprevents that aggregation of thick humours which he is most to fear. A\nsedentary life always produces weakness, and that mischief always\nfollows: weak eyes are gummy, weak lungs are clogged with phlegm, and\nweak bowels waste themselves in vapid diarrhoeas.\n\nLet him invite himself abroad, and let his friends invite him by every\ninnocent inducement. For me, I should advise above all other things the\nstudy of nature. Let him begin with plants: he will here find a\ncontinual pleasure, and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful\nthings; even of the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to\nwalk; and every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket,\nwill afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually\nin the air, and continually to change the nature and quality of the air,\nby visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the lawn, the\nheath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be abroad; and the\nunceasing variety of the subjects of his observation, will prevent his\nwalking hastily: he will pursue his studies in the air; and that\ncontemplative turn of mind, which in his closet threatened his\ndestruction, will thus become the great means of his recovery.\n\nIf the mind tire upon this, from the repeated use, another of nature's\nkingdoms opens itself at once upon him; the plant he is weary of\nobserving, feeds some insect he may examine; nor is there a stone that\nlies before his foot, but may afford instruction and amusement.\n\nEven what the vulgar call the most abject things will shew a wonderful\nutility; and lead the mind, in pious contemplation higher than the\nstars. The poorest moss that is trampled under foot, has its important\nuses: is it at the bottom of a wood we find it? why there it shelters\nthe fallen seeds; hides them from birds, and covers them from frost;\nand thus becomes the foster father of another forest! creeps it along\nthe surface of a rock? even there its good is infinite! its small roots\nrun into the stone, and the rains make their way after them; the moss\nhaving lived its time dies; it rots and with the mouldered fragments of\nthe stone forms earth; wherein, after a few successions, useful plants\nmay grow, and feed more useful cattle!\n\nIs there a weed more humble in its aspect, more trampled on, or more\ndespised than knot grass! no art can get the better of its growth, no\nlabour can destroy it; 'twere pity if they could, for the thing lives\nwhere nothing would of use to us; and its large and most wonderfully\nabundant seeds, feed in hard winters, half the birds of Heaven.\n\nWhat the weak moss performs upon the rock the loathed toadstool brings\nabout in timber: is an oak dead where man's eye will not find it? this\nfungus roots itself upon the bark, and rots the wood beneath it; hither\nthe beetle creeps for shelter, and for sustenance; him the woodpecker\nfollows as his prey; and while he tears the tree in search of him, he\nscatters it about the ground; which it manures.\n\nNor is it the beetle alone that thus insinuates itself into the\nsubstance of the vegetable tribe: the tender aphide, whom a touch\ndestroys, burrows between the two skins of a leaf, for shelter from his\nwinged enemies; tracing, with more than Dedal\u00e6an art, his various\nmeanders; and veining the green surface with these white lines more\nbeautifully than the best \u00c6gyptian marble.\n\n'Twere endless to proceed; nor is it needful: one object will not fail\nto lead on to another, and every where the goodness of his God will\nshine before him even in what are thought the vilest things; his\ngreatness in the lead of them.\n\nLet him pursue these thoughts, and seek abroad the objects and the\ninstigations to them: but let him in these and all other excursions\navoid equally the dews of early morning, and of evening.\n\nThe more than usual exercise of this prescription will dispose him to\nmore than customary sleep, let him indulge it freely; so far from\nhurting, it will help his cure.\n\nLet him avoid all excesses: drink need scarce be named, for we are\nwriting to men of better and of nobler minds, than can be tempted to\nthat humiliating vice. Those who in this disorder have too great an\nappetite, must not indulge it; much eaten was never well digested: but\nof all excesses the most fatal in this case is that of venery. It is the\nexcess we speak of.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VII. - The proper DIET.\n\n\nIn the first place acids must be avoided carefully; and all things that\nare in a state of fermentation, for they will breed acidity. Provisions\nhardened by salting never should be tasted; much less those cured by\nsmoaking, and by salting. Bacon is indigestible in an Hypochondriac\nstomach; and hams, impregnated as is now the custom, with acid fumes\nfrom the wood fires over which they are hung, have that additional\nmischief.\n\nMilk ought to be a great article in the diet: and even in this there\nshould be choice. The milk of grass-fed cows has its true quality: no\nother. There are a multitude of ways in which this may be made a part\nboth of our foods and drinks, and they should all be used.\n\nThe great and general caution is that the diet be at all times of a kind\nloosening and gently stimulating; light but not acrid. Veal, lamb,\nfowls, lobsters, crabs, craw-fish, fresh water fish and mutton broth,\nwith plenty of boiled vegetables, are always right; and give enough\nvariety.\n\nRaw vegetables are all bad: sour wines, old cheese, and bottled beer are\nthings never to be once tasted. Indeed much wine is wrong, be it of what\nkind soever. It is the first of cordials; and as such I would have it\ntaken in this disease when it is wanted: plainly as a medicine, rather\nthan a part of diet. Malt liquor carefully chosen is certainly the best\ndrink. This must be neither new, nor tending to sourness; perfectly\nclear, and of a moderate strength: it is the native liquor of our\ncountry, and the most healthful.\n\nToo much tea weakens; and even sugar is in this disorder hurtful: but\nhoney may supply its place in most things; and this is not only harmless\nbut medicinal; a very powerful dissolvent of impacted humours, and a\ngreat deobstruent.\n\nWhat wine is drank should be of some of the sweet kinds. Old Hock has\nbeen found on enquiry to yield more than ten times the acid of the sweet\nwines; and in red Port, at least in what we are content to call so,\nthere is an astringent quality, that is most mischievous in these cases:\nit is said there is often alum in it: how pregnant with mischief that\nmust be to persons whose bowels require to be kept open, is most\nevident. Summer fruits perfectly ripe are not only harmless but\nmedicinal; but if eaten unripe they will be very prejudicial. A light\nsupper, which will leave an appetite for a milk breakfast, is always\nright; this will not let the stomach be ravenous for dinner, as it is\napt to be in those who make that their only meal.\n\nOne caution more must be given, and it may seem a strange one: it is\nthat the patient attend regularly to his hours of eating. We have to do\nwith men for the most part whose soul is the great object of their\nregard; but let them not forget they have a body.\n\nThe late Dr. STUKELY has told me, that one day by appointment visiting\nSir ISAAC NEWTON, the servant told him, he was in his study. No one was\npermitted to disturb him there; but as it was near dinner time, the\nvisitor sat down to wait for him. After a time dinner was brought in; a\nboil'd chicken under a cover. An hour pass'd, and Sir ISAAC did not\nappear. The doctor eat the fowl, and covering up the empty dish, bad\nthem dress their master another. Before that was ready, the great man\ncame down; he apologiz'd for his delay, and added, \"give me but leave to\ntake my short dinner, and I shall be at your service; I am fatigued and\nfaint.\" Saying this, he lifted up the cover; and without any emotion,\nturned about to STUKELY with a smile; \"See says he, what we studious\npeople are, I forgot I had din'd.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VIII. - The MEDICINE.\n\n\n'Tis the ill fate of this disease, more than of all others to be\nmisunderstood at first, and thence neglected; till the physician shakes\nhis head at a few first questions. None steals so fatally upon the\nsufferer: its advances are by very slow degrees; but every day it grows\nmore difficult of cure.\n\nThat this obstruction in the spleen is the true malady, the cases\nrelated by the antients, present observation, and the unerring\ntestimonies of dissections leave no room to doubt. Being understood, the\npath is open where to seek a remedy: and our best guides in this, as in\nthe former instance, will be those venerable Greeks; who saw a thousand\nof these cases, where we see one; and with less than half our theory,\ncured twice as many patients.\n\nOne established doctrine holds place in all these writers; that whatever\nby a hasty fermentation dissolves the impacted matter of the\nobstruction, and sends it in that state into the blood, does incredible\nmischief: but that whatever medicine softens it by slow degrees, and, as\nit melts, delivers it to the bowels without disturbance; will cure with\nequal certainty and safety.\n\nFor this good purpose, they knew and tried a multitude of herbs; but in\nthe end they fixed on one: and on their repeated trials of this, they\nbanished all the rest. This stood alone for the cure of the disease; and\nfrom its virtue received the name of SPLEEN-WORT. O wise and happy\nGreeks! authors of knowledge and perpetuators of it! With them the very\nname they gave a plant declared its virtues: with us, a writer calls a\nplant from some friend; that the good gardener who receives the honour,\nmay call another by his name who gave it. We now add the term smooth\nto this herb, to distinguish it from another, called by the same general\nterm, though not much resembling it.\n\nThe virtues of this smooth Spleen-wort have flood the test of ages; and\nthe plant every where retained its name and credit: and one of our good\nherbalists, who had seen a wonderful case of a swoln spleen, so big, and\nhard as to be felt with terror, brought back to a state of nature by it;\nand all the miserable symptoms vanish; thought Spleen-wort not enough\nexpressive of its excellence; but stamp'd on it the name of MILT-WASTE.\n\nIn the Greek Islands now, the use of it is known to every one; and even\nthe lazy monks who take it, are no longer splenetic. In the west of\nEngland, the rocks are stripped of it with diligence; and every old woman\ntells you how charming that leaf is for bookish men: in Russia they use\na plant of this kind in their malt liquor: it came into fashion there\nfor the cure of this disease; which from its constant use is scarce\nknown any longer; and they suppose 'tis added to their liquor for a\nflavour.\n\nThe ancients held it in a kind of veneration; and used what has been\ncalled a superstition in the gathering it. It was to be taken up with a\nsharp knife, without violence, and laid upon the clean linen: no time\nbut the still darkness of the night was proper, and even the moon was\nnot to shine upon it. I know they have been ridiculed for this; for\nnothing is so vain as learned ignorance: but let me be permitted once to\nvindicate them.\n\nThe plant has leaves that can close in their sides; and their under part\nis covered thick with a yellow powder, consisting of the seeds, and seed\nvessels: in these they knew the virtue most resided: this was the golden\ndust they held so valuable; and this they knew they could not be too\ncautious to preserve. They were not ignorant of the sleep of plants; a\nmatter lately spoken of by some, as if a new discovery; and being\nsensible that light, a dry air, an expanded leaf, and a tempestuous\nseason, were the means of losing this fine dust; and knowing also that\ndarkness alone brought on that closing of the leaf which thence has\nbeen called sleep; and which helped to defend and to secure it, they\ntherefore took such time, and used such means as could best preserve the\nplant entire; and even save what might be scattered from it.--And now\nwhere is their superstition?\n\nFrom this plant thus collected they prepared a medicine, which in a\ncourse of forty days scarce ever failed to make a perfect cure.\n\nWe have the plant wild with us; and till the fashion of rough chemical\npreparations took off our attention from these gentler remedies, it was\nin frequent use and great repute. I trust it will be so again: and many\nthank me for restoring it to notice.\n\nSpleen-wort gives out its virtues freely in a tincture; and a small dose\nof this, mixing readily with the blood and juices, gradually dissolves\nthe obstruction; and by a little at a time delivers its contents to be\nthrown off without pain, from the bowels. Let this be done while the\nviscera are yet sound and the cure is perfect. More than the forty days\nof the Greek method is scarce ever required; much oftener two thirds of\nthat time suffice; and every day, from the first dose of it, the patient\nfeels the happy change that is growing in his constitution. His food no\nmore turns putrid on his stomach, but yields its healthful nourishment.\n\nThe swelling after meals therefore vanishes; and with that goes the\nlowness, and anxiety, the difficult breath, and the distracting cholick:\nhe can bear the approach of rainy weather without pain; he finds himself\nmore apt for motion, and ready to take that exercise which is to be\nassistant in his cure; life seems no longer burthensome. His bowels get\ninto the natural condition of health, and perform their office once at\nleast a day; better if a little more: the dull and dead colour of his\nskin goes off, his lips grow red again, and every sign of health\nreturns.\n\nLet him who takes the medicine, say whether any thing here be\nexaggerated. Let him, if he pleases to give himself the trouble, talk\nover with me, or write to me, this gradual decrease of his complaints,\nas he proceeds in his cure. My uncertain state of health does not\npermit me to practise physic in the usual way, but I am very desirous to\ndo what good I can, and shall never refuse my advice, such as it may be,\nto any person rich or poor, in whatever manner he may apply for it. I\nshall refer him to no apothecary, whose bills require he should be\ndrenched with potions; but tell him, in this as in all other cases,\nwhere to find some simple herb; which he may if he please prepare\nhimself; or if he had rather spare that trouble, may have it so prepared\nfrom me.\n\nWith regard to Spleen-wort, no method of using it is more effectual than\nsimply taking it in powder; the only advantage of a tincture, is that a\nproper dose may be given, and yet the stomach not be loaded with so\nlarge a quantity: it is an easier and pleasanter method, and nothing\nmore.\n\nIf any person choose to take it in the other way, I should still wish\nhim once at least to apply to me; that he may be assured what he is\nabout to take is the right plant. Abuses in medicines are at this time\nvery great, and in no instance worse than what relates to herbs. The\nbest of our physicians have complained upon this head with warmth, but\nwithout redress: they know the virtues and the value of many of our\nnative plants, but dread to prescribe them; lest some wrong thing should\nbe administered in their place; perhaps inefficacious, perhaps\nmischievous, nay it may be fatal. The few simple things I direct are\nalways before me; and it will at all times be a pleasure to me, in this\nand any other instance, to see whether what any person is about to take\nbe right. I have great obligations to the public, and this is the best\nreturn that I know how to make.\n\nTo see the need of such a caution, hear a transaction but of yesterday!\n\nAn intelligent person was directed to go to the medicinal herb shops in\nthe several markets, and buy some of this Spleen-wort; the name was\nwritten, and shewn to every one; every shop received his money, and\nalmost every one sold a different plant, under the name of this: but\nwhat is very striking, not one of them the right. Such is the chance of\nhealth in those hands through which the best means of it usually pass;\neven in the most regular course of application.\n\nI would not be understood to limit the little services I may this way be\nable to render the afflicted, to this single instance; much less to\npropose to myself any advantages from it. Whoever pleases will be\nwelcome to me, upon any such occasion; and whatever be the herb on which\nhe places a dependance, he shall be shewn it growing. I once recommended\na garden to be established for this use, at the public expence: one\ngreat person has put it in my power to answer all its purposes.\n\n                        F  I  N  I  S.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris, he was\n\"nominated\" to the Academy. He had but to present an Historical\nPainting in order to take his seat as an Academician.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VENUS AND MARRIAGE\n\n\nBack in his beloved Paris again; thrilled by the atmosphere and gaiety\nof its merry life; in the full vigour of manhood on the eve of his\nthirties; amongst congenial friends; done with the drudgery of winning\nto Academic honour, Boucher saw that the public were not falling over\neach other to purchase religious or historic pictures; he straightway\nturned his back upon these things, and on the edge of his thirtieth\nyear he gave to the world his \"Marriage of the Children of God with\nthe Children of Men,\" in which Venus is the avowed mistress of his\nadoration. It caused a fine stir, and greatly increased his repute.\n\nIn this picture he ends his Italian period and strikes his own\npersonal note. Both this and the \"Venus asking arms for Aeneas from\nVulcan,\" together with the \"Birth of Adonis\" and the \"Death of\nAdonis,\" of about the same period, still show Boucher strongly under\nthe influence of his master, Lemoyne. Indeed, the \"Birth\" and \"Death\nof Adonis,\" their record lost during the scuffle and confusion of the\nRevolution, for long hung side by side as pictures by Lemoyne, until,\nbeing cleaned about 1860, Boucher's initials were discovered upon\nthem, and, contemporary engravings being hunted up, still further\nproved their origin. But in the Venus that now figures in all his\nworks there is that flesh-painting of the nude, and that rosy touch\nupon the flesh of the female figure, that are a far more certain\nsignature of Boucher's handiwork than any written name.\n\nUnfortunately the Salons were closed during Boucher's earlier years\nuntil he was thirty-four, and the record of his work during these\nyears is difficult to follow; but with his service to Venus his\npersonal career begins, and the stream of his Venus-pieces steadily\nflows from his hands.\n\nHe came to her service rid of all prentice essays in craftsmanship, a\nfinished and consummate artist. He found in his subject a goddess to\nwhom he could devote his great and splendid gifts. He painted her\ndainty body with a radiant delight and a rare colour-sense such as\nFrance had never before seen or uttered. He remains to this day the\nfirst painter of the subtle, delicate, and elusive thing that is\nfemininity; he caught her allure, her charm, as he was to catch the\nfragrance and charm of children and flowers; and he set the statement\nof these things upon canvas as they have never been uttered.\n\nThe whole of his life long, Boucher gave himself up with equal and\npassionate devotion to work and to pleasure--working at his easel\noften twelve hours of his day without losing, to the end when the\nbrush fell from his dead fingers, his blitheness of heart or his\ngenerosity of act, and without weakening the pleasure-loving desires\nof his gadding spirit. Out of his splendid toil he made the means to\nindulge his tastes for pleasure; and the gratifying of his tastes in\nturn renewed and created the ideas that made the subjects of his\nartistry. He brought to all he did a joy in the doing that made of his\nvast labour one long pleasure--of his pleasures a riot of industry. He\nplayed as he toiled, scarce knowing which was play and which toil.\n\nThe gossip of his love-affairs makes no romantic story--they were but\ncommonplace ecstasies with unknown frail women. But hard as he worked\nand lived and played, he found time to get himself married in his\nthirtieth year to pretty seventeen-year-old Marie Jeanne Buseau, a\nlittle Parisian--and for love of her, so far as he understood the\nbusiness; for she brought him no dowry.\n\nThe young couple settled down for the next ten years in the Rue\nSaint-Thomas-du-Louvre. Here Boucher lived through his thirties.\n\nMadame was a pretty creature, if we had but Latour's pastel portrait\nalone to prove it. But the pretty features were the crown to as pretty\na body, for she sat often to her lord; and it is clear from his\ncorrespondence with a friend, Bachaumont, that she is the Psyche of\nhis illustrated fable--and Psyche runs much to the Altogether.\n\nMarriage, however, was not likely to imprison Boucher's gadding eyes;\nand it did not. Madame Boucher seems to have had as frail a heart, and\navoided strife by amusing herself, amongst others, with the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who, to gain access to the lady,\ncommissioned Boucher to do the Watteau-like illustrations to\nAcajou--a dull affair. Boucher's pretty wife, herself no mean\nartist, worked in his studio, and painted several smaller canvases\nafter his pictures, gaining some fame as a miniaturist and engraver.\n\nNor did Marriage turn Boucher from his art. Two years were gone by\nsince his nomination to the Academy; he had now to paint the formal\nHistorical Picture and present it in order to take his seat as\nAcademician; and it was in this his thirtieth year that he painted and\nwon his academic rank with the \"Renauld et Armide\" now at the Louvre.\n\nHere he sufficiently subordinated his own style to the academic to\nensure success; and the work was hailed by Academicians and critics,\nincluding Diderot, with enthusiasm. But even here we have his cupids\npeeping round the mythologic event; and Armide herself has pretty\nFrench lips that knew no Greek.\n\nOnce secure of his position, he straightway flung the last remnants of\nthe academic style out of his studio door; and it is a grim comment on\ncriticism that it was just exactly in proportion as he developed his\nown personal genius and uttered the France of his day, that he was\nattacked; whilst the stilted things that he knew were third-rate, and\nwhich he wholly rejected from henceforth, were exactly the things that\nwere praised!\n\nHis election to the Academy, and the enthusiasm over the picture that\nwon him his seat thereat, brought his name before the young king; the\nfollowing year he received his first order from the Court whose\npainter he was destined to become. The decorations in the queen's\napartments were gloomy and had grown black; and he painted in their\nstead the \"Charity,\" \"Abundance,\" \"Fidelity,\" and \"Prudence\" still\nthere to be seen. Indeed, with his gay vision, his pretty habit of\nculling only the flowers from the garden of life, and his quickness to\nset down the pleasing thing in every prospect, Boucher was the\ndestined painter of a Court weary of pomposity and the pose of the\nmock-heroic, and which was wholly giving itself up to pleasure and the\nelegances.\n\nBut neither his new dignity of Academician nor the royal favour, kept\nhim from the bookshops; and he illustrated, with rare beauty and a\ncharm worthy of Watteau, the great edition of the Works of Moli\u00e8re\nin his thirty-first year. It is true that he made as free with\nMoli\u00e8re's world as with the Gods of Olympus; he peoples the plays with\ncharacters of his own day, arrayed in the dress and habit of that day,\nand moving in surroundings that he saw about him.\n\n\nLE MONDE QUI S'AMUSE\n\n\nThe Homely had come upon the town out of Holland, painted with most\nconsummate artistry by Chardin, and was soon in the vogue. Boucher had\na quick eye for the mode. And he straightway set himself to the\npainting of \"La Belle Cuisini\u00e8re.\" Still-life and homely subjects need\nan accuracy of realism and a Dutch sense of these things, a sense of\nsincerity and an appreciation of the dignity of the work-a-day life of\nthe people, in which Boucher was wholly lacking. Above all, it calls\nfor a sense of \"character,\" which, in Boucher, was always weak. It was\na sneer against him that his very broomsticks called for pompons and\nribbons--and there was more than a little truth in the spite. He is\nmore concerned with the accident of the kissing of a kitchen-maid than\nwith the kitchen's habit. He cannot even peep into a scullery without\ndragging in Venus by the skirts, and tricking her out in a\nproperty-wardrobe of a scullery-wench, in which the girl is clearly\nbut acting the part.\n\nHowever, these passing vogues and experiments in different methods\nwere only gay asides--he was working the while upon his own subjects;\nand, to the display by its several members ordered by the Academy, he\nsent four little paintings of fauns and cupids which won him the\nhonour of election as deputy-professor. His brain and hand were very\nbusy, and he turns from one thing to another with amazing facility,\nbringing distinction to all that he does.\n\nBut he painted about this time two pictures of infants, \"L'Amour\nOiseleur\" and \"L'Amour Moissonneur,\" which were the beginning of that\nhost of cupids that he let fly from his studio; they frolic across his\ncanvases and join the retinue of Venus, peeping out from clouds, over\nwaves, round curtains, painted with a perfection that has never been\nsurpassed in the portrayal of infants. He painted their round limbs,\ntheir lusty life, their delightful awkwardnesses, their jolly fat\ngrace, their na\u00efve surprise at life and glory in it, as they had never\nbeen painted before, and have never been painted since.\n\nHe also gave forth in this his thirty-third year a \"Pastoral\" and a\n\"Shepherd and Shepherdess in Conversation,\" with sheep about them and\nin a pleasant landscape, which were his first essays in the style that\nhe created and which made him famous.\n\nHis friend Meissonnier, the inventor of the rococo, stood godfather to\nBoucher's first-born son in the May of 1736.\n\nFrom the very beginning Boucher seems to have been engraved. And these\nengravings, done by the best gravers of his day, greatly extended his\nreputation and popularised him; he fully realised the value of the\nadvertisement as well as his profits from it. Before his thirty-third\nyear was run out he published his well-known \"Cries of Paris.\"\n\nBoucher's description of them, \"studies from the low classes,\" holds\nthe key to that something of failure to realise the dramatic verities\nthat is over all; it gives also the attitude of the France that he\nknew towards the France that he did not, and could not understand. He\ncreated that dainty, pleasant atmosphere that comes floating up to the\nwindows on a fresh morning in Paris from the musical cries of\nthe street vendors; but of the deeper significance of the\nstreet-sellers--of the miserable accent in their life, of their weary\ntoil, of the dignity of their labour--he knew nothing; his brush could\nnot refrain from making elegance and fine manners peep from behind the\nstreet-porter's fustian or the milkmaid's skirt.\n\nBut his thirty-third year was to contain a more far-reaching\nsignificance even than the creation of his cupid-pieces and pastorals.\n\nThe \"Cries of Paris\" were scarce printed when Boucher's illustration\nto \"Don Quixote\" appeared--\"Sancho pursued by the servants of the\nDuke.\" This design was to have far-reaching results that Boucher\nlittle suspected.\n\nThe painter Oudry had been called to the conduct of the great tapestry\nlooms at Beauvais a couple of years before; and in his efforts to\nfurnish the looms with good designs, he now called Boucher to his aid,\nwhose original and fresh style, colour, and arrangement, together with\nhis personal vision, and the enthusiasm and zeal with which he threw\nhimself into the work, at once increased the reputation and the\nproducts of the famous looms. This large designing for the tapestries\nwas, in return, of immense value to the development of the genius of\nthe man, enlarging his breadth of style and giving scope to that great\ndecorative sense that was his superb gift. Thenceforth he was destined\nto play a supreme part in the history of the world-famed factories. He\nnow produced painting after painting for the Beauvais looms.\n\nLife is now one long triumph for Boucher, only disturbed in this year\nby the sad news of the suicide of his old master, Lemoyne. It was in\nthis, Boucher's thirty-fourth year, that the Salon was opened for the\nfirst time since Boucher's infancy, and he contributed several\ncanvases to it.\n\nRigaud, the old Academician, now close upon eighty, straggling through\nthe great galleries, might well blink and gasp at the change that had\ncome over French art since he last exhibited there, thirty-three years\ngone by; but his scoffs and regrets held no terrors for the younger\nAcademicians gathered about. He stood in a new world. A new generation\nwas in possession. The grand manner, the severe etiquette, formal\nmock-heroics, and solemn pomposity of Louis the Fourteenth were\nvanished, and the Agreeable and the Pleasant Make-Believe of Louis the\nFifteenth reigned in their stead. Old Rigaud might blink indeed! Just\nas the imposing and stilted etiquette of the reception-room had given\nplace to the easy manners and airy etiquette of the dainty boudoir, so\nhad light chatter and gay wit and the quick repartee usurped the heavy\nsplendours of a consequential age. France, weary of an eternal pose of\nthe grand manner, was seeking change in joyousness and amusement.\n\nGallantry and gaiety were become the object of the ambition of a\ndandified and elegant day. France became a coquette; dressed herself\nas a porcelain shepherdess; and with beribboned crook and sheep,\nseeking pleasant prospects to stroll through, gave herself to\ndalliance--her powder-puff and patch-box and fan a serious part of her\nunseriousness.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE CH\u00c2TEAUROUX\n\n\nAt thirty-five Boucher has arrived. He is in the vogue; in favour at\nCourt--as well as in the fashion. In his three years from taking his\nseat at the Academy to the opening of the first Salon he has created a\nnew and original style--his cupid pieces, his pastorals, his\nVenus-pieces, his tapestry. Boucher's kingdom lay in the realm of the\ndecorative painter--and he has found it. Torn from the surroundings\nfor which he designed them, as part and parcel of the general scheme,\nhis pictures are as out of place as an Italian altarpiece in an\nEnglish dining-room, yet they suffer less. Several may still be seen,\nas he set them up in frames of his own planning, as overdoors in the\npalace of the Soubise, now given up to the national archives.\n\nThe ghost of the Prince of Soubise, who commissioned them, may haunt\nhis palace, but his kin know the place no longer. The overdoors\nwrought by Boucher's skill look down now on the nation's collection of\nhistoric documents. The \"Three Graces enchaining Love,\" the fine\npastoral of \"The Cage,\" and the pastoral of the \"Shepherd placing a\nRose in his Shepherdess's Hair,\" were to see a mightier change than\nthe usurpation of Louis the Fourteenth's pompous age by the elegant\nyears of Louis the Fifteenth. But this was not as yet. Here at least\nwe see Boucher's art rid of all outside influences, and at the full\ntide of creation; here we have the inimitable lightness of touch, the\nfigures and landscape bathed in the airy volume of atmosphere.\n\nHe seems at this time to have played with pastel, due probably to his\nfriendship with Latour, who sent a portrait of Boucher's wife to this\nSalon. Boucher showed in the use of chalks the artistry and skill that\nwere always at his command.\n\nHe also was putting to its full use his innate sense of landscape,\nraising to high achievement that astonishing balance of landscape and\nfigures in his design--a balance that has never been surpassed; his\nfigures never override his landscape; his landscape never overpowers\nhis figures. His earnest counsels to his pupils and his constant\ndeploring of the lack of the landscape art in France prove the great\nstress he laid upon it.\n\nThe designing of a frontispiece for the catalogue of a personal\nfriend, one Gersaint, a merchant of oriental wares, started Boucher in\nhis thirty-third year upon that series of Chinese pictures and\ntapestries known as the \"Chinoiseries,\" in which he frittered away\nonly too many precious hours, for they were received with great favour\nby the public. The paintings of Chinese subjects designed for the\nlooms of Beauvais are still to be seen at Besan\u00e7on.\n\nBut busy as were his brain and hand in the exercise of his wide and\nversatile gifts, pouring out \"Chinoiseries,\" illustrations for books,\ntapestries on a large scale, landscapes, models for the gilt bronze\ndecorations of porcelain vases, scheming handsome frames for his\npictures, designing furniture and fans--Boucher was true, above all,\n\"to his goddess,\" and painted the famed \"Birth of Venus,\" which,\nthanks to the Swedish Ambassador's fondness for Madame Boucher, now\nhangs at Stockholm; our amorous Count de Tessin, to be just, seems to\nhave had a rare flair for the artistic--besides artist's wives. It was\non the 15th of April in 1742, the last year of his thirties, that the\nRoyal favour was marked by the grant of a pension of 400 livres\n(double florins) to Boucher with promise of early benefits to follow.\n\nTwo years afterwards it was raised to 600 livres.\n\nThis was the year that he painted the beautiful canvas of \"Diana\nleaving the Bath with one of her Companions,\" now at the Louvre. It\nwas also the year that saw his landscape, the \"Hamlet of Iss\u00e9\" at the\nSalon. This \"Hameau d'Iss\u00e9\" was to be enlarged for the Opera, proving\nhim to be decorator there, where he was arranging waterfalls,\ncascades, and the rest of the pretty business, without staying his\nhand from his art.\n\nAt forty Boucher has come into his kingdom. The ten years of these\nforties were to be a vast triumph for him. He was to produce\nmasterpiece after masterpiece. His art had caught the taste of the\nday. He was at the height of his powers. He had done great things--he\nwas to do greater. During these ten years of his forties he poured\nforth vivid and glowing works of sustained power and originality.\n\nWe have a picture of him as he was in the flesh at this time--the\npastel portrait by Lundberg, now at the Louvre--a gay, somewhat\ndissipated, handsomely dressed dandy of the time, smiling out of his\ncareless day, the debonnair man of fashion, the laughing eyes showing\nsigns of the night carousals, which were the rest from the prodigious\ntoil of this vital and forthright spirit.\n\nIt was in this our artist's fortieth year that the gifted old Cardinal\nFleury, who had guided the fortunes of France with rare skill, died,\nbroken by his ninety years and the blunders of the disastrous war that\nhe had so strenuously opposed; and Louis, essaying the strut of\nkingship, became king by act. His indolent character, unequal to the\nmighty business, his indeterminate will fretted by the set of\nquarrelling and intriguing rogues that he gathered about him as his\nministers, he fell into the habit that became his thenceforth, the\nonly thing to which he paid the tribute of constancy--he ruled France\nfrom behind pretty petticoats. He had early shown the adulterous blood\nof his great-grandfather; two, if not three, of five sisters of the\nnoble and historic house of De Nesle had yielded to his gadding fancy;\nthe youngest now ousted her sister De Mailly from the king's favour,\nwas publicly acknowledged as the king's mistress, and became Duchess\nof Ch\u00e2teauroux. Boucher painted her handsome being as a shepherdess in\none of his pastorals. She was no ordinary toy of a king. A woman of\ntalent, with hot ambitions for the king's majesty, fired with the\npride of race of the old French noblesse, it was during her short\nyears of ascendancy over the king that he roused from his body's\ntorpor and made an effort to reach the dignity and eminence befitting\nto the lord of a great and gallant people. He stepped forth awhile\nfrom his drunken bouts and manifold mean adulteries, and set himself\nat the head of the army in Flanders, and strutted it as conqueror.\n\nPoor Ch\u00e2teauroux only got the hate of the people for reward, Louis the\nhonours; for the people resented the public dishonour of her state.\n\nPower she found to be a dead-sea apple in her pretty mouth. The glory\nof it all, the splendours, were not the easily won delights for which\nshe had looked. She had to fight a duel, that never ended, with the\nking's witty, crafty, and scurrilous Prime Minister, the notorious\nMaurepas--and Maurepas willed that no woman should ever come between\nhim and the king--Maurepas who knew no mercy, no decency, no chivalry,\nno scruple. At Ch\u00e2teauroux's urging, Louis placed himself at the\nhead of the army; and France went near mad with joy that she had\nagain found a king. Crafty Maurepas urged on the business; the\nCh\u00e2teauroux suddenly realised his cunning glee--it separated her from\nthe king.\n\nOut of the whirl of things Boucher's fortune was ripening, little as\nhe might suspect it.\n\nHe was painting masterpieces that make his name live. To his fortieth\nyear belong the famed \"Birth of Venus,\" the \"Venus leaving the Bath,\"\nthe \"Muse Clio,\" the \"Muse Melpomene,\" and the three well-known\npastorals now at the Louvre--\"The Sleeping Shepherdess,\" the \"Nest,\"\n\n\nand the \"Shepherd and Shepherdesses.\" Of the many famous Venus-pieces\nthat his hand painted during these years it is not easy to write the\nlist. But having signed the \"Marriage of Love and Psyche\" at\nforty-one, he turned his experimental hand to the homely, realistic\nDutch style that was having a wide vogue, and painted the\n\"Dejeuner\"--a family of the prosperous class of the day at\nbreakfast--showing with rare charm the surroundings and home life of\nthe well-to-do of his time.\n\nAll goes well with Boucher. He changes into better quarters in the Rue\nde Grenelle-Saint-Honor\u00e9, where he lived for the next five years,\nuntil 1749; but his eyes are fixed upon a studio and apartments at\nthe old palace of the Louvre, though the hard intriguing of his\npowerful friends at Court on his behalf failed for some time. He had,\nindeed, to make another move before he arrived at his longed-for goal.\n\nPensions Boucher, like others, had found to be somewhat empty affairs;\nbut rooms at the Louvre were a solid possession eagerly sought after\nby the artists.\n\nIn this year of 1744 Boucher created a new fashion at the annual Salon\nby sending studies and sketches instead of finished pictures; and it\nset a value upon such things not before realised by artists, for\nsuccess was instant and loud.\n\nTowards the end of the next, Boucher's forty-second year, the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who was to take his leave of Paris,\ncommissioned four pictures to represent the day of a woman of fashion,\nand to be entitled \"Morning,\" \"Midday,\" \"Evening,\" and \"Night.\"\n\nBoucher painted one of these for him, now known as the \"Marchande de\nModes.\" The others were painted later, and all had a wide vogue as\nengravings. The correspondence has interest since it reveals Boucher's\nbusiness habits; he was paid for a picture on its delivery, and for\neach of these he was to receive 600 livres (double florins or\ndollars)--about a hundred and twenty pounds.\n\nIn an official document of the Director of Buildings to the king (or\nMinister of Fine Art, as we should say), written in this year of 1745,\nBoucher being forty-two, is a \"list of the best painters,\" in which\nBoucher is singled out for distinction as \"an historic painter, living\nin the Rue de Grenelle-Saint-Honor\u00e9, opposite the Rue des Deux-Ecus,\npupil of Lemoyne, excelling also in landscape, grotesques, and\nornaments in the manner of Watteau; and equally skilled in painting\nflowers, fruit, architecture, and subjects of gallantry and of\nfashion.\"\n\nNot so bad for dry officialdom; the critics could learn a lesson. For\nhe was nothing less. What indeed does he not do? and wondrous well!\nthis painter of the age.\n\nAnd the mighty rush of events is about to sweep him into further\nprominence; the very things which he probably passed by with a gay\nshrug are to enrich him, to help him to his highest fulfilment.\n\nPoor Ch\u00e2teauroux saw that she must lose the king's gadding favour in\nthe conflict with Maurepas unless she joined her lord, now with the\narmy. She realised full well that she had created the new Louis of\nAmbition--that her going must bring the people's hate to her. But she\ndared not lose the king. And she went. Maurepas had overdone his\njibings. The indiscretion at once rang through the land; became the\njest of the army--and Maurepas was not far from the bottom of the\nbusiness. The discreet indiscretion of covered ways between the king's\nlodgings and hers only added to the mockeries, and increased the\npeople's hate against, of course, the Ch\u00e2teauroux. Then upon a day in\nAugust the small-pox seized Louis at Metz; poor Ch\u00e2teauroux fought for\npossession of the king in the sick room, until his fear of\ndeath--Louis' sole piety--sent her packing--shrinking back in the\nhired carriage at each halting-place for change of horses, lest she\nshould be seen and torn from her place and destroyed by the populace.\n\nBut Louis recovered; Paris rang with bells at joy on his recovery, and\nhe entered the city amidst mad enthusiasm, hailed as The Well-Beloved.\n\nHe sent for the Ch\u00e2teauroux to find her dying, Maurepas having to\ndeliver the message of recall. She died suddenly and in great agony,\nswearing that Maurepas had poisoned her--died in the arms of her poor\ndiscarded sister, the De Mailly.\n\nBut this year of 1745 Boucher hears a mightier scandal that is to mean\nvast things to all France--and not least of all to Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE POMPADOUR\n\n\nA young bride had become the gossip of the rich merchant society of\nParis--that class that was ousting the old noblesse from power. She\nwas a beautiful, a remarkable woman; her wit was repeated in the\ndrawing-rooms, she had all the accomplishments; her charming\nname--Madame Lenormant d'Etioles.\n\nDraw aside the curtains of the past and we discover our little Jeanne\nPoisson--grown into this exquisite creature. It has come about in\nstrange fashion enough. The father--a scandalous fellow--having\nfingered the commissariat moneys in ugly ways to his own use, had been\nbanished for the ugly business. Nor is Jeanne's mother any better than\nshe should be; and the wags wink knowingly at the handsome and rich\nman of fashion, Monsieur Lenormant de Tournehem, who has been the\nfavoured gallant during the absence of the light-fingered Poisson.\n\nAnd, of a truth, Lenormant de Tournehem takes astonishing interest in\nthe little Jeanne--watching over her up-growing and giving her the\nbest of education at the convent, where she wins all hearts, and is\nknown as \"the little queen.\" The truth spoken with wondrous prophecy,\nif unthinkingly, as we shall see. Complacent Poisson came home, and\ntook the rich and fashionable, bland and smiling Lenormant de\nTournehem to his arms. Has he not wealth and estates? therefore as\nexcellent a friend for Poisson as for Madame Poisson. The girl Jeanne\nleaves the convent to be taught the accomplishments by the supreme\nmasters of France, the wits foregather at Madame Poisson's, and the\nbrilliant Jeanne is soon mistress of the arts--coquetry not least of\nall; has also the most exquisite taste in dress. Under all is a heart\ncold as steel; calculating as the higher mathematics. She has but one\nhindrance to ambition--her mean birth. Lenormant de Tournehem rids her\neven of this slur by making his nephew, Lenormant d'Etioles, marry\nher, giving the young couple half his fortune for dowry, and the\npromise of the rest when he dies--also he grants him a splendid\ntown-house, as splendid a country seat. And consequential\nself-respecting little Lenormant d'Etioles is lord of Etioles, amongst\nother seignories. So Jane Fish appears as Madame Lenormant d'Etioles,\nseductive, beautiful, accomplished, to whose house repair the new\nphilosophy, the wits, and artists. She has a certain sense of virtue;\nindeed openly vows that no one but the king shall ever come between\nher and her lord. But, deep in her heart, she has harboured a fierce\nambition--that the king shall help her to keep her bond. She puts\nforth all her gifts, all her powers, to win to the strange goal;\nconfides it to her worldly mother and \"uncle,\" Lenormant de Tournehem;\nfinds keen allies therein to the reaching of that strange goal. The\ndeath of the Ch\u00e2teauroux clears the way. At a masked ball the king is\nintrigued as to the personality of a beautiful woman who plagues him\nwith her art; he orders the unmasking. Madame Lenormant d'Etioles\nstands revealed, drops her handkerchief as by accident; the whisper\nruns through the Court that \"the handkerchief has been thrown!\" The\nking stoops and picks it up. A few evenings later she is smuggled into\nthe \"private apartments.\" She goes again a month later; in the morning\nis seized with sudden terror--she daren't go back to her angry lord\nlest he do her grievous harm; he will have missed her. The king is\ntouched; allows her to hide from henceforth in the secret apartments;\npromises the beautiful creature a lodging, her husband's banishment,\nand early acknowledgment as titular mistress--before the whole Court\nat Easter, says the pious Great One. But he has to join the army to\nplay the Conqueror at Fontenoy; and it is later in the year\n(September) before Madame d'Etioles is presented to the Court in a\nvast company and proceeds to the queen's apartments to kiss hands on\nappointment. Thus was Jeanne Poisson raised to the great aristocracy\nof France in her twenty-third year as Marquise de Pompadour.\n\nBoucher had been one of the brilliant group of artists of the\nd'Etioles' circle. That the Pompadour's influence had much effect upon\nhis position at Court for a year or two is unlikely; for she had to\nfight for possession of the king day and night, as the Ch\u00e2teauroux\nhad done, against the queen's party and the unscrupulous enmity of\nMaurepas. To set down Boucher's favour at Court to her is ridiculous.\n\nHe was painting for the queen's apartments at thirty-one when the\nPompadour was a school-girl of twelve. But in the year following her\nrise to power, Boucher painted four pictures for the large room of the\nDauphin, which were \"placed elsewhere\"; and, the year after that, he\nwas at work upon two pictures for the bedroom of the king at the\ncastle of Marly. It is likely enough that the Pompadour directed this\norder. She had almost immediately secured the office of the\nDirector-General of Buildings, which covered the direction of the\nroyal art treasures, for \"uncle\" Lenormant de Tournehem, who was also\na friend of the artist. And from this year it is significant that\nBoucher paints no more for the opposing camp of the Queen and Dauphin.\n\nHe was now giving all his strength to the \"Rape of Europa\" that he\npainted for the competition ordered by the Academy at the command of\nLenormant de Tournehem in the king's name, in which ten chosen\nAcademicians were to paint subjects in their own style for six prizes\nand a gold medal, to be awarded in secret vote by the competing\nartists themselves. Boucher won, by his amiable nature, the good-will\nof them all by proposing that they should so arrange as to share the\nprizes equally, and thus prevent any sense of soreness inevitable in\nthe losers.\n\nBut greatly as he won the good-fellowship of his fellow-artists by it,\nthis picture caused a murmur to rise amongst the critics who,\naforetime loud in his praise, now began to complain of his \"abuse of\nrose tints\" in the painting of the female nude. The fact was that\nDiderot and the men of the New Philosophy were turning their eyes to\nthe whole foundations upon which France was built, art as well as\nsociety, and were beginning to demand of art \"grandeur and morality in\nits subjects.\" They were soon to be clamouring for \"the statement of a\ngreat maxim, a lesson for the spectator.\" Diderot, with bull-like\ncourage, picked out the greatest, and turned upon Boucher, blaming him\nfor triviality.\n\nThe nations, weary of war, concluded the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in\nthe October of 1748. No sooner was peace concluded than Louis\nrelapsed into his old habit of dandified indolence and profligate\nease; and, putting from him his duties as the lord of a great people,\nhe gave himself up to shameless intrigues. He allowed the Pompadour to\nusurp his magnificence and to rule over the land. He yielded himself\nutterly, if sometimes sulkily, to her domination; and for sixteen\nyears she was the most powerful person at Court, the greatest force in\nthe state--making and unmaking ministers, disposing of office,\nhonours, titles, pensions. All political affairs were discussed and\narranged under her guidance; ministers, ambassadors, generals\ntransacted their business in her stately boudoirs; the whole patronage\nof the sovereign was dispensed by her pretty hands; the prizes of the\nChurch, of the army, of the magistracy could be obtained solely\nthrough her favour and good-will. Her energy must have been\nprodigious. Possessed of extraordinary talents and exquisite tastes,\nshe gave full rein to them, and it was in the indulgence of her better\nqualities that Destiny brought Boucher into the friendship of this\nwonderful woman. She became not only his patron but his pupil,\nengraving several of his designs.\n\nBut this, her sovereignty over the king, easy and light in its outward\nseeming, was a haggard nightmare to the calculating woman who had so\nlonged for it. She knew no single hour's rest from the night she won\nto the king's bed. She had to fight her enemies, secret and open, for\npossession of the king's will, day and night; and she fought--with\nrare courage. She won by consummate skill and unending pluck. She made\nherself an essential part of the king's freedom from care. The Court\nparty fought her for power with constant vigilance. Maurepas brought\nall his unscrupulous art, all his ironic mimicry, all his vile jibes\nand unchivalrous hatred to bear against her. He had made himself a\nnecessity to the king; and he never slept away a chance of injuring\nher. He knew no mercy, no nobility, no pity. He made her the detested\nobject of the people. With his own hands he penned the witty verses\nand epigrams that were sung and flung about the streets of Paris.\n\nBut she had an enemy more subtle than any at the Court--hour by hour\nshe had to dispute the king with the king's boredom. And it was in the\neffort to do so that she created her celebrated theatre in the\nprivate apartments, calling Boucher and others to her aid in the doing\nof it. Here the noblest of France vied with each other to obtain the\nsmallest part to play, an instrument in its orchestra, an invitation\nto its performances.\n\nBoucher left the Opera to become its decorator in 1748, and did not\nreturn until her death. For her, he also decorated her beautiful rooms\nat Bellevue. She bought at high prices many of his greatest\nmasterpieces.\n\nThe Pompadour's power so greatly increased that she openly took\ncommand of the king's will; dared and succeeded in getting his\nfavourite Maurepas banished; and herself took to the use of the kingly\n\"we.\" Her rascally father was created Lord of Marigny; her brother,\nwhom the king liked well and called \"little brother,\" was created\nMarquis de Vandi\u00e8res; her only child, Alexandrine, signed her name as\na princess of the blood royal, and would have been married to the\nblood royal had she not caught the small-pox and died. She amassed a\nprivate fortune, castles, and estates such as no mistress had dreamed\nof; and into them she poured art treasures that cost the nation\nthirty-six millions of money. She created the porcelain factory of\nS\u00e8vres, kept keen watch over the Gobelins looms, and founded the great\nMilitary School of St. Cyr amidst work that would have kept several\nstatesmen busy, and of deadly intrigues at Court that would have\nbroken the spirit of many a brilliant man.\n\nIt was in her hectic desire to keep the king from being bored that she\nstooped, and made Boucher stoop, to the employment of his high\nartistry in the painting of a series of indecent pictures wherewith to\ntickle the jaded desires of Boredom, and thereby gave rise to the\nwidespread impression that Boucher's art was ever infected by base\ndesign. But Boucher was, at his very worst, but a healthy animal; and\neven in these secret works for the king he did not reach so low as did\nmany an artist of more pious memory who painted with no excuse but his\nown pleasure.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the Pompadour has been blamed too much for this\nevil act, and too much forgotten for her splendid patronage of the man\nwho, under it and during these great years of his forties, produced a\nseries of masterpieces that place him in the foremost rank of the\npainters of his century. It is impossible to reckon the number of the\npastorals and Venus-pieces that his master-hand painted and loved to\npaint, during these the supreme years of his genius. It is significant\nthat they were painted during the years that saw the Pompadour in\nsupreme power.\n\nBoucher was so firmly established in 1750, his forty-seventh year,\nthat he moved into a new house in the Rue Richelieu, near the Palais\nRoyal. Disappointed in not receiving a studio and apartments at the\nLouvre, he was allowed to use a studio in the king's library. He was\nnow making money so easily that he was able to collect pictures and\nprecious stones and the gaily coloured curiosities that appealed to\nhis tastes.\n\nThe critics were becoming more and more censorious; and one of them\nhits true with the comment that in his pastorals his shepherdesses\nlook as if they had stepped over from the Opera and would soon be off\nagain thereto.\n\nIn his forty-eighth year Boucher's art was at its most luminous\nstage--his atmosphere clear and subtle and exquisitely rendered; his\nyellows golden; his whites satin-like and silvery; his flesh-tones\nupon the nude bodies of his goddesses unsurpassed by previous art. The\nbeauty of it all was not to last much longer.\n\nLenormant de Tournehem died suddenly in the November of 1751; the\nPompadour's brother, Abel Poisson de Vandi\u00e8res, was appointed\nDirector-General in his stead at the age of twenty-five--and soon\nafterwards, on the death of his father, created Marquis de Marigny--a\nshy, handsome youth, a gentleman and an honourable fellow, whom the\nking liked well, and against whom his sister's sole complaint was that\nhe lacked the brazen effrontery of the courtiers of the day. No man\ndid more for the advancement of the art of his time. A pension of a\nthousand livres falling vacant, the young fellow secured it for\nBoucher; and almost immediately afterwards, a studio becoming vacant\nat the Louvre owing to the death of Coypel, first painter to the king,\nBoucher came to his coveted home, eagerly moving in with his family as\nsoon as its wretched state could be put into repair.\n\nThe decoration of the new wing to the palace at Fontainebleau brought\nthe commission for the painting of the ceiling and the principal\npicture in the Council Chamber to Boucher, who had already decorated\nthe Dining-Room. This was the period of his painting the \"Rising\" and\nthe \"Setting of the Sun\" for the Pompadour, now in the Watteau\ncollection, two canvases that were always favourites with the painter,\nbitterly as they were assailed by the critic Grimm.\n\nHe was turning out so much work that it was impossible to give as much\ncare to his pictures as he ought. For he refused sternly, his life\nlong, to raise his prices; by consequence he had to create a larger\namount of work in order to meet his expenditure. It was about this\ntime that Reynolds, passing through Paris, went to visit him and found\nhim painting on a huge canvas without models or sketches. \"On\nexpressing my surprise,\" writes Reynolds, \"he replied that he had\nconsidered the model as necessary during his youth until he had\ncompleted his study of art, but that he had not used one for a long\ntime past.\"\n\nHe soon had not the time, not only to paint from nature but even to\ngive his pictures the work necessary to complete them. The feverish\nhaste which took possession of him in his frantic endeavour to meet\nthe vast demand for his pictures, and the eager efforts of his\nengravers to satisfy the public call for engravings after his works,\ngave him less and less leisure to joy in their doing. And his eyesight\nbegan to fail. His flesh-tints deepened to a reddish hue; and he\nstands baffled before his work, suspecting his sight, since what every\none cries out upon as being bright vermilion, he only sees as a dull\nearthy colour. Boucher has topped the height of his achievement; he\nhas to \"descend the other side of the hill.\" Boucher begins to grow\nold.\n\nIn Boucher's fifty-first year an ugly intrigue of the queen's party at\nCourt to sap the Pompadour's influence over the king by drawing away\nthe king's affections towards Madame de Choiseul-Romanet, a reckless\nyoung beauty of the Court, brought about a strange alliance. The Count\nde Stainville, one of the Pompadour's bitterest enemies, was shown the\nking's letter of invitation to his young kinswoman; and he, deeply\nwounded in his pride that his kinswoman should have been offered to\nthe king, went to the Pompadour and exposed the plot. A close\nalliance followed; and De Stainville thenceforth became her chief\nguide in affairs of state. It was at her instance that the king called\nhim to be his Prime Minister, raising him to the Duchy of Choiseul--a\nname he made illustrious as one of the greatest Ministers of France.\n\nIn his fifty-second year Boucher was appointed to the directorship of\nthe Gobelins looms, to the huge delight of the weavers and all\nconcerned with the tapestry factory. This was the year of his painting\nthe famous portrait of the Pompadour, to whom he several times paid\nthis \"tribute of immorality.\" For the Gobelins looms he produced many\nhandsome designs; and he was painting with astounding industry. But\nhis hand's skill began to falter. His art shows weariness in his\nsixtieth year, and sickness fell upon him, and held him in servitude\nnow with rare moments of respite. The critics, notoriously Diderot,\nwere now attacking him with shameless virulence. Boucher passed it all\nby; but he felt the change that was taking place in the public taste.\n\nThe ideas of the New Philosophy were infecting public opinion; the Man\nof Feeling had arisen in the land; and France, humiliated in war, and\nresenting the follies and the greed of her shameless privileged class,\nwas openly resenting it and all its works. Choiseul had planted his\nstrength deep in the people's party, and was come near to being its\ngod. His masterly mind had checked Frederick of Prussia to the North;\nand the nations, exhausted by the struggle, signed the Peace of Paris\nin 1763. Choiseul, with France at peace abroad, turned to the blotting\nout of the turbulent order of the Jesuits at home. Their attempt to\nend the Pompadour's relations with the king made this powerful woman\neager to complete his design; the chance was soon to come, and the\nOrder was abolished from France and its vast property seized by the\nstate.\n\nThe Pompadour lived but a short while to enjoy her triumph. Worn out\nby her superhuman activities, assailed by debt, she fell ill of a\nracking cough, dying on the 15th of April, 1764, in her forty-second\nyear, keeping her ascendancy over the king and the supreme power in\nFrance to her last hour. Death found her transacting affairs of state.\n\nLouis, weary of his servitude, had only a heartless epigram to cast\nat the body of the dead woman as she passed to her last resting-place.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE END\n\n\nThe death of the Pompadour robbed Boucher of a friend; but her\nbrother, Marigny, remained faithfully attached to the old artist, and\nseized every chance to honour him. On the death of Carle van Loo,\nBoucher, at sixty-two, was made first painter to the king, with all\nhis pensions and privileges that were consistent with this the supreme\nappointment in the art world.\n\nThere had been serious intention of making Boucher the head of the\nEcole des El\u00e8ves Proteg\u00e9s; he had the art of making himself liked and\nof inspiring the love of the arts. He was very popular with the\nstudents and artists, owing to his kindliness, his eagerness to render\nservice, his readiness to encourage the youngsters or to console them.\n\nWhen the riot took place, provoked by the Academicians by their award\nof the Prix de Rome in 1767, the students insulted the Academicians,\nbut hailed Boucher with enthusiastic applause. The reason was not far\nto seek. When a student came to the old master for advice he did not\n\"play the pontiff,\" and, scorning the false dignity of big phrases, he\ntook the brush in his hand and showed the way out of all difficulties\nby simplehearted example, despising rules, and putting himself out in\norder to make things clear to a young artist.\n\nHowever, the Academicians feared he would be an unorthodox master for\nyouth, and appointed another in his place.\n\nA long and serious illness thwarted his keen energies. Diderot was\ngiving himself up to outrageous violence against him. If the old\npainter exhibited at the Salon, Diderot fiercely assailed his art; if\nhe did not exhibit, Diderot as bitterly assailed him for his\nnegligences. Above all, he attacked Boucher in that he did not paint\nwhat Diderot would have painted--but could not. \"When he paints\ninfants,\" cries Diderot, \"you will not find one employed in a real act\nof life--studying his lesson, reading, writing, stripping hemp.\"\n\nPoor unfortunate infants! for whom Philosophy could find no happier\njoy in life than stripping hemp! Boucher was but an artist. He\npainted his generation as far as he could see it, and, with all his\nfaults and weaknesses, he never debauched his art with foreign and\nalien things that had no part in the nation's life; he painted fair\nFrance into his landscapes, not a make-believe land he did not know\nwith preposterous Greek ruins; and best of all, to his eternal honour,\nhe painted infants glad in their gladness to be alive, with no desire\nto send their happy little bodies to school, with no sickly ambition\nto make them into budding philosophers, with no thought of making them\npose and lie as Men of Feeling. He had no joy in setting their little\nbodies to toil--in making them \"teach a lesson to the spectator,\" in\nmaking them stoop their little shoulders to the \"picking of hemp.\"\n\nHe continued to paint as he had always painted--except that he painted\nless well. The wreath of roses was wilting on a grey head. The blood\njigged less warmly in the frail body. The features showed pallid--the\neyes haggard. The sight failed. The hand alone kept something of its\ncunning.\n\nHe went to Holland with his friend Randon du Boisset, but health\nshrank farther from him. Diderot had near spent his last jibe.\n\nIn 1768, Boucher's sixty-fifth year, the neglected queen went to her\ngrave. The king's grief and contrition and vows to amend his life came\ntoo late, and lasted little longer than the drying of the floods of\ntears over the body of his dead consort. A year later he was become\nthe creature of a pretty woman of the gutters, whom he caused to be\nmarried to the Count du Barry--the infamously famous Madame du Barry.\n\nBut neither the remonstrances of Choiseul with the king against this\nfurther degradation of the throne of France, nor his unconcealed scorn\nof the upstart countess, nor the dangerous enemy he made for himself\nthereby, signified now to Boucher, first painter to the king.\n\nBoucher was failing. His son was a prig and a disappointment. His two\nfavourite pupils, Baudoin and Deshayes, who had married his two girls,\ndied.\n\nTo the Salon of 1769 he sent his \"Caravan of Bohemians.\" It was his\nlast display. He had been going about for some time like a gaunt ghost\nof his former self, afflicted with all the ills inevitable to a life\nfeverishly consumed in work and the pursuit of pleasure.\n\nThey went to his studio at five of the clock one May morning, and\nfound him seated at his easel, before a canvas of Venus, dead, with\nthe paint-filled brush fallen out of his fingers.\n\nSo passed he away on the 30th of May 1770, in his sixty-seventh year.\n\nWhen Boucher died, the generation of which he was the limner was near\ncome to its violent end. The rosy carnivals and gay gallantries of his\nage gave way to the blood-stained romance and fierce tempest of the\nRevolution. The garrets of the old curiosity-shops received the\ndiscarded canvases of the master. His shepherds and shepherdesses were\nput to rout by the Romans of his pupil, citizen David. The old order\nwas brought into contempt and overthrown. And with it, Boucher's art,\nlike much that was gracious and charming and good in the evil thing,\nwent down also, and was overwhelmed for a while.\n\nFor a while only. For just as, out of the blood and terror of the\nRevolution, a real France arose, phnix-wise, from the ruin, and in\nbeing born, whilst putting off the vilenesses of the thing from which\nshe sprang, took on also to herself the gracious and winsome qualities\nthat place her amongst the most fascinating peoples of the ages; so\nBoucher has come into his kingdom again--the most gracious of painters\nthat the years have yielded."

                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n        a. One bed, or folding cot,\n        b. One oil stove,\n        c. One lamp,\n        d. Enough supplies of all kinds sufficient for six months,\n        e. Pots, pans, kettles, etc.\nIt is needless to say that positions in Manila and Iloilo were now at\na premium.\n\nWas it possible that teachers were to be sent to places where even the\nnecessaries of life could not be obtained! Was it possible that many\nwould be sent to places so remote that for six months no fresh\nsupplies could be gotten! A mass meeting was held at once, and a\ncommittee was appointed to send a cablegram to the Associated Press\npetitioning aid from the American people at large. Realizing what\nconsternation would be created throughout the United States by such a\nmessage, two of the teachers leaped into a carriage at the close of\nthe meeting and a few moments later were closeted with the chief\nexecutive of the department. As a result the committee was persuaded\nnot to send the cablegram to the Associated Press until by courtesy it\nhad been sent to the President. Of course, this diplomatic move tided\naffairs over and the teachers who had flatly refused to budge from\nManila now agreed to go on to their stations, being assured that\nwhatever action was best would be taken.\n\nThe day had come when we must separate. We were to enter an untried\nand an unknown field. It was fitting that we have a final joyous\nmeeting, so the best orchestra in the archipelago was engaged and we\n\"chased the hours with flying feet\" until dawn so that whatever might\ncome to us in that unknown future upon which we were entering each\nwould hold in pleasant memory our last evening together.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER III. - A DRAMA IN ACTUAL LIFE.\n\n\nAlmost every one heeded the warning to go to his station forearmed\nwith at least necessaries of life, but, as it had never fallen to the\nlot of the writer to cook, he refused to learn at that late day, so he\ntook no pot, no pan, no kettle, putting his future into the hands of\nan uncertain fate and relying upon the unknown hospitality of the\nFilipino.\n\nBacalod, the capital of the province of Occidental Negros, was our\ndestination. The second morning after leaving Manila, we awoke with\nthe \"Kilpatrick\" lying at anchor in a shallow bay. We were several\nmiles from the shore and nothing in sight indicated that we had\nreached a place of any importance. Late the night before we had been\nawakened by the loud, sharp ringing of the ship's bells, accompanied\nby the reversal of the engines and a general disturbance awaking the\ncrew. So our first impressions on coming on deck were that we had run\naground. But the captain assured us that everything was ship-shape and\nthat this was the nearest point of approach to Capiz, a town of\nconsiderable importance on the island of Panay, where a body of troops\nwas to embark for home. Not even the grass hut of a native was in\nsight. Search as we would, not a sign was seen of a stream flowing\ninto the sea, indicating the probable presence of a town. There was\nnot a sign of life of any kind save one lone column of thin, blue\nsmoke that arose from the side of a mountain miles away. One would\nhave thought that we were explorers of three hundred years ago lying\noff the shore of some unknown land.\n\nAfter breakfast the steam launch, together with all the boats, was\nlowered, and several of us who had determined to miss no opportunity\nto gather information about the islands took our places in the launch\nby the side of the ship's mate, and steamed away across the water with\na long line of boats strung out in the rear. We headed away toward a\ngroup of cocoanut trees, and about an hour later stepped ashore on a\npile of decayed coral rocks that extended some twenty or thirty feet\nout into the water, thus forming the only landing place of a town of\nseveral thousands of people and of considerable commercial importance.\n\nA few moments after we had landed, an army wagon drawn by a\nmagnificent pair of mules came up out of a tropical jungle along a\nnarrow road. We clambered into the wagon and were soon lost in the\ndepths of foliage from which we had just seen the vehicle emerge.\n\nLong waving bamboos with their plumy leafage hung over the road from\neach side, meeting and overlapping in the center until they formed an\narchway so dense that the tropical sun now high in the heavens\npenetrated it only at intervals. At times the wagon sank up to the\nhubs in the soft earth, and the muscles of the mules stood out like\nwhip-cords under the skin as they drew us forward.\n\nAt a sharp turn in the road we came upon the first division of troops\nthat was to embark for home. The look of joy upon their sun-browned\nfaces was inexpressible. Their work was done, and with elastic step\nand smiling faces they saluted us as they passed by. The reign of\nforce was at an end; it was going out with them; the reign of peace\nhad begun; it was coming in with us.\n\nIn the afternoon when we returned from the town the last of the troops\nhad arrived and, as we drove up, the bugle was sounding the call to\nsupper. We noticed native women mingling with the troops and, indeed,\na native woman was in constant attention waiting upon one of the\nsoldiers with whom we ate. Her clothes were clean, her hair was nicely\ncombed, and her general appearance was neat. She seemed to anticipate\nthe slightest wish of the soldier with whom she was. She brought him\nwater to drink, cleaned his plate after the meal and saw that his\nknife, fork, and spoon were put into his haversack.\n\nWe had now finished supper and the launch had returned for the last\nload of troops. The lieutenant in command of the company gave the\norder to \"fall in\"; the men shouldered their rifles and fell into\nline. \"Forward, march!\" called the lieutenant, and the column swept\nforward towards the boats. The women had until now restrained\nthemselves, but, as their husbands marched away never to return, their\nfeelings could no longer be restrained. One young woman of about\neighteen, who was leaning against a rock by the roadside sobbing, when\nher husband passed, leaped up in frenzy of passionate love and caught\nthe rifle from his shoulder. Her first impulse seemed to be to throw\nthe gun away, but suddenly realizing the futility of such an act she\nburst into tears, shouldered the rifle herself and marched on by his\nside. Another woman of more mature age threw her arms around the legs\nof a tall stalwart man, and drew him bodily from the line.\n\nBut the troops marched on and entered the boats. One woman who had\nbeen unnoticed before came down into the shallow water and caught hold\nof our last boat as if to prevent its leaving, while others stood\nmingling their sobs with the sounds of the wavelets as they broke on\nthe sands. As we passed away, an expectant mother, standing in bold\noutline against the twilight sky, threw up her hands in an agony of\ndespair and then sank upon the stones. The curtain had fallen upon a\ndrama in actual life deeper in pathos than any other we had ever seen\nor ever expected to see. Depth of passion, depth of love! Who can\nfathom the human heart?\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. - WHAT THE TEACHERS DID.\n\n\nThere is a remarkable sameness about the towns in the Philippines.\n\nThey all have a large open square about the middle of the town, around\nthree sides of which are Chinese stores, unless one side lies open to\nthe sea, and on the fourth is the great stone ecclesia. The streets\nrun at right angles to one another and divide up the town into\ncreditable squares.\n\nEverybody in the Philippines lives up-stairs, for the ground is so\nsoaked with water during the rainy season that it is a menace to\nhealth to live upon the ground floor. So even the poorest nippa hut\nis built upon stakes four or five feet above the ground.\n\nBacalod is a typical Philippine town. As we landed, a broad open\nsquare was spread out before us. Two sides of the square were lined\nwith two-story houses in which were Chinese stores below and Filipino\nhomes above. On the third side stood the great stone church in whose\nmassive tower the clock was striking the hour of four, while the\nfourth lay open to the sea that had borne us thither.\n\nWe landed, but it was in a method new to us and one not usually\nemployed by the traveling public.\n\nWhen our sail boat ran aground on the sandy bottom a hundred yards or\nmore from the shore, a crowd of Filipino men who were on the beach\nslowly rolled up their pantaloons and waded out to the rescue,--for\nthe money that was in it. The boat's crew elevated their trousers'\nlegs also and slided down into the water. Each of us then straddled\nthe neck of a Filipino standing in the water and was held by ankles to\nbe steadied while our biped mounts proceeded to the shore.\n\nWe were now on the ground and face to face with the situation. To give\nthe reader an idea of the actual conditions met by the first teachers\nwho went to the Islands, the following is copied from the instructions\ngiven us in Manila:\n    1. There shall be two sessions daily of all schools, and the\n    last hour of the morning session shall be devoted solely to\n    instructing the Filipino teachers.\n\n    2. In cases where teachers are sent to a town in which there\n    is no school-house, they are expected to secure the aid of the\n    people and have one built.\n\n    3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is\n    stopped.\n\n    4. All supplies must be kept under lock and key. In towns\n    where there is no case or box to lock the supplies in, and it\n    is also impossible to get the town council to furnish a case,\n    a requisition may be sent to Manila, and, if an appropriation\n    can be secured, one will be made and sent out.\n\nThus it can be easily seen that we were indeed pioneers. In many\nplaces no school-house was to be found, and in some cases it was even\ndifficult to get the town council to provide a case in which to keep\nthe supplies.\n\nThe work of the teachers was, in short; to \"make the English language\nthe basis of instruction in the public schools.\" On our arrival at\nBacalod two schools were found in progress, for some soldiers had been\ndetailed for the work here previous to our coming. One of these was\nfor boys and the other, for girls. Thus the work here had been in a\nmeasure simplified, but complications that had arisen at Talisay, one\nof the largest and richest towns on the island, demanded a change of\nteachers and the writer was assigned to the place as superintendent.\n\nHere an attempt had been made to start a school but it had failed\nignominiously and a system of education was to be put into operation\nfrom the very start.\n\nThe Filipinos are not strong advocates of co-education, so separate\nschools were to be started for the boys and the girls. The one for the\nboys was gotten well in hand before the one for the girls was\nattempted at all.\n\nA few days after reaching the town and securing a home the\npresidente of the town had it publicly announced that the following\nMonday morning at eight o'clock a public school for boys would be\nopened in a building that had been rented for the purpose by the\nmunicipal council. About the middle of the afternoon of the same day a\nman beat a little drum throughout all the streets of the town to call\nthe people out and the town clerk announced both in Spanish and in the\nnative language that this public school would begin at the time and\nplace mentioned above; that instruction would be free to all who came;\nthat the government would furnish all supplies; and that instruction\nwould be given in the English language. A native principal and\nassistants were employed and everything was ready to begin.\n\nThe official report of the result is as follows:\n    Boys' public school of Talisay, Negros, P. I., began November\n    4, 1901. Forty-three boys present at eight o'clock. Forty-one\n    of them knew \"good morning\" and \"good afternoon\" but do not\n    know the distinction between them. Two of them speak simple\n    Spanish. At eight forty-five, eight more, who had been\n    attending an early morning private school, came in together.\n\n    The books they brought were so varied and so different from\n    one another that it seemed impossible to bring any reasonable\n    degree of order out of such a chaos, and so, after struggling\n    vainly for about a week with the problem, the superintendent\n    by one fell stroke removed everything in use and put in a\n    uniform system, and from that day on the English language has\n    been the basis of instruction in the public schools of\n    Talisay. The work was of necessity very slow at first, but by\n    the end of a year two schools were going nicely and a number\n    of the brightest boys and girls had made really excellent\n    progress.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER V. - A \"BAILE.\"\n\n\nNot long after the arrival of our party at Bacalod we received an\ninvitation to a \"baile\" given in our honor by the inhabitants of\nSilay, a town some ten or twelve miles up the northern coast and one\nnoted for its social life. The invitation was accepted with pleasure,\nand about the middle of the afternoon on the day appointed we were\nclad in the immaculate white of the tropics and steaming away up the\ncoast on board a launch sent for our conveyance. Twilight was still\nlingering on the path of day when we anchored just off shore at the\ntown. A row-boat containing the officials of the city came out to meet\nus and, in due season, we were ushered into a spacious drawing-room\nfilled almost to overflowing with the \u00e9lite of the town. The \u00e9lite of\ntowns in the Philippines speak Spanish, and, as only one or two of our\nparty could at that time boast of more than a formal acquaintance with\nthe Castilian tongue, the exchange of ideas that evening between us\nand the Filipinos was of necessity not very rapid.\n\nThe necessity of easy communication between us was rendered somewhat\nless indispensable by the announcement of supper as soon as we were\nrested from our trip. When we had taken our places at the table a\nyoung Filipino about twenty-five years of age arose and gave a lengthy\ntoast to the recent union of the Philippines with the United States.\n\nBut as we Americans were unable to scale the dizzy heights of his\nclimaxes or sink to the depths of his pathos, we forewent the\npleasures of his oratory and turned our attention to the savory odor\nof lamb, chicken, and roast pig that came slyly stealing up our\nnostrils to send us nerve dispatches about the gastronomic delights of\nour not far distant future.\n\nAt last the toast was ended and the world-wide soup ushered in a long\ntrain of things good to eat, served in a style better fitted to the\ndelights of the appetite than to the formalities of dinners, for, as\nsoon as the pleasant task of one dish was completed by any one, the\nnext was served him at once regardless of the progress made by the\nothers at the table.\n\nThe last course was dulce. The new-comers to the Philippines will\nnot be long in making the acquaintance of this dish, and at all\nmeetings, both public and private, where eatables are served, it\nperforms an important part. It is anything sweet, and it may vary all\nthe way from an india-rubber-like black mixture of cocoanut milk and\ndirty sugar to a really toothsome and respectable confection. No\nmatter of what materials a dish is composed, just so long as it is\nsweet, it is dulce.\n\nAfter paying our respects to this last course, we arose from the table\nand entered a great rectangular room from the center of whose ceiling\nhung a large glass chandelier, a mass of shimmering crystals. In the\nchairs around the room were the wealth, the youth, and the beauty of\nthe town.\n\nThe first and also the last number of every Filipino dance of any\nformality is the \"rigodon.\" The dancers are arranged in a square, or\nquadrangle according to the number participating, and are then led\nthrough a tangled maze of figures that so utterly bewilders the novice\nthat he sinks into his chair at the end of the dance wondering how it\nall came to pass.\n\nWe Americans breathed a sigh of relief when the \"rigodon\" ended, and\nmustered fresh courage for social conquests in the waltz that was now\nbreathing forth from the trembling strings. My companion in the first\ndance had been the young lady by whose side I had sat at dinner. But\nit now became necessary to search for another, so I prudently waited\nto see how partners were chosen, and made no mistake when a few\nmoments later I faced one of the most luscious looking se\u00f1oritas on\nthe opposite side of the room and offered her my arm. My eyes must\nhave told the story that my lips could not utter in Spanish, for she\nsmiled upon me sweetly, arose, and put her hand upon my shoulder. My\narm encircled her waist and I began to waltz. Unfortunately my\ncompanion did not follow, but began to hop up and down in a manner\nmost distressing. Supposing the attack to be only temporary, I paused\nand, much to my relief, she soon showed signs of recovery; and in the\ncourse of time she came to a standstill looking up into my face in an\ninquiring sort of way, apparently wondering why St. Vitus had not paid\nhis respects to me also. A second attempt to follow the music met with\nresults similar to the first, and during the third attempt, which\nseemed to be trembling on the verge of a failure, St. Vitus let go my\ncompanion and seized me with such vigor that she, who was small even\nfor a Filipino, was gathered up bodily and taken around the room at\nsuch a pace that her toes touched the floor only at far distant\nintervals.\n\nAt this point my devotion to the shrine of Terpsichore ceased from\nforce of circumstances and I seated myself in one of the most\ncomfortable chairs in sight that I might carry out a previously formed\nplan to study the Filipino somewhat critically as he appears in\nsociety.\n\nThe first thing that impressed me as the dancers passed up and down\nthe room was the flash of diamonds. Nearly every woman in the room had\non a brooch that flashed the colors of the rainbow at every turn.\n\nAlmost all of them wore one or more rings that showed up brilliantly\nunder the chandelier. Many of the men too, especially the young men,\nwore gems that appeared to be exquisite. A closer inspection showed\nthat some of the gems had flaws and others were of a poor color, but\nno one would have denied that, taken as a whole, it was a really\nbeautiful display.\n\nThe dress of the ladies was richly colored. Many of their skirts were\nof silk covered with hand embroidered flowers, and their filmy pina\nwaists and broad collar pieces were rich with needle-work. They all\nwore a kind of heelless velvet slipper, very common as a dress shoe in\nthe Philippines, or high-heeled patent leather shoes with neatly\nfitting black stockings.\n\nThe men were dressed in white coats and white pantaloons or black\ncoats and white pantaloons. White shirts and collars, together with\nall sorts and styles of cravats and low-cut patent leather shoes with\nhighly colored socks completed their dress.\n\nIt was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money;\nthat they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a\ntable loaded with good things was a fact to which all of us were\nenthusiastic witnesses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VI. - A SKETCH OF LIFE IN THE PHILIPPINES.\n\n\nHouse-keeping in the Philippines presents some interesting phases. Our\nclub of American officials decided to run a mess, so we employed a\ncook and a house boy, then each of us provided himself with a personal\nservant, making a total of six servants for four men--it takes about\nthis proportion of servants to live in any sort of comfort in the\nPhilippines--and launched ourselves boldly upon the sea of domestic\neconomy. But there were shoals ahead of us, for the question of\nregulating servants is one of no small importance in the Philippines,\nand one of its most disadvantageous features is the long chain of\ndependents that usually attends it.\n\nWe gave the cooks so much a day with which to buy supplies in the\nlocal market, for our own table, making him render a daily list of\nexpenditures, and a fixed amount besides to purchase rice and fish for\nhimself and the other servants. Of course, if they wished to vary\ntheir diet and get chicken and fresh pork, which could be had at far\ndistant intervals, it was wholly a matter of their option, but the\nallowance was made on the basis of so much rice and fish a day for\neach. This allowance was about fifteen cents a day in Spanish coin per\nservant.\n\nThus far all was well. We had agreed to give the cook eight dollars a\nmonth in Spanish money, thinking that good wages would procure good\nservice, but the visions of affluence that floated before him on such\nfloods of wealth were so alluring that they drew him from the kitchen\nto the cooler veranda. In less than a week he had employed an\nassistant at four dollars a month; in less than another week that\nassistant had employed him an assistant at two dollars a month; in\nless than another week that assistant to the assistant had employed\nhim an assistant at the princely salary of fifty cents a month; and\nfrom fear that the chain of dependents would end only by our having\nthe whole Filipino race attached to our culinary force, we broke up\nhouse-keeping and went boarding again, choosing that as the less of\nthe two evils.\n\nOur house furnishings were almost wholly Philippine. The table ware\nand the food on the table came from the ends of the earth. The knives\nand forks were made in Germany, the plates were manufactured in\nEngland, the glass ware and table cloth, in the United States. The\noatmeal and flour came from the United States also. The butter came\nfrom Australia, the rice from China, the salt from Russia, and the\nother eatables from sources about as various as their separate names.\n\nSwitzerland furnished the condensed milk and Illinois the canned\ncream. Nearly all of the canned fruit bore labels from Spain.\n\nThus it can easily be seen that life in the Philippines, if lived\naccording to American ideals, is dependent upon a highly developed and\nhighly complex commerce. However, the difficulties of transportation\nand the restriction of large stocks of merchandise to Manila and some\nhalf a dozen other towns, make so great a difference between country\nlife and city life that a short comparison of the two will not be out\nof place, and life in Manila may well be taken as being fairly typical\nof the latter.\n\nLife in Manila is pleasant, but expensive. It is pleasant from the\nfact that it is not only the capital but also metropolis of the\narchipelago. Thus the combination of wealth and high official position\nhas given to Manila a society of the highest and most refined type.\n\nThe process of beautifying and improving the city which is constantly\ngoing on bids fair to give us at no distant day a city of which we may\nwell be proud.\n\nBut let him who intends living well in Manila on a small income bid\nfarewell at once to so idylic a dream, for it costs much to live well\nthere. In the city of Manila one can get almost anything he wishes,\nbut it must be paid for at the price it commands. Especially in the\ncase of eatables, this price is by no means small, because to the\nfirst cost of articles must in most cases be added the expense of\ndistant shipment from American, European, or Australian ports, and not\ninfrequently the cost of long refrigeration must also be taken into\nconsideration. But, expensive though it is, it is very pleasant to\nlive there and those who have once enjoyed it often wish again to\nquaff the cup of its delights.\n\nIn strong contrast to this pleasant life is the life of the quiet\nlittle hamlet away in the distant islands. Indeed, the Filipino from\nthe distant town, who by some good fortune has been to Manila, or, by\na coup de main, has studied in one of the Manila colleges, is looked\nup to in a true hero-worshiping attitude by all who either know him or\nhear of his fame. Life in such a place is one long state of harmless\ninactivity. Not a wave of trouble from the great outer world ever\ndisturbs its peaceful repose. One lounges forever in an air of\nindolent ease and extreme aversion to anything approaching what might\nbe called a respectable effort.\n\nOne arises in the morning about the time the sun's first rays silver\nthe top leaves of the cocoanut trees and then stirs around until nine\nor ten o'clock, when it is found expedient to avoid a further exposure\nto the sun. From then until about five o'clock in the afternoon it is\nbest to take things as they come, even though one of those things be a\nFilipino dinner. But then you may have your vehiclo attached to a\nyoung bull with a ring in his nose and go for a drive. If it is the\ndry season you will probably enjoy the drive unless you object to the\nfrequent clouds of dust swept along by the evening wind. If it is in\nthe rainy season your pleasure will depend to a considerable extent\nupon how wet you get; but, whether the season be wet or dry, your\npleasure will be regulated largely by the state of harmony existing\nbetween the driver and the bull.\n\nIn these quiet secluded nooks successive generations of Filipinos are\nborn, reared, grow old and die in an even chain of events broken only\nby the occasional erection of a new grass house on the identical spot\nwhere its predecessors have stood for ages. The son lives in the house\nof his father, cultivates the same few square feet of soil planted in\nedible roots, climbs the same cocoanut trees, follows the same winding\npath down to the stream, pounds rice in the same mortar and with the\nsame stick that his ancestors have used from time unremembered, and,\nin case of illness, curls up on a grass mat in a corner of the room\nuntil he dies or by some good fortune recovers. Beyond this narrow\nhorizon he never looks. So narrow and contracted is the life that the\nlanguages of two towns a few miles apart are so different that one\nwould scarcely recognize them as belonging to the same race of people.\n\nSuch are the two extremes of life in our new far Eastern provinces:\nthe one is active, progressive, and cosmopolitan; the other, inactive,\ndecadent, and narrow; but, whether one enjoys the first or endures the\nsecond, there comes to him after leaving a longing to lounge again in\ntropic airs and listen to the lullaby of the winds among the palms.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VII. - THE FILIPINO AT HOME.\n\n\nAs one enters a Filipino sitting-room for the first time, there is one\nfeature in the arrangement of the furniture that impresses itself upon\nhim at once, and it may be stated without fear of serious\ncontradiction that this same peculiar feature in its arrangement will\ncontinue to face him, as he enters different homes, about as certainly\nas he crosses the threshold.\n\nThe arrangement referred to is that of one large mirror, one settee,\nand some ten or a dozen chairs that appear to have had a certain\norderly affection for one another. The mirror is hung upon one of the\nlarge interior parts of the house about four feet above the floor. The\nwooden houses in the Philippines are built by setting large posts\nupright into the ground, extending into the air from twenty to thirty\nfeet. Cross timbers are fastened to these upright posts about eight or\nten feet above the ground and then not sawed off even with the posts,\nbut allowed to extend beyond them each way. The framework of the house\nis built upon these extending cross timbers, a style of building by\nwhich these large upright posts are left standing out on the inside of\nthe room from one to three feet from the walls. It is on that one of\nthese posts most nearly opposite the door that the mirror always finds\nits place. Immediately beneath the mirror is the settee; and the\nchairs are arranged in two parallel lines facing one another and at\nright angles with the ends of the settee. However odd this arrangement\nmay appear to one when he first enters a Filipino drawing-room, there\nare two things to be said in its favor. In the first place, it places\nyou face to face with the person with whom you are conversing so that\nyou can watch him,--a matter of no small moment in the Philippines. In\nthe next place, it enables you to give one of the young ladies a\nsheep's-eye in the mirror while the others present are left where\nMoses was in our much abused conundrum.\n\nThe size of the residence and the quality of its furnishings depends\nupon the wealth of the owner. But there is so vast a difference\nbetween the mode of life of the highest class and the tao, or lowest\nclass, that it is well to speak of them separately, and the great\nmiddle class of Filipinos can easily be imagined to occupy the\nintervening ground.\n\nThe rich Filipino's house is usually of wood built upon a wall of\nstone or brick from ten to fifteen feet high. The floors are kept\nhighly polished in his hallway, dressing-room, and bed-rooms. There\nare, of course, no fire-places in any of the rooms, but on some\noccasions something is needed to dry the rain-soaked atmosphere, for\neven in the dry season it has been seen to rain for five successive\ndays and nights without the cessation of a moment.\n\nA long chain of dependents is attached to the household of the rich\nFilipino. The master has his special body servant to be present at all\ntimes to do his master's bidding, in short, to be the visible\nmechanism of his master's volition. So, too, the lady of the house has\nher servant woman to do the slightest bidding of her ladyship. Then\nthere is the cook who is almost invariably a man, a house boy or two,\nand the coachman. These functionaries, with their assistants and\nassistants to the assistants, together with a servant or two for the\nexclusive service of the children, complete the economic household.\n\nSuch a family has an abundance of rice and wheat bread, also of\nchicken and fish with occasional fresh beef. They have also a good\ndeal of dulce. They regularly serve wine and frequently serve beer\non their tables.\n\nIn strong contrast with this mode of life is that of the tao. His\ndiet consists almost wholly of rice and small uncleaned fish boiled\ntogether. As a rule knife, fork, plate, and spoon find no place in his\nhousehold. The rice and fish are boiled in a pot and then allowed to\ncool in the same vessel or poured out to cool in a large earthen or\nwooden bowl. Then Mr. Tao together with Mrs. Tao and all the young\nTaos squat on their heels around the mixture and satisfy that\nintangible thing called the appetite. They do not use chop sticks as\nthe Chinese do, but the rice and fish are caught in a hollow formed by\nthe first three fingers of the right hand. The thumb is then placed\nbehind the mass. It is raised up and poised before the mouth, with a\nskill coming from the evolution of ages, when a contraction of the\nmuscles of the thumb throws the mass into the mouth with a skill that\nis marvelous to any but a Filipino. To judge from the most reliable\ninformation, the poorest class do not have an abundance of food,\nalthough it would seem that such a condition of things would be\nwell-nigh impossible. However, in a census of one hundred school\nchildren there were found six boys and four girls who declared that\nthey had never had enough to eat, and the native teacher stated that\nthis was probably true.\n\nThe wide gulf between the tao and the rich man is filled by the\ngreat middle class of Filipinos.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VIII. - VISIT TO A LEPER COLONY.\n\n\nNot far from our town was a leper colony and the first Saturday that\ncould be spared was set aside for a trip to the place. It happened\nthat none of the other Americans were at leisure on this particular\nmorning, but, rather then delay the trip or miss it altogether, the\nwriter, armed with a revolver, started out alone.\n\nThe road had been described so accurately by one who was supposed to\nknow it that it was deemed well-nigh impossible to miss the way. The\nmain highway was followed to the point where the by-path supposed to\nlead to the settlement turned off through some bamboo thickets and a\nlow tropical wood. This path led straight away towards the sea-coast\nwhere the houses of the colony were said to stand in a cocoanut grove\nby the beach.\n\nUpon arriving at the settlement, a very inhospitable reception was\nreceived from a mangy cur that growled and showed a very uninviting\nset of sharp, white teeth behind his snarling lips. The growling of\nthe dog had attracted the attention of an old man who, with age-bent\nback, was pounding rice in a mortar about fifty yards away. He turned\nslowly around and, upon seeing an intruder into the primitive quiet of\nthe place, gave a sharp, far-reaching call. The sound had scarcely\nrung through the grove when from about a dozen of the little grass\nhouses dotted here and there fifteen or twenty men armed with bolos\ncame out and gathered around the old man. A sense of my danger flashed\nupon me. Three miles from town and alone in a tropical jungle, I could\nbe almost instantly overcome by this band of bolo-men, and the only\nreport that would ever reach my people would be that I had\n\"disappeared.\" Of course, attack was by no means certain, but the\npotentiality of the situation was thrilling. A drawn revolver and the\ngleaming of its shining barrel had the effect of stopping the men, who\nseemed to be hesitating as to a course of action, until a somewhat\ndignified retreat was made to an open space in the rear from where a\nless dignified and a more hasty retreat began which did not stop short\nof Bacalod.\n\nEnough had been seen, however, even in this short visit, to give\nconvincing proof that the settlement visited was no colony of lepers;\nso, that afternoon two servant boys being taken as guides and\ninterpreters, another attempt was made to reach the goal desired.\n\nThis attempt was successful, and, after about two hours of walking, a\nlittle cluster of grass huts snugly hidden by the sea-coast came into\nview. As we approached, one would have thought it a gala-day. Some few\nchildren, apparently from six to thirteen years of age, almost wholly\nnude, were romping and playing in the open space around which the huts\nstood, and no one would ever have thought that any cloud so horrible\nas leprosy could hover over a place apparently so happy.\n\nBy the side of the path as we passed was a man and his wife setting\nout potato plants. His hands were so puffed and his fingers so short\nthat he could scarcely use them, but he was working along as best he\ncould. His wife's feet were so swollen and twisted that she walked\nonly with the greatest difficulty. We passed them by and entered the\nopen space above referred to.\n\nThe children now saw us, and those of them who could darted away like\nfrightened rabbits, each to his own burrow. An old man who was sitting\nin the warm afternoon sun on the little bamboo platform before his hut\nwas aroused from his lethargic repose by the scampering away of the\nchildren. He arose, trembling upon his tottering limbs, all drawn and\ntwisted, and hobbled away into his hut.\n\nThe children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at\nthe doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of\nthe settlement. In a few moments we were surrounded by a circle of\nhuman beings at once so repulsive and so pitiable that its graphic\nvividness can never be accurately portrayed.\n\nThe old man referred to above, having put on a pair of snow-white\npantaloons, appeared now at the doorway of his hut, followed a few\nmoments later by his wife who had evidently clothed herself in the\nbest raiment she had. At a call from the old man, all the men, women,\nand children in the settlement came out of their huts and stood in a\nline before us. The old man was spokesman and in his native visayan\ntongue made a heart-rending appeal for aid which we were powerless to\ngive. Attention was called to a leper woman, apparently about\ntwenty-five years of age, whose face had been attacked by the disease\nand whose appearance was truly pathetic. Upon her hip was a child\nabout a year and a half old and, strange to say, the child showed as\nyet no signs whatever of the disease.\n\nWhat an indissoluble enigma is life! Here in a little cluster of grass\nhuts in a secluded nook of a secluded island of an all but secluded\narchipelago was gathered together a little community of wretched\nnatives, driven by their loathsomeness from association with others\neven of the same half-savage race. Yet here, men and women loved and\nwere married, by mutual trust if not by law, and children were born of\nthe union to live forever under the unspeakable horror that\novershadowed the unfortunate parents. Love, hatred, sorrow, and\njoy--every passion that enters into the complex structure of the human\nheart even here, in this scene of sadness and despair, was playing\napparently as freely as where misfortune and disease had never crossed\nthe portals of life.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER IX. - A \"HIKE.\"\n\n\nWe were lounging lazily in our hammocks at Jimamaylan one evening in\nApril. Supper was just ended, and the soldiers in the post were\ncollected in groups here and there spinning yarns to pass away the\ntime, when a Filipino clad only in a loin cloth came down the street\nat a steadily swinging run and stopped in front of the sentry. He\nbrought the announcement that a band of ladrones had just burned a\nsugar mill and were advancing to sack a barrio about fifteen miles\naway.\n\nThe invitation of the commanding officer to go on a \"hike\" was eagerly\naccepted, and, in ten minutes after the message was given, the troops\nwere on the march followed by two adventurous pedagogues.\n\nDarkness was just closing in as we left the town, but a resplendent\ntropic moon soon made the night almost as brilliant as the day. The\ntrail we followed led over rough and rocky country. Sometimes for a\ndistance of a mile or more we passed over barren wastes of volcanic\nslag poured out in anger by some peak whose convulsions have long\nsince ceased. Again we would descend into a tropical jungle from the\ndense foliage of which the ladrones could have leaped at any moment,\nhad they known of our coming, and annihilated our little band. We\nforded rapid streams with the water at our breasts, and halted only\nonce in that rapid march of fifteen miles.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the town we met a man who was standing\nguard against a surprise by the ladrones. Nothing could well have been\nmuch more grotesque and nothing could much better illustrate the\nabsolutely primitive condition of the Filipinos in the interior of the\nislands than the appearance of this guard. A pair of knee pants, a\nconical grass hat, and a hemp shirt formed his entire apparel. A long\nflat wooden shield, a bolo, and a long bamboo spear with a sharp,\nflat, iron point, completed his equipment for battle.\n\nHere stood the first and the twentieth centuries side by side. The\nFilipino who had advanced only a stage beyond the condition of\nprimitive man with his knife, spear, and wooden shield, stood side by\nside with the American soldier, a representative of modern life with\nhis magazine rifle, his canteen, his knapsack,--with every article of\nhis clothing made to give him the highest possible efficiency as the\nunit of a military organization.\n\nA few yards farther on we met another guard equipped similarly to the\nfirst. Upon reaching the town, news had just been received that a\ndetachment of troops from another post had intercepted the ladrones\nand fought a skirmish with them. The ladrones had escaped and we set\nout in pursuit of them on a chase wilder than a Quixotic dream. We\nwound our way into the mountains behind the town, inquiring at every\ngrass hut we passed whether the band of ladrones had passed that way,\nbut only once was even a trace of them found. Then it was learned that\nat a certain place they had separated into groups of three or four and\ngone glimmering through the dream of things that were. This place was\nin a secluded nook of the mountains where in years gone by some\nadventurous Spaniard had erected a primitive water mill to grind his\nsugar-cane. We had now marched about twenty miles and the feet of the\npedagogues were a mass of blisters. They had reached the point where\nthat form of military maneuvering called \"hiking\" ceased to possess\nany alluring charms. So a native was persuaded to come out of his lone\nmountain hut and hitch up his carabao and cart. He was then made to\nget on the carabao's back, while the aforesaid pedagogues lay down on\nthe sugar-cane pulp that had been put into the body of the cart, and\nthe driver was instructed to start for the post we had left hours\nbefore, and not to stop until he got there. Being uncertain but that\nsome of the ladrones would learn of our having left the body of troops\nand would try the metal of our steel, we at first agreed that neither\nof us should go to sleep, but it was later decided that probably the\ndriver had no greater desire to cross the Styx than his passengers had\nand that in case of danger he would awaken us, so both took a revolver\nin each hand, stretched out supinely and went to sleep.\n\nSuch a sleep! The rough jolting of the cart over an almost impassable\nroad was never enough to break the spell of slumber. When we awoke the\nblazing tropic sun was past the midday mark of morning, shining full\ninto our unprotected and well-nigh blistered faces.\n\nA pack of dogs were heralding our approach to a little village at the\nfoot of the mountains where ponies were procured to take us back to\nthe post.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he insists, \"have stood the test of ages; and the plant\nevery where retained its name and credit: and one of our good\nherbarists, who had seen a wonderful case of a swoln spleen, so big, and\nhard as to be felt with terror, brought back to a state of nature by it\"\n\n(p. 37). The greatest portion of Hill's concluding section combines\nadvertisement for the powder medicine he was himself manufacturing at a\nhandsome profit together with a protest against competing apothecaries:\n\"An intelligent person was directed to go to the medicinal herb shops in\nthe several markets, and buy some of this Spleen-wort; the name was\nwritten, and shewn to every one; every shop received his money, and\nalmost every one sold a different plant, under the name of this: but\nwhat is very striking, not one of them the right\" (p. 42).\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis did not cease to be printed after Hill's in\n1766, but continued to issue from the presses into the nineteenth\ncentury. A good example of this is the tome by John Reid, physician to\nthe Finsbury Dispensary in London, Essays on Insanity, Hypochondriasis\nand Other Nervous Affections (1816), which summarizes theories of the\nmalady. A bibliographical study of such works would probably reveal\na larger number of titles in the nineteenth century than in the previous\none, but by this time the nature and definition of hypochondria had\nchanged significantly.\n\nIf John Hill's volume is not an important contribution in the history of\nmedicine, it is a lucid and brief exposition of many of the best ideas\nthat had been thought and written on the hyp, with the exception of his\nuninhibited prescribing of herbal medicines as cure-alls. An\nunderstanding of this disease is essential for readers of neoclassical\nEnglish literature, especially when we reflect upon the fact that some\nof the best literature of the period was composed by writers whom it\nafflicted. It is perhaps not without significance that the greatest poet\nof the Augustan age, Alexander Pope, thought it necessary as he lay on\nhis deathbed in May 1744 to exclaim with his last breath, \"I never was\nhippish in my whole life.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. I. - The NATURE of the DISORDER.\n\n\nTo call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and cruel. It\nis a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by thickened\nand distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver, and other\nparts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick scarce knows\none more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\n\nThe blood is a mixture of many fluids, which, in a state of health, are\nso combined, that the whole passes freely through its appointed vessels;\nbut if by the loss of the thinner parts, the rest becomes too gross to\nbe thus carried through, it will stop where the circulation has least\npower; and having thus stopped it will accumulate; heaping by degrees\nobstruction on obstruction.\n\nHealth and chearfulness, and the quiet exercise of mind, depend upon a\nperfect circulation: is it a wonder then, when this becomes impeded the\nbody looses of its health, and the temper of its sprightliness? to be\notherwise would be the miracle; and he inhumanly insults the afflicted,\nwho calls all this a voluntary frowardness. Its slightest state brings\nwith it sickness, anguish and oppression; and innumerable ills follow\nits advancing steps, unless prevented by timely care; till life itself\ngrows burthensome.\n\nThe disease was common in antient Greece; and her physicians understood\nit, better than those perhaps of later times, in any other country; who\nthough happy in many advantages these fathers of the science could not\nhave, yet want the great assistance of frequent watching it in all its\nstages.\n\nThose venerable writers have delivered its nature, and its cure: in the\nfirst every thing now shews they were right; and what they have said as\nto the latter will be found equally true and certain. This, so far as\npresent experience has confirmed it, and no farther, will be here laid\nbefore the afflicted in a few plain words.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. II. - Persons Subject to it.\n\n\nFatigue of mind, and great exertion of its powers often give birth to\nthis disease; and always tend to encrease it. The finer spirits are\nwasted by the labour of the brain: the Philosopher rises from his study\nmore exhausted than the Peasant leaves his drudgery; without the benefit\nthat he has from exercise. Greatness of mind, and steady virtue;\ndetermined resolution, and manly firmness, when put in action, and\nintent upon their object, all also lead to it: perhaps whatever tends to\nthe ennobling of the soul has equal share in bringing on this weakness\nof the body.\n\nFrom this we may learn easily who are the men most subject to it; the\ngrave and studious, those of a sedate temper and enlarged understanding,\nthe learned and wise, the virtuous and the valiant: those whom it were\nthe interest of the world to wish were free from this and every other\nillness; and who perhaps, except for this alloy, would have too large a\nportion of human happiness.\n\nThough these are most, it is not these alone, who are subject to it.\n\nThere are countries where it is endemial, and in other places some have\nthe seeds of it in their constitution; and in some it takes rise from\naccidents. In these last it is the easiest of cure; and in the first\nmost difficult.\n\nBeside the Greeks already named, the Jews of old time were heavily\nafflicted with this disease; and in their descendants to this day it is\noften constitutional: the Spaniards have it almost to a man; and so have\nthe American Indians. Perhaps the character of these several nations may\nbe connected with it. The steady honour, and firm valour of the\nSpaniard, very like that of the ancient Doric nation, who followed the\nflute not the trumpet to the field; and met the enemy, not with shouts\nand fury, but with a determined virtue: it is the temper of the\nHypochondriac to be slow, but unmoveably resolved: the Jew has shewn\nthis mistakenly, but almost miraculously; and the poor Indian, untaught\nas he is, faces all peril with composure, and sings his death-song with\nan unalter'd countenance.\n\nAmong particular persons the most inquiring and contemplative are those\nwho suffer oftenest by this disease; and of all degrees of men I think\nthe clergy. I do not mean the hunting, shooting, drinking clergy, who\nbear the tables of the great; but the retir'd and conscientious; such as\nattend in midnight silence to their duty; and seek in their own cool\nbreasts, or wheresoever else they may be found, new admonitions for an\nage plunged in new vices. To this disease we owe the irreparable loss of\nDr. YOUNG; and the present danger of many other the best and most\nimproved amongst us. May what is here to be proposed assist in their\npreservation!\n\nThe Geometrician or the learned Philosopher of whatever denomination,\nwhose course of study fixes his eye for ever on one object, his mind\nintensely and continually employed upon one thought, should be warned\nalso that he is in danger; or if he find himself already afflicted, he\nshould be told that the same course of life, which brought it on, will,\nwithout due care, encrease it to the most dreaded violence.\n\nThe middle period of life is that in which there is the greatest danger\nof an attack from this disease; and the latter end of autumn, when the\nsummer heats have a little time been over, is the season when in our\nclimate its first assaults are most to be expected. The same time of the\nyear always increases the disorder in those who have been before\nafflicted with it; and it is a truth must be confessed, that from its\nfirst attack the patient grows continually, though slowly, worse; unless\na careful regimen prevent it.\n\nThe constitutions most liable to this obstruction are the lean, and dark\ncomplexioned; the grave and sedentary. Let such watch the first\nsymptoms; and obviate, (as they may with ease) that which it will be\nmuch more difficult to remove.\n\nIt is happy a disease, wherein the patient must do a great deal for\nhimself, falls, for the most part, upon those who have the powers of\nreason strongest. Let them only be aware of this, that the distemper\nnaturally disposes them to inactivity; and reason will have no use\nunless accompanied with resolution to enforce it.\n\nThough the physician can do something toward the cure, much more depends\nupon the patient; and here his constancy of mind will be employed most\nhappily. No one is better qualified to judge on a fair hearing what\ncourse is the most fit; and having made that choice, he must with\npatience wait its good effects. Diseases that come on slowly must have\ntime for curing; an attention to the first appearances of the disorder\nwill be always happiest; because when least established it is easiest\noverthrown: but when that happy period has been neglected, he must wait\nthe effects of such a course as will dilute and melt the obstructing\nmatter gradually; for till that be done it is not only vain, but\nsometimes dangerous, to attempt its expulsion from the body.\n\nThe blood easily separates itself into the grosser and the thinner\nparts: we see this in bleeding; and from the toughness of the red cake\nmay guess how very difficult it will be to dissolve a substance of like\nfirmness in the vessels of the body. That it can thus become thickened\nwithin the body, a Pleurisy shews us too evidently: in that case it is\nbrought on suddenly, and with inflammation; in this other, slowly and\nwithout; and here, even before it forms the obstruction, can bring on\nmany mischiefs. Various causes can produce the same effect, but that in\nall cases operates most durably, which operates most slowly. The watery\npart of the blood is its mild part; in the remaining gross matter of it,\nare acrid salts and burning oils, and these, when destitute of that\nhappy dilution nature gives them in a healthy body, are capable of doing\ngreat mischief to the tender vessels in which they are kept stagnant.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. III. - The SYMPTOMS of the DISORDER.\n\n\nThe first and lightest of the signs that shew this illness are a lowness\nof spirits, and inaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love\nof solitude and a habit of thinking, even on trifling subjects, with too\nmuch steadiness. A very little help may combat these: but if that\nindolence which is indeed a part of the disorder, will neglect them;\nworse must be expected soon to follow.\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness, weight, and oppression in the body,\na want of appetite, or, what is worse, an appetite without digestion;\nfor these are the conditions of different states of the disease, a\nfullness and a difficulty of breathing after meals, a straitness of the\nbreast, pains and flatulencies in the bowels, and an unaptness to\ndischarge their contents.\n\nThe pulse becomes low, weak, and unequal; and there are frequent\npalpitations of the heart, a little dark-coloured urine is voided at\nsome times; and a flood of colourless and insipid at others; relieving\nfor a moment, but increasing the distemper: there is in some cases also\na continual teazing cough, with a choaking stoppage in the throat at\ntimes; then heartburn, sickness, hardness of the belly, and a costive\nhabit, or a tormenting and vain irritation.\n\nThe lips turn pale, the eyes loose their brightness and by degrees the\nwhite grows as it were greenish, the gums want their due firmness, with\ntheir proper colour; and an unpleasing foulness grows upon the teeth:\nthe inside of the mouth is pale and furred, and the throat dry and\nhusky: the colour of the skin is pale (though there are periods when the\nface is florid) and as the obstruction gathers ground, and more affects\nthe liver, the whole body becomes yellow, tawny, greenish, and at length\nof that deep and dusky hue, to which men of swift imagination have given\nthe name of blackness.\n\nThese symptoms do not all appear in any one period of the disease, or in\none case, but at one time or other all of them, as well as those which\nfollow: the flesh becomes cold to the touch, though the patient does not\nhimself perceive it; the limbs grow numbed and torpid, the breathing\ndull and slow, and the voice hollow; and usually the appetite in this\nperiod declines, and comes almost to nothing: night sweats come on,\nblack swellings appear on the veins, the flesh wastes and the breast\nbecomes flat and hollow: the mouth is full of a thin spittle, the head\nis dizzy and confus'd, and sometimes there is an unconquerable numbness\nin the organs of speech.\n\nI have known the temporary silence that follows upon this last symptom\nbecome a jest to the common herd; and the unhappy patient, instead of\ncompassion and assistance, receive the reproof of sullenness, from those\nwho should have known and acted better.\n\nAbout twenty years ago I met on a visit at Catthorpe in Leicestershire a\nyoung gentleman of distinguished learning and abilities, who at certain\ntimes was speechless. The vulgar thought it a pretence: and a jocose\nlady, where he was at tea with company, putting him as she said to a\ntrial, poured out a dish very strong and without sugar. He drank it and\nreturned the cup with a bow of great reserve, and his eye bent on the\nground: she then filled the cup with sugar, and pouring weak tea on it,\nsent it him: he drank that too, looked at her steadily, and blushed for\nher. The lady declared the man was dumb; the rest thought him perverse,\nand obstinate; but a constant and steady perseverance in an easy method\ncured him.\n\nAll these are miseries which the disease, while it retains its natural\nform, can bring upon the patient; and thus he will in time be worn out,\nand led miserably, though slowly, to the grave. Let him not indulge his\ninactivity so far as to give way to this, because it is represented as\nfar off; the disease may suddenly and frightfully change its nature; and\nswifter evils follow.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. IV. - The DANGER.\n\n\nWe have done with the obstruction considered in itself; but this, though\noften unsurmountable by art, at least by the methods now in use, will be\nsometimes broken through at once by nature, or by accidents; and bring\non fatal evils. These are strictly different diseases, and are no\notherway concerned here, than as the consequences of that of which we\nare treating.\n\nThe thick and glutinous blood which has so long stagnated in the spleen,\nwill have in that time altered its nature, and acquired a very great\ndegree of acrimony: while it lies dormant, this does no more mischiefs,\nthan those named already; but when violent exercise, a fit of outrageous\nanger, or any thing else that suddenly shocks and disturbs the frame,\nputs it in motion, it melts at once into a kind of liquid putrefaction.\n\nBeing now thin, it mixes itself readily with the blood again, and brings\non putrid fevers; destroys the substance of the spleen itself, or being\nthrown upon some other of the viscera, corrodes them, and leads on this\nway a swift and miserable death. If it fall upon the liver, its tender\npulpy substance is soon destroyed, jaundices beyond the help of art\nfirst follow, then dropsies and all their train of misery; if on lungs,\nconsumptions; if on the brain, convulsions, epilepsy, palsy, apoplexy;\nif on the surface, leprosy.\n\nThe intention of cure is to melt this coagulation softly, not to break\nit violently; and then to give it a very gentle passage through the\nbowels. There is no safe way for it to take but that; and even that when\nurged too far may bring on fatal dysenteries.\n\nLet none wonder at the sudden devastation which sometimes arises from\nthis long stagnant matter, when liquified too hastily: how long, how\nmany years the impacted matter will continue quiet in a schirrous tumour\nof the breast; but being once put in motion, whether from accident, or\nin the course of nature, what can describe; or what can stop its\nhavock!\n\nInstances of the other are too frequent. A nobleman the other day died\nparalytick: dissection shewed a spleen consumed by an abscess, formed\nfrom the dissolved matter of such an obstruction: and 'tis scarce longer\nsince, a learned gentleman, who had been several years lost to his\nfriends, by the extreams of a Hypochondriacal disorder, seem'd gradually\nwithout assistance to recover: but the lungs suffered while the spleen\nwas freed; and he died very soon of what is called a galloping\nconsumption.\n\nWhen the obstruction is great and of long continuance, if it be thus\nhastily moved, the consequence is, equally, a sudden and a miserable\ndeath, whether, like the matter of a cancer, it remains in its place; or\nlike that of a bad small pox, be thrown upon some other vital part.\n\nLet not the patient be too much alarmed; this is laid down to caution,\nnot to terrify him: it is fit he should know his danger, and attend to\nit; for the prevention is easy; and the cure, even of the most advanced\nstages, when undertaken by gentle means, is not at all impracticable: to\nassist the physician, let him look into himself, and recollect the\nsource of his complaint. This he may judge of from the following\nnotices.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. V. - The Causes of the HYPOCHONDRIASIS.\n\n\nThe obstruction which forms this disease, may take its origin from\ndifferent accidents: a fever ill cured has often caused it; or the\npiles, which had been used to discharge largely, ceasing; a marshy soil,\npoisoned with stagnant water, has given it to some persons; and altho'\nindolence and inactivity are oftenest at the root, yet it has arisen\nfrom too great exercise.\n\nReal grief has often brought it on; and even love, for sometimes that is\nreal. Study and fixed attention of the mind have been accused before;\nand add to these the stooping posture of the body, which most men use,\nthough none should use it, in writing and in reading. This has\ncontributed too much to it; but of all other things night studies are\nthe most destructive. The steady stillness, and dusky habit of all\nnature in those hours, enforce, encourage, and support that settled\ngloom, which rises from fixt thought; and sinks the body to the grave;\neven while it carries up the mind to heaven. He who would have his lamp\n        At midnight hour\n  Be seen in some high lonely tower,\nwill waste the flame of this unheeded life: and while he labours to\nunsphere the spirit of Plato will let loose his own.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VI. - The Cure of the HYPOCHONDRIASIS.\n\n\nLet him who would escape the mischiefs of an obstructed spleen, avoid\nthe things here named: and let him who suffers from the malady,\nendeavour to remember to which of them it has been owing; for half the\nhope depends upon that knowledge.\n\nNature has sometimes made a cure herself, and we should watch her ways;\nfor art never is so right as when it imitates her: sometimes the\npatient's own resolution has set him free. This is always in his power,\nand at all times will do wonders.\n\nThe bleeding of the piles, from nature's single efforts, has at once\ncured a miserable man; where their cessation was the cause of the\ndisorder. A leprosy has appeared upon the skin, and all the symptoms of\nthe former sickness vanished. This among the Jews happened often: both\ndiseases we know were common among them: and I have here seen something\nvery like it: Water-Dock has thrown out scorbutic eruptions, and all the\nformer symptoms of an Hypochondriacal disorder have disappeared:\nreturning indeed when these were unadvisedly struck in; but keeping off\nentirely when they were better treated. A natural purging unsuppressed\nhas sometimes done the same good office: but this is hazardous.\n\nIt is easy to be directed from such instances; only let us take the\nwhole along with us. Bleeding would have answered nature's purpose, if\nshe could not have opened of herself the h\u00e6morrhoidal vessels; but he\nwho should give medicines for that purpose, might destroy his patient by\ntoo great disturbance. If a natural looseness may perform the cure, so\nmay an artificial; when the original source of the disorder points that\nway. But these are helps that take place only in particular cases.\n\nThe general and universal method of cure must be by some mild and gently\nresolving medicine, under the influence of which the obstructing matter\nmay be voided that, or some other way with safety. The best season to\nundertake this is the autumn, but even here there must be caution.\n\nIn the first place, no strong evacuating remedy must be given; for that,\nby carrying off the thinner parts of the juices, will tend to thicken\nthe remainder; and certainly encrease the distemper. No acrid medicine\nmust be directed, for that may act too hastily, dissolve the impacted\nmatter at once, and let it loose, to the destruction of the sufferer; no\nantimonial, no mercurial, no martial preparation must be taken; in\nshort, no chymistry: nature is the shop that heaven has set before us,\nand we must seek our medicine there. The venerable ancients, who knew\nnot this new art, will lead us in the search; and (faithful relators as\nthey are of truth) will tell us whence we may deduce our hope; and what\nwe are to fear.\n\nBut prior to the course of any medicine, and as an essential to any good\nhope from it, the patient must prescribe himself a proper course of\nlife, and a well chosen diet: let us assist him in his choice; and speak\nof this first, as it comes first in order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VI. - Rules of Life for Hypochondriac Persons.\n\n\nAir and exercise, as they are the best preservers of health, and\ngreatest assistants in the cure of all long continued diseases, will\nhave their full effect in this; but there requires some caution in the\nchoice, and management of them. It is common to think the air of high\ngrounds best; but experience near home shews otherwise: the\nHypochondriac patient is always worse at Highgate even than in London.\n\nThe air he breathes should be temperate; not exposed to the utmost\nviolences of heat and cold, and the swift changes from one to the\nother; which are most felt on those high grounds. The side of a hill is\nthe best place for him: and though wet grounds are hurtful; yet let\nthere be the shade of trees, to tempt him often to a walk; and soften by\ntheir exhalation the over dryness of the air.\n\nThe exercise he takes should be frequent; but not violent. Motion\npreserves the firmness of the parts, and elasticity of the vessels; it\nprevents that aggregation of thick humours which he is most to fear. A\nsedentary life always produces weakness, and that mischief always\nfollows: weak eyes are gummy, weak lungs are clogged with phlegm, and\nweak bowels waste themselves in vapid diarrhoeas.\n\nLet him invite himself abroad, and let his friends invite him by every\ninnocent inducement. For me, I should advise above all other things the\nstudy of nature. Let him begin with plants: he will here find a\ncontinual pleasure, and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful\nthings; even of the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to\nwalk; and every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket,\nwill afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually\nin the air, and continually to change the nature and quality of the air,\nby visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the lawn, the\nheath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be abroad; and the\nunceasing variety of the subjects of his observation, will prevent his\nwalking hastily: he will pursue his studies in the air; and that\ncontemplative turn of mind, which in his closet threatened his\ndestruction, will thus become the great means of his recovery.\n\nIf the mind tire upon this, from the repeated use, another of nature's\nkingdoms opens itself at once upon him; the plant he is weary of\nobserving, feeds some insect he may examine; nor is there a stone that\nlies before his foot, but may afford instruction and amusement.\n\nEven what the vulgar call the most abject things will shew a wonderful\nutility; and lead the mind, in pious contemplation higher than the\nstars. The poorest moss that is trampled under foot, has its important\nuses: is it at the bottom of a wood we find it? why there it shelters\nthe fallen seeds; hides them from birds, and covers them from frost;\nand thus becomes the foster father of another forest! creeps it along\nthe surface of a rock? even there its good is infinite! its small roots\nrun into the stone, and the rains make their way after them; the moss\nhaving lived its time dies; it rots and with the mouldered fragments of\nthe stone forms earth; wherein, after a few successions, useful plants\nmay grow, and feed more useful cattle!\n\nIs there a weed more humble in its aspect, more trampled on, or more\ndespised than knot grass! no art can get the better of its growth, no\nlabour can destroy it; 'twere pity if they could, for the thing lives\nwhere nothing would of use to us; and its large and most wonderfully\nabundant seeds, feed in hard winters, half the birds of Heaven.\n\nWhat the weak moss performs upon the rock the loathed toadstool brings\nabout in timber: is an oak dead where man's eye will not find it? this\nfungus roots itself upon the bark, and rots the wood beneath it; hither\nthe beetle creeps for shelter, and for sustenance; him the woodpecker\nfollows as his prey; and while he tears the tree in search of him, he\nscatters it about the ground; which it manures.\n\nNor is it the beetle alone that thus insinuates itself into the\nsubstance of the vegetable tribe: the tender aphide, whom a touch\ndestroys, burrows between the two skins of a leaf, for shelter from his\nwinged enemies; tracing, with more than Dedal\u00e6an art, his various\nmeanders; and veining the green surface with these white lines more\nbeautifully than the best \u00c6gyptian marble.\n\n'Twere endless to proceed; nor is it needful: one object will not fail\nto lead on to another, and every where the goodness of his God will\nshine before him even in what are thought the vilest things; his\ngreatness in the lead of them.\n\nLet him pursue these thoughts, and seek abroad the objects and the\ninstigations to them: but let him in these and all other excursions\navoid equally the dews of early morning, and of evening.\n\nThe more than usual exercise of this prescription will dispose him to\nmore than customary sleep, let him indulge it freely; so far from\nhurting, it will help his cure.\n\nLet him avoid all excesses: drink need scarce be named, for we are\nwriting to men of better and of nobler minds, than can be tempted to\nthat humiliating vice. Those who in this disorder have too great an\nappetite, must not indulge it; much eaten was never well digested: but\nof all excesses the most fatal in this case is that of venery. It is the\nexcess we speak of.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VII. - The proper DIET.\n\n\nIn the first place acids must be avoided carefully; and all things that\nare in a state of fermentation, for they will breed acidity. Provisions\nhardened by salting never should be tasted; much less those cured by\nsmoaking, and by salting. Bacon is indigestible in an Hypochondriac\nstomach; and hams, impregnated as is now the custom, with acid fumes\nfrom the wood fires over which they are hung, have that additional\nmischief.\n\nMilk ought to be a great article in the diet: and even in this there\nshould be choice. The milk of grass-fed cows has its true quality: no\nother. There are a multitude of ways in which this may be made a part\nboth of our foods and drinks, and they should all be used.\n\nThe great and general caution is that the diet be at all times of a kind\nloosening and gently stimulating; light but not acrid. Veal, lamb,\nfowls, lobsters, crabs, craw-fish, fresh water fish and mutton broth,\nwith plenty of boiled vegetables, are always right; and give enough\nvariety.\n\nRaw vegetables are all bad: sour wines, old cheese, and bottled beer are\nthings never to be once tasted. Indeed much wine is wrong, be it of what\nkind soever. It is the first of cordials; and as such I would have it\ntaken in this disease when it is wanted: plainly as a medicine, rather\nthan a part of diet. Malt liquor carefully chosen is certainly the best\ndrink. This must be neither new, nor tending to sourness; perfectly\nclear, and of a moderate strength: it is the native liquor of our\ncountry, and the most healthful.\n\nToo much tea weakens; and even sugar is in this disorder hurtful: but\nhoney may supply its place in most things; and this is not only harmless\nbut medicinal; a very powerful dissolvent of impacted humours, and a\ngreat deobstruent.\n\nWhat wine is drank should be of some of the sweet kinds. Old Hock has\nbeen found on enquiry to yield more than ten times the acid of the sweet\nwines; and in red Port, at least in what we are content to call so,\nthere is an astringent quality, that is most mischievous in these cases:\nit is said there is often alum in it: how pregnant with mischief that\nmust be to persons whose bowels require to be kept open, is most\nevident. Summer fruits perfectly ripe are not only harmless but\nmedicinal; but if eaten unripe they will be very prejudicial. A light\nsupper, which will leave an appetite for a milk breakfast, is always\nright; this will not let the stomach be ravenous for dinner, as it is\napt to be in those who make that their only meal.\n\nOne caution more must be given, and it may seem a strange one: it is\nthat the patient attend regularly to his hours of eating. We have to do\nwith men for the most part whose soul is the great object of their\nregard; but let them not forget they have a body.\n\nThe late Dr. STUKELY has told me, that one day by appointment visiting\nSir ISAAC NEWTON, the servant told him, he was in his study. No one was\npermitted to disturb him there; but as it was near dinner time, the\nvisitor sat down to wait for him. After a time dinner was brought in; a\nboil'd chicken under a cover. An hour pass'd, and Sir ISAAC did not\nappear. The doctor eat the fowl, and covering up the empty dish, bad\nthem dress their master another. Before that was ready, the great man\ncame down; he apologiz'd for his delay, and added, \"give me but leave to\ntake my short dinner, and I shall be at your service; I am fatigued and\nfaint.\" Saying this, he lifted up the cover; and without any emotion,\nturned about to STUKELY with a smile; \"See says he, what we studious\npeople are, I forgot I had din'd.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VIII. - The MEDICINE.\n\n\n'Tis the ill fate of this disease, more than of all others to be\nmisunderstood at first, and thence neglected; till the physician shakes\nhis head at a few first questions. None steals so fatally upon the\nsufferer: its advances are by very slow degrees; but every day it grows\nmore difficult of cure.\n\nThat this obstruction in the spleen is the true malady, the cases\nrelated by the antients, present observation, and the unerring\ntestimonies of dissections leave no room to doubt. Being understood, the\npath is open where to seek a remedy: and our best guides in this, as in\nthe former instance, will be those venerable Greeks; who saw a thousand\nof these cases, where we see one; and with less than half our theory,\ncured twice as many patients.\n\nOne established doctrine holds place in all these writers; that whatever\nby a hasty fermentation dissolves the impacted matter of the\nobstruction, and sends it in that state into the blood, does incredible\nmischief: but that whatever medicine softens it by slow degrees, and, as\nit melts, delivers it to the bowels without disturbance; will cure with\nequal certainty and safety.\n\nFor this good purpose, they knew and tried a multitude of herbs; but in\nthe end they fixed on one: and on their repeated trials of this, they\nbanished all the rest. This stood alone for the cure of the disease; and\nfrom its virtue received the name of SPLEEN-WORT. O wise and happy\nGreeks! authors of knowledge and perpetuators of it! With them the very\nname they gave a plant declared its virtues: with us, a writer calls a\nplant from some friend; that the good gardener who receives the honour,\nmay call another by his name who gave it. We now add the term smooth\nto this herb, to distinguish it from another, called by the same general\nterm, though not much resembling it.\n\nThe virtues of this smooth Spleen-wort have flood the test of ages; and\nthe plant every where retained its name and credit: and one of our good\nherbalists, who had seen a wonderful case of a swoln spleen, so big, and\nhard as to be felt with terror, brought back to a state of nature by it;\nand all the miserable symptoms vanish; thought Spleen-wort not enough\nexpressive of its excellence; but stamp'd on it the name of MILT-WASTE.\n\nIn the Greek Islands now, the use of it is known to every one; and even\nthe lazy monks who take it, are no longer splenetic. In the west of\nEngland, the rocks are stripped of it with diligence; and every old woman\ntells you how charming that leaf is for bookish men: in Russia they use\na plant of this kind in their malt liquor: it came into fashion there\nfor the cure of this disease; which from its constant use is scarce\nknown any longer; and they suppose 'tis added to their liquor for a\nflavour.\n\nThe ancients held it in a kind of veneration; and used what has been\ncalled a superstition in the gathering it. It was to be taken up with a\nsharp knife, without violence, and laid upon the clean linen: no time\nbut the still darkness of the night was proper, and even the moon was\nnot to shine upon it. I know they have been ridiculed for this; for\nnothing is so vain as learned ignorance: but let me be permitted once to\nvindicate them.\n\nThe plant has leaves that can close in their sides; and their under part\nis covered thick with a yellow powder, consisting of the seeds, and seed\nvessels: in these they knew the virtue most resided: this was the golden\ndust they held so valuable; and this they knew they could not be too\ncautious to preserve. They were not ignorant of the sleep of plants; a\nmatter lately spoken of by some, as if a new discovery; and being\nsensible that light, a dry air, an expanded leaf, and a tempestuous\nseason, were the means of losing this fine dust; and knowing also that\ndarkness alone brought on that closing of the leaf which thence has\nbeen called sleep; and which helped to defend and to secure it, they\ntherefore took such time, and used such means as could best preserve the\nplant entire; and even save what might be scattered from it.--And now\nwhere is their superstition?\n\nFrom this plant thus collected they prepared a medicine, which in a\ncourse of forty days scarce ever failed to make a perfect cure.\n\nWe have the plant wild with us; and till the fashion of rough chemical\npreparations took off our attention from these gentler remedies, it was\nin frequent use and great repute. I trust it will be so again: and many\nthank me for restoring it to notice.\n\nSpleen-wort gives out its virtues freely in a tincture; and a small dose\nof this, mixing readily with the blood and juices, gradually dissolves\nthe obstruction; and by a little at a time delivers its contents to be\nthrown off without pain, from the bowels. Let this be done while the\nviscera are yet sound and the cure is perfect. More than the forty days\nof the Greek method is scarce ever required; much oftener two thirds of\nthat time suffice; and every day, from the first dose of it, the patient\nfeels the happy change that is growing in his constitution. His food no\nmore turns putrid on his stomach, but yields its healthful nourishment.\n\nThe swelling after meals therefore vanishes; and with that goes the\nlowness, and anxiety, the difficult breath, and the distracting cholick:\nhe can bear the approach of rainy weather without pain; he finds himself\nmore apt for motion, and ready to take that exercise which is to be\nassistant in his cure; life seems no longer burthensome. His bowels get\ninto the natural condition of health, and perform their office once at\nleast a day; better if a little more: the dull and dead colour of his\nskin goes off, his lips grow red again, and every sign of health\nreturns.\n\nLet him who takes the medicine, say whether any thing here be\nexaggerated. Let him, if he pleases to give himself the trouble, talk\nover with me, or write to me, this gradual decrease of his complaints,\nas he proceeds in his cure. My uncertain state of health does not\npermit me to practise physic in the usual way, but I am very desirous to\ndo what good I can, and shall never refuse my advice, such as it may be,\nto any person rich or poor, in whatever manner he may apply for it. I\nshall refer him to no apothecary, whose bills require he should be\ndrenched with potions; but tell him, in this as in all other cases,\nwhere to find some simple herb; which he may if he please prepare\nhimself; or if he had rather spare that trouble, may have it so prepared\nfrom me.\n\nWith regard to Spleen-wort, no method of using it is more effectual than\nsimply taking it in powder; the only advantage of a tincture, is that a\nproper dose may be given, and yet the stomach not be loaded with so\nlarge a quantity: it is an easier and pleasanter method, and nothing\nmore.\n\nIf any person choose to take it in the other way, I should still wish\nhim once at least to apply to me; that he may be assured what he is\nabout to take is the right plant. Abuses in medicines are at this time\nvery great, and in no instance worse than what relates to herbs. The\nbest of our physicians have complained upon this head with warmth, but\nwithout redress: they know the virtues and the value of many of our\nnative plants, but dread to prescribe them; lest some wrong thing should\nbe administered in their place; perhaps inefficacious, perhaps\nmischievous, nay it may be fatal. The few simple things I direct are\nalways before me; and it will at all times be a pleasure to me, in this\nand any other instance, to see whether what any person is about to take\nbe right. I have great obligations to the public, and this is the best\nreturn that I know how to make.\n\nTo see the need of such a caution, hear a transaction but of yesterday!\n\nAn intelligent person was directed to go to the medicinal herb shops in\nthe several markets, and buy some of this Spleen-wort; the name was\nwritten, and shewn to every one; every shop received his money, and\nalmost every one sold a different plant, under the name of this: but\nwhat is very striking, not one of them the right. Such is the chance of\nhealth in those hands through which the best means of it usually pass;\neven in the most regular course of application.\n\nI would not be understood to limit the little services I may this way be\nable to render the afflicted, to this single instance; much less to\npropose to myself any advantages from it. Whoever pleases will be\nwelcome to me, upon any such occasion; and whatever be the herb on which\nhe places a dependance, he shall be shewn it growing. I once recommended\na garden to be established for this use, at the public expence: one\ngreat person has put it in my power to answer all its purposes.\n\n                        F  I  N  I  S.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris, he was\n\"nominated\" to the Academy. He had but to present an Historical\nPainting in order to take his seat as an Academician.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VENUS AND MARRIAGE\n\n\nBack in his beloved Paris again; thrilled by the atmosphere and gaiety\nof its merry life; in the full vigour of manhood on the eve of his\nthirties; amongst congenial friends; done with the drudgery of winning\nto Academic honour, Boucher saw that the public were not falling over\neach other to purchase religious or historic pictures; he straightway\nturned his back upon these things, and on the edge of his thirtieth\nyear he gave to the world his \"Marriage of the Children of God with\nthe Children of Men,\" in which Venus is the avowed mistress of his\nadoration. It caused a fine stir, and greatly increased his repute.\n\nIn this picture he ends his Italian period and strikes his own\npersonal note. Both this and the \"Venus asking arms for Aeneas from\nVulcan,\" together with the \"Birth of Adonis\" and the \"Death of\nAdonis,\" of about the same period, still show Boucher strongly under\nthe influence of his master, Lemoyne. Indeed, the \"Birth\" and \"Death\nof Adonis,\" their record lost during the scuffle and confusion of the\nRevolution, for long hung side by side as pictures by Lemoyne, until,\nbeing cleaned about 1860, Boucher's initials were discovered upon\nthem, and, contemporary engravings being hunted up, still further\nproved their origin. But in the Venus that now figures in all his\nworks there is that flesh-painting of the nude, and that rosy touch\nupon the flesh of the female figure, that are a far more certain\nsignature of Boucher's handiwork than any written name.\n\nUnfortunately the Salons were closed during Boucher's earlier years\nuntil he was thirty-four, and the record of his work during these\nyears is difficult to follow; but with his service to Venus his\npersonal career begins, and the stream of his Venus-pieces steadily\nflows from his hands.\n\nHe came to her service rid of all prentice essays in craftsmanship, a\nfinished and consummate artist. He found in his subject a goddess to\nwhom he could devote his great and splendid gifts. He painted her\ndainty body with a radiant delight and a rare colour-sense such as\nFrance had never before seen or uttered. He remains to this day the\nfirst painter of the subtle, delicate, and elusive thing that is\nfemininity; he caught her allure, her charm, as he was to catch the\nfragrance and charm of children and flowers; and he set the statement\nof these things upon canvas as they have never been uttered.\n\nThe whole of his life long, Boucher gave himself up with equal and\npassionate devotion to work and to pleasure--working at his easel\noften twelve hours of his day without losing, to the end when the\nbrush fell from his dead fingers, his blitheness of heart or his\ngenerosity of act, and without weakening the pleasure-loving desires\nof his gadding spirit. Out of his splendid toil he made the means to\nindulge his tastes for pleasure; and the gratifying of his tastes in\nturn renewed and created the ideas that made the subjects of his\nartistry. He brought to all he did a joy in the doing that made of his\nvast labour one long pleasure--of his pleasures a riot of industry. He\nplayed as he toiled, scarce knowing which was play and which toil.\n\nThe gossip of his love-affairs makes no romantic story--they were but\ncommonplace ecstasies with unknown frail women. But hard as he worked\nand lived and played, he found time to get himself married in his\nthirtieth year to pretty seventeen-year-old Marie Jeanne Buseau, a\nlittle Parisian--and for love of her, so far as he understood the\nbusiness; for she brought him no dowry.\n\nThe young couple settled down for the next ten years in the Rue\nSaint-Thomas-du-Louvre. Here Boucher lived through his thirties.\n\nMadame was a pretty creature, if we had but Latour's pastel portrait\nalone to prove it. But the pretty features were the crown to as pretty\na body, for she sat often to her lord; and it is clear from his\ncorrespondence with a friend, Bachaumont, that she is the Psyche of\nhis illustrated fable--and Psyche runs much to the Altogether.\n\nMarriage, however, was not likely to imprison Boucher's gadding eyes;\nand it did not. Madame Boucher seems to have had as frail a heart, and\navoided strife by amusing herself, amongst others, with the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who, to gain access to the lady,\ncommissioned Boucher to do the Watteau-like illustrations to\nAcajou--a dull affair. Boucher's pretty wife, herself no mean\nartist, worked in his studio, and painted several smaller canvases\nafter his pictures, gaining some fame as a miniaturist and engraver.\n\nNor did Marriage turn Boucher from his art. Two years were gone by\nsince his nomination to the Academy; he had now to paint the formal\nHistorical Picture and present it in order to take his seat as\nAcademician; and it was in this his thirtieth year that he painted and\nwon his academic rank with the \"Renauld et Armide\" now at the Louvre.\n\nHere he sufficiently subordinated his own style to the academic to\nensure success; and the work was hailed by Academicians and critics,\nincluding Diderot, with enthusiasm. But even here we have his cupids\npeeping round the mythologic event; and Armide herself has pretty\nFrench lips that knew no Greek.\n\nOnce secure of his position, he straightway flung the last remnants of\nthe academic style out of his studio door; and it is a grim comment on\ncriticism that it was just exactly in proportion as he developed his\nown personal genius and uttered the France of his day, that he was\nattacked; whilst the stilted things that he knew were third-rate, and\nwhich he wholly rejected from henceforth, were exactly the things that\nwere praised!\n\nHis election to the Academy, and the enthusiasm over the picture that\nwon him his seat thereat, brought his name before the young king; the\nfollowing year he received his first order from the Court whose\npainter he was destined to become. The decorations in the queen's\napartments were gloomy and had grown black; and he painted in their\nstead the \"Charity,\" \"Abundance,\" \"Fidelity,\" and \"Prudence\" still\nthere to be seen. Indeed, with his gay vision, his pretty habit of\nculling only the flowers from the garden of life, and his quickness to\nset down the pleasing thing in every prospect, Boucher was the\ndestined painter of a Court weary of pomposity and the pose of the\nmock-heroic, and which was wholly giving itself up to pleasure and the\nelegances.\n\nBut neither his new dignity of Academician nor the royal favour, kept\nhim from the bookshops; and he illustrated, with rare beauty and a\ncharm worthy of Watteau, the great edition of the Works of Moli\u00e8re\nin his thirty-first year. It is true that he made as free with\nMoli\u00e8re's world as with the Gods of Olympus; he peoples the plays with\ncharacters of his own day, arrayed in the dress and habit of that day,\nand moving in surroundings that he saw about him.\n\n\nLE MONDE QUI S'AMUSE\n\n\nThe Homely had come upon the town out of Holland, painted with most\nconsummate artistry by Chardin, and was soon in the vogue. Boucher had\na quick eye for the mode. And he straightway set himself to the\npainting of \"La Belle Cuisini\u00e8re.\" Still-life and homely subjects need\nan accuracy of realism and a Dutch sense of these things, a sense of\nsincerity and an appreciation of the dignity of the work-a-day life of\nthe people, in which Boucher was wholly lacking. Above all, it calls\nfor a sense of \"character,\" which, in Boucher, was always weak. It was\na sneer against him that his very broomsticks called for pompons and\nribbons--and there was more than a little truth in the spite. He is\nmore concerned with the accident of the kissing of a kitchen-maid than\nwith the kitchen's habit. He cannot even peep into a scullery without\ndragging in Venus by the skirts, and tricking her out in a\nproperty-wardrobe of a scullery-wench, in which the girl is clearly\nbut acting the part.\n\nHowever, these passing vogues and experiments in different methods\nwere only gay asides--he was working the while upon his own subjects;\nand, to the display by its several members ordered by the Academy, he\nsent four little paintings of fauns and cupids which won him the\nhonour of election as deputy-professor. His brain and hand were very\nbusy, and he turns from one thing to another with amazing facility,\nbringing distinction to all that he does.\n\nBut he painted about this time two pictures of infants, \"L'Amour\nOiseleur\" and \"L'Amour Moissonneur,\" which were the beginning of that\nhost of cupids that he let fly from his studio; they frolic across his\ncanvases and join the retinue of Venus, peeping out from clouds, over\nwaves, round curtains, painted with a perfection that has never been\nsurpassed in the portrayal of infants. He painted their round limbs,\ntheir lusty life, their delightful awkwardnesses, their jolly fat\ngrace, their na\u00efve surprise at life and glory in it, as they had never\nbeen painted before, and have never been painted since.\n\nHe also gave forth in this his thirty-third year a \"Pastoral\" and a\n\"Shepherd and Shepherdess in Conversation,\" with sheep about them and\nin a pleasant landscape, which were his first essays in the style that\nhe created and which made him famous.\n\nHis friend Meissonnier, the inventor of the rococo, stood godfather to\nBoucher's first-born son in the May of 1736.\n\nFrom the very beginning Boucher seems to have been engraved. And these\nengravings, done by the best gravers of his day, greatly extended his\nreputation and popularised him; he fully realised the value of the\nadvertisement as well as his profits from it. Before his thirty-third\nyear was run out he published his well-known \"Cries of Paris.\"\n\nBoucher's description of them, \"studies from the low classes,\" holds\nthe key to that something of failure to realise the dramatic verities\nthat is over all; it gives also the attitude of the France that he\nknew towards the France that he did not, and could not understand. He\ncreated that dainty, pleasant atmosphere that comes floating up to the\nwindows on a fresh morning in Paris from the musical cries of\nthe street vendors; but of the deeper significance of the\nstreet-sellers--of the miserable accent in their life, of their weary\ntoil, of the dignity of their labour--he knew nothing; his brush could\nnot refrain from making elegance and fine manners peep from behind the\nstreet-porter's fustian or the milkmaid's skirt.\n\nBut his thirty-third year was to contain a more far-reaching\nsignificance even than the creation of his cupid-pieces and pastorals.\n\nThe \"Cries of Paris\" were scarce printed when Boucher's illustration\nto \"Don Quixote\" appeared--\"Sancho pursued by the servants of the\nDuke.\" This design was to have far-reaching results that Boucher\nlittle suspected.\n\nThe painter Oudry had been called to the conduct of the great tapestry\nlooms at Beauvais a couple of years before; and in his efforts to\nfurnish the looms with good designs, he now called Boucher to his aid,\nwhose original and fresh style, colour, and arrangement, together with\nhis personal vision, and the enthusiasm and zeal with which he threw\nhimself into the work, at once increased the reputation and the\nproducts of the famous looms. This large designing for the tapestries\nwas, in return, of immense value to the development of the genius of\nthe man, enlarging his breadth of style and giving scope to that great\ndecorative sense that was his superb gift. Thenceforth he was destined\nto play a supreme part in the history of the world-famed factories. He\nnow produced painting after painting for the Beauvais looms.\n\nLife is now one long triumph for Boucher, only disturbed in this year\nby the sad news of the suicide of his old master, Lemoyne. It was in\nthis, Boucher's thirty-fourth year, that the Salon was opened for the\nfirst time since Boucher's infancy, and he contributed several\ncanvases to it.\n\nRigaud, the old Academician, now close upon eighty, straggling through\nthe great galleries, might well blink and gasp at the change that had\ncome over French art since he last exhibited there, thirty-three years\ngone by; but his scoffs and regrets held no terrors for the younger\nAcademicians gathered about. He stood in a new world. A new generation\nwas in possession. The grand manner, the severe etiquette, formal\nmock-heroics, and solemn pomposity of Louis the Fourteenth were\nvanished, and the Agreeable and the Pleasant Make-Believe of Louis the\nFifteenth reigned in their stead. Old Rigaud might blink indeed! Just\nas the imposing and stilted etiquette of the reception-room had given\nplace to the easy manners and airy etiquette of the dainty boudoir, so\nhad light chatter and gay wit and the quick repartee usurped the heavy\nsplendours of a consequential age. France, weary of an eternal pose of\nthe grand manner, was seeking change in joyousness and amusement.\n\nGallantry and gaiety were become the object of the ambition of a\ndandified and elegant day. France became a coquette; dressed herself\nas a porcelain shepherdess; and with beribboned crook and sheep,\nseeking pleasant prospects to stroll through, gave herself to\ndalliance--her powder-puff and patch-box and fan a serious part of her\nunseriousness.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE CH\u00c2TEAUROUX\n\n\nAt thirty-five Boucher has arrived. He is in the vogue; in favour at\nCourt--as well as in the fashion. In his three years from taking his\nseat at the Academy to the opening of the first Salon he has created a\nnew and original style--his cupid pieces, his pastorals, his\nVenus-pieces, his tapestry. Boucher's kingdom lay in the realm of the\ndecorative painter--and he has found it. Torn from the surroundings\nfor which he designed them, as part and parcel of the general scheme,\nhis pictures are as out of place as an Italian altarpiece in an\nEnglish dining-room, yet they suffer less. Several may still be seen,\nas he set them up in frames of his own planning, as overdoors in the\npalace of the Soubise, now given up to the national archives.\n\nThe ghost of the Prince of Soubise, who commissioned them, may haunt\nhis palace, but his kin know the place no longer. The overdoors\nwrought by Boucher's skill look down now on the nation's collection of\nhistoric documents. The \"Three Graces enchaining Love,\" the fine\npastoral of \"The Cage,\" and the pastoral of the \"Shepherd placing a\nRose in his Shepherdess's Hair,\" were to see a mightier change than\nthe usurpation of Louis the Fourteenth's pompous age by the elegant\nyears of Louis the Fifteenth. But this was not as yet. Here at least\nwe see Boucher's art rid of all outside influences, and at the full\ntide of creation; here we have the inimitable lightness of touch, the\nfigures and landscape bathed in the airy volume of atmosphere.\n\nHe seems at this time to have played with pastel, due probably to his\nfriendship with Latour, who sent a portrait of Boucher's wife to this\nSalon. Boucher showed in the use of chalks the artistry and skill that\nwere always at his command.\n\nHe also was putting to its full use his innate sense of landscape,\nraising to high achievement that astonishing balance of landscape and\nfigures in his design--a balance that has never been surpassed; his\nfigures never override his landscape; his landscape never overpowers\nhis figures. His earnest counsels to his pupils and his constant\ndeploring of the lack of the landscape art in France prove the great\nstress he laid upon it.\n\nThe designing of a frontispiece for the catalogue of a personal\nfriend, one Gersaint, a merchant of oriental wares, started Boucher in\nhis thirty-third year upon that series of Chinese pictures and\ntapestries known as the \"Chinoiseries,\" in which he frittered away\nonly too many precious hours, for they were received with great favour\nby the public. The paintings of Chinese subjects designed for the\nlooms of Beauvais are still to be seen at Besan\u00e7on.\n\nBut busy as were his brain and hand in the exercise of his wide and\nversatile gifts, pouring out \"Chinoiseries,\" illustrations for books,\ntapestries on a large scale, landscapes, models for the gilt bronze\ndecorations of porcelain vases, scheming handsome frames for his\npictures, designing furniture and fans--Boucher was true, above all,\n\"to his goddess,\" and painted the famed \"Birth of Venus,\" which,\nthanks to the Swedish Ambassador's fondness for Madame Boucher, now\nhangs at Stockholm; our amorous Count de Tessin, to be just, seems to\nhave had a rare flair for the artistic--besides artist's wives. It was\non the 15th of April in 1742, the last year of his thirties, that the\nRoyal favour was marked by the grant of a pension of 400 livres\n(double florins) to Boucher with promise of early benefits to follow.\n\nTwo years afterwards it was raised to 600 livres.\n\nThis was the year that he painted the beautiful canvas of \"Diana\nleaving the Bath with one of her Companions,\" now at the Louvre. It\nwas also the year that saw his landscape, the \"Hamlet of Iss\u00e9\" at the\nSalon. This \"Hameau d'Iss\u00e9\" was to be enlarged for the Opera, proving\nhim to be decorator there, where he was arranging waterfalls,\ncascades, and the rest of the pretty business, without staying his\nhand from his art.\n\nAt forty Boucher has come into his kingdom. The ten years of these\nforties were to be a vast triumph for him. He was to produce\nmasterpiece after masterpiece. His art had caught the taste of the\nday. He was at the height of his powers. He had done great things--he\nwas to do greater. During these ten years of his forties he poured\nforth vivid and glowing works of sustained power and originality.\n\nWe have a picture of him as he was in the flesh at this time--the\npastel portrait by Lundberg, now at the Louvre--a gay, somewhat\ndissipated, handsomely dressed dandy of the time, smiling out of his\ncareless day, the debonnair man of fashion, the laughing eyes showing\nsigns of the night carousals, which were the rest from the prodigious\ntoil of this vital and forthright spirit.\n\nIt was in this our artist's fortieth year that the gifted old Cardinal\nFleury, who had guided the fortunes of France with rare skill, died,\nbroken by his ninety years and the blunders of the disastrous war that\nhe had so strenuously opposed; and Louis, essaying the strut of\nkingship, became king by act. His indolent character, unequal to the\nmighty business, his indeterminate will fretted by the set of\nquarrelling and intriguing rogues that he gathered about him as his\nministers, he fell into the habit that became his thenceforth, the\nonly thing to which he paid the tribute of constancy--he ruled France\nfrom behind pretty petticoats. He had early shown the adulterous blood\nof his great-grandfather; two, if not three, of five sisters of the\nnoble and historic house of De Nesle had yielded to his gadding fancy;\nthe youngest now ousted her sister De Mailly from the king's favour,\nwas publicly acknowledged as the king's mistress, and became Duchess\nof Ch\u00e2teauroux. Boucher painted her handsome being as a shepherdess in\none of his pastorals. She was no ordinary toy of a king. A woman of\ntalent, with hot ambitions for the king's majesty, fired with the\npride of race of the old French noblesse, it was during her short\nyears of ascendancy over the king that he roused from his body's\ntorpor and made an effort to reach the dignity and eminence befitting\nto the lord of a great and gallant people. He stepped forth awhile\nfrom his drunken bouts and manifold mean adulteries, and set himself\nat the head of the army in Flanders, and strutted it as conqueror.\n\nPoor Ch\u00e2teauroux only got the hate of the people for reward, Louis the\nhonours; for the people resented the public dishonour of her state.\n\nPower she found to be a dead-sea apple in her pretty mouth. The glory\nof it all, the splendours, were not the easily won delights for which\nshe had looked. She had to fight a duel, that never ended, with the\nking's witty, crafty, and scurrilous Prime Minister, the notorious\nMaurepas--and Maurepas willed that no woman should ever come between\nhim and the king--Maurepas who knew no mercy, no decency, no chivalry,\nno scruple. At Ch\u00e2teauroux's urging, Louis placed himself at the\nhead of the army; and France went near mad with joy that she had\nagain found a king. Crafty Maurepas urged on the business; the\nCh\u00e2teauroux suddenly realised his cunning glee--it separated her from\nthe king.\n\nOut of the whirl of things Boucher's fortune was ripening, little as\nhe might suspect it.\n\nHe was painting masterpieces that make his name live. To his fortieth\nyear belong the famed \"Birth of Venus,\" the \"Venus leaving the Bath,\"\nthe \"Muse Clio,\" the \"Muse Melpomene,\" and the three well-known\npastorals now at the Louvre--\"The Sleeping Shepherdess,\" the \"Nest,\"\n\n\nand the \"Shepherd and Shepherdesses.\" Of the many famous Venus-pieces\nthat his hand painted during these years it is not easy to write the\nlist. But having signed the \"Marriage of Love and Psyche\" at\nforty-one, he turned his experimental hand to the homely, realistic\nDutch style that was having a wide vogue, and painted the\n\"Dejeuner\"--a family of the prosperous class of the day at\nbreakfast--showing with rare charm the surroundings and home life of\nthe well-to-do of his time.\n\nAll goes well with Boucher. He changes into better quarters in the Rue\nde Grenelle-Saint-Honor\u00e9, where he lived for the next five years,\nuntil 1749; but his eyes are fixed upon a studio and apartments at\nthe old palace of the Louvre, though the hard intriguing of his\npowerful friends at Court on his behalf failed for some time. He had,\nindeed, to make another move before he arrived at his longed-for goal.\n\nPensions Boucher, like others, had found to be somewhat empty affairs;\nbut rooms at the Louvre were a solid possession eagerly sought after\nby the artists.\n\nIn this year of 1744 Boucher created a new fashion at the annual Salon\nby sending studies and sketches instead of finished pictures; and it\nset a value upon such things not before realised by artists, for\nsuccess was instant and loud.\n\nTowards the end of the next, Boucher's forty-second year, the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who was to take his leave of Paris,\ncommissioned four pictures to represent the day of a woman of fashion,\nand to be entitled \"Morning,\" \"Midday,\" \"Evening,\" and \"Night.\"\n\nBoucher painted one of these for him, now known as the \"Marchande de\nModes.\" The others were painted later, and all had a wide vogue as\nengravings. The correspondence has interest since it reveals Boucher's\nbusiness habits; he was paid for a picture on its delivery, and for\neach of these he was to receive 600 livres (double florins or\ndollars)--about a hundred and twenty pounds.\n\nIn an official document of the Director of Buildings to the king (or\nMinister of Fine Art, as we should say), written in this year of 1745,\nBoucher being forty-two, is a \"list of the best painters,\" in which\nBoucher is singled out for distinction as \"an historic painter, living\nin the Rue de Grenelle-Saint-Honor\u00e9, opposite the Rue des Deux-Ecus,\npupil of Lemoyne, excelling also in landscape, grotesques, and\nornaments in the manner of Watteau; and equally skilled in painting\nflowers, fruit, architecture, and subjects of gallantry and of\nfashion.\"\n\nNot so bad for dry officialdom; the critics could learn a lesson. For\nhe was nothing less. What indeed does he not do? and wondrous well!\nthis painter of the age.\n\nAnd the mighty rush of events is about to sweep him into further\nprominence; the very things which he probably passed by with a gay\nshrug are to enrich him, to help him to his highest fulfilment.\n\nPoor Ch\u00e2teauroux saw that she must lose the king's gadding favour in\nthe conflict with Maurepas unless she joined her lord, now with the\narmy. She realised full well that she had created the new Louis of\nAmbition--that her going must bring the people's hate to her. But she\ndared not lose the king. And she went. Maurepas had overdone his\njibings. The indiscretion at once rang through the land; became the\njest of the army--and Maurepas was not far from the bottom of the\nbusiness. The discreet indiscretion of covered ways between the king's\nlodgings and hers only added to the mockeries, and increased the\npeople's hate against, of course, the Ch\u00e2teauroux. Then upon a day in\nAugust the small-pox seized Louis at Metz; poor Ch\u00e2teauroux fought for\npossession of the king in the sick room, until his fear of\ndeath--Louis' sole piety--sent her packing--shrinking back in the\nhired carriage at each halting-place for change of horses, lest she\nshould be seen and torn from her place and destroyed by the populace.\n\nBut Louis recovered; Paris rang with bells at joy on his recovery, and\nhe entered the city amidst mad enthusiasm, hailed as The Well-Beloved.\n\nHe sent for the Ch\u00e2teauroux to find her dying, Maurepas having to\ndeliver the message of recall. She died suddenly and in great agony,\nswearing that Maurepas had poisoned her--died in the arms of her poor\ndiscarded sister, the De Mailly.\n\nBut this year of 1745 Boucher hears a mightier scandal that is to mean\nvast things to all France--and not least of all to Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE POMPADOUR\n\n\nA young bride had become the gossip of the rich merchant society of\nParis--that class that was ousting the old noblesse from power. She\nwas a beautiful, a remarkable woman; her wit was repeated in the\ndrawing-rooms, she had all the accomplishments; her charming\nname--Madame Lenormant d'Etioles.\n\nDraw aside the curtains of the past and we discover our little Jeanne\nPoisson--grown into this exquisite creature. It has come about in\nstrange fashion enough. The father--a scandalous fellow--having\nfingered the commissariat moneys in ugly ways to his own use, had been\nbanished for the ugly business. Nor is Jeanne's mother any better than\nshe should be; and the wags wink knowingly at the handsome and rich\nman of fashion, Monsieur Lenormant de Tournehem, who has been the\nfavoured gallant during the absence of the light-fingered Poisson.\n\nAnd, of a truth, Lenormant de Tournehem takes astonishing interest in\nthe little Jeanne--watching over her up-growing and giving her the\nbest of education at the convent, where she wins all hearts, and is\nknown as \"the little queen.\" The truth spoken with wondrous prophecy,\nif unthinkingly, as we shall see. Complacent Poisson came home, and\ntook the rich and fashionable, bland and smiling Lenormant de\nTournehem to his arms. Has he not wealth and estates? therefore as\nexcellent a friend for Poisson as for Madame Poisson. The girl Jeanne\nleaves the convent to be taught the accomplishments by the supreme\nmasters of France, the wits foregather at Madame Poisson's, and the\nbrilliant Jeanne is soon mistress of the arts--coquetry not least of\nall; has also the most exquisite taste in dress. Under all is a heart\ncold as steel; calculating as the higher mathematics. She has but one\nhindrance to ambition--her mean birth. Lenormant de Tournehem rids her\neven of this slur by making his nephew, Lenormant d'Etioles, marry\nher, giving the young couple half his fortune for dowry, and the\npromise of the rest when he dies--also he grants him a splendid\ntown-house, as splendid a country seat. And consequential\nself-respecting little Lenormant d'Etioles is lord of Etioles, amongst\nother seignories. So Jane Fish appears as Madame Lenormant d'Etioles,\nseductive, beautiful, accomplished, to whose house repair the new\nphilosophy, the wits, and artists. She has a certain sense of virtue;\nindeed openly vows that no one but the king shall ever come between\nher and her lord. But, deep in her heart, she has harboured a fierce\nambition--that the king shall help her to keep her bond. She puts\nforth all her gifts, all her powers, to win to the strange goal;\nconfides it to her worldly mother and \"uncle,\" Lenormant de Tournehem;\nfinds keen allies therein to the reaching of that strange goal. The\ndeath of the Ch\u00e2teauroux clears the way. At a masked ball the king is\nintrigued as to the personality of a beautiful woman who plagues him\nwith her art; he orders the unmasking. Madame Lenormant d'Etioles\nstands revealed, drops her handkerchief as by accident; the whisper\nruns through the Court that \"the handkerchief has been thrown!\" The\nking stoops and picks it up. A few evenings later she is smuggled into\nthe \"private apartments.\" She goes again a month later; in the morning\nis seized with sudden terror--she daren't go back to her angry lord\nlest he do her grievous harm; he will have missed her. The king is\ntouched; allows her to hide from henceforth in the secret apartments;\npromises the beautiful creature a lodging, her husband's banishment,\nand early acknowledgment as titular mistress--before the whole Court\nat Easter, says the pious Great One. But he has to join the army to\nplay the Conqueror at Fontenoy; and it is later in the year\n(September) before Madame d'Etioles is presented to the Court in a\nvast company and proceeds to the queen's apartments to kiss hands on\nappointment. Thus was Jeanne Poisson raised to the great aristocracy\nof France in her twenty-third year as Marquise de Pompadour.\n\nBoucher had been one of the brilliant group of artists of the\nd'Etioles' circle. That the Pompadour's influence had much effect upon\nhis position at Court for a year or two is unlikely; for she had to\nfight for possession of the king day and night, as the Ch\u00e2teauroux\nhad done, against the queen's party and the unscrupulous enmity of\nMaurepas. To set down Boucher's favour at Court to her is ridiculous.\n\nHe was painting for the queen's apartments at thirty-one when the\nPompadour was a school-girl of twelve. But in the year following her\nrise to power, Boucher painted four pictures for the large room of the\nDauphin, which were \"placed elsewhere\"; and, the year after that, he\nwas at work upon two pictures for the bedroom of the king at the\ncastle of Marly. It is likely enough that the Pompadour directed this\norder. She had almost immediately secured the office of the\nDirector-General of Buildings, which covered the direction of the\nroyal art treasures, for \"uncle\" Lenormant de Tournehem, who was also\na friend of the artist. And from this year it is significant that\nBoucher paints no more for the opposing camp of the Queen and Dauphin.\n\nHe was now giving all his strength to the \"Rape of Europa\" that he\npainted for the competition ordered by the Academy at the command of\nLenormant de Tournehem in the king's name, in which ten chosen\nAcademicians were to paint subjects in their own style for six prizes\nand a gold medal, to be awarded in secret vote by the competing\nartists themselves. Boucher won, by his amiable nature, the good-will\nof them all by proposing that they should so arrange as to share the\nprizes equally, and thus prevent any sense of soreness inevitable in\nthe losers.\n\nBut greatly as he won the good-fellowship of his fellow-artists by it,\nthis picture caused a murmur to rise amongst the critics who,\naforetime loud in his praise, now began to complain of his \"abuse of\nrose tints\" in the painting of the female nude. The fact was that\nDiderot and the men of the New Philosophy were turning their eyes to\nthe whole foundations upon which France was built, art as well as\nsociety, and were beginning to demand of art \"grandeur and morality in\nits subjects.\" They were soon to be clamouring for \"the statement of a\ngreat maxim, a lesson for the spectator.\" Diderot, with bull-like\ncourage, picked out the greatest, and turned upon Boucher, blaming him\nfor triviality.\n\nThe nations, weary of war, concluded the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in\nthe October of 1748. No sooner was peace concluded than Louis\nrelapsed into his old habit of dandified indolence and profligate\nease; and, putting from him his duties as the lord of a great people,\nhe gave himself up to shameless intrigues. He allowed the Pompadour to\nusurp his magnificence and to rule over the land. He yielded himself\nutterly, if sometimes sulkily, to her domination; and for sixteen\nyears she was the most powerful person at Court, the greatest force in\nthe state--making and unmaking ministers, disposing of office,\nhonours, titles, pensions. All political affairs were discussed and\narranged under her guidance; ministers, ambassadors, generals\ntransacted their business in her stately boudoirs; the whole patronage\nof the sovereign was dispensed by her pretty hands; the prizes of the\nChurch, of the army, of the magistracy could be obtained solely\nthrough her favour and good-will. Her energy must have been\nprodigious. Possessed of extraordinary talents and exquisite tastes,\nshe gave full rein to them, and it was in the indulgence of her better\nqualities that Destiny brought Boucher into the friendship of this\nwonderful woman. She became not only his patron but his pupil,\nengraving several of his designs.\n\nBut this, her sovereignty over the king, easy and light in its outward\nseeming, was a haggard nightmare to the calculating woman who had so\nlonged for it. She knew no single hour's rest from the night she won\nto the king's bed. She had to fight her enemies, secret and open, for\npossession of the king's will, day and night; and she fought--with\nrare courage. She won by consummate skill and unending pluck. She made\nherself an essential part of the king's freedom from care. The Court\nparty fought her for power with constant vigilance. Maurepas brought\nall his unscrupulous art, all his ironic mimicry, all his vile jibes\nand unchivalrous hatred to bear against her. He had made himself a\nnecessity to the king; and he never slept away a chance of injuring\nher. He knew no mercy, no nobility, no pity. He made her the detested\nobject of the people. With his own hands he penned the witty verses\nand epigrams that were sung and flung about the streets of Paris.\n\nBut she had an enemy more subtle than any at the Court--hour by hour\nshe had to dispute the king with the king's boredom. And it was in the\neffort to do so that she created her celebrated theatre in the\nprivate apartments, calling Boucher and others to her aid in the doing\nof it. Here the noblest of France vied with each other to obtain the\nsmallest part to play, an instrument in its orchestra, an invitation\nto its performances.\n\nBoucher left the Opera to become its decorator in 1748, and did not\nreturn until her death. For her, he also decorated her beautiful rooms\nat Bellevue. She bought at high prices many of his greatest\nmasterpieces.\n\nThe Pompadour's power so greatly increased that she openly took\ncommand of the king's will; dared and succeeded in getting his\nfavourite Maurepas banished; and herself took to the use of the kingly\n\"we.\" Her rascally father was created Lord of Marigny; her brother,\nwhom the king liked well and called \"little brother,\" was created\nMarquis de Vandi\u00e8res; her only child, Alexandrine, signed her name as\na princess of the blood royal, and would have been married to the\nblood royal had she not caught the small-pox and died. She amassed a\nprivate fortune, castles, and estates such as no mistress had dreamed\nof; and into them she poured art treasures that cost the nation\nthirty-six millions of money. She created the porcelain factory of\nS\u00e8vres, kept keen watch over the Gobelins looms, and founded the great\nMilitary School of St. Cyr amidst work that would have kept several\nstatesmen busy, and of deadly intrigues at Court that would have\nbroken the spirit of many a brilliant man.\n\nIt was in her hectic desire to keep the king from being bored that she\nstooped, and made Boucher stoop, to the employment of his high\nartistry in the painting of a series of indecent pictures wherewith to\ntickle the jaded desires of Boredom, and thereby gave rise to the\nwidespread impression that Boucher's art was ever infected by base\ndesign. But Boucher was, at his very worst, but a healthy animal; and\neven in these secret works for the king he did not reach so low as did\nmany an artist of more pious memory who painted with no excuse but his\nown pleasure.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the Pompadour has been blamed too much for this\nevil act, and too much forgotten for her splendid patronage of the man\nwho, under it and during these great years of his forties, produced a\nseries of masterpieces that place him in the foremost rank of the\npainters of his century. It is impossible to reckon the number of the\npastorals and Venus-pieces that his master-hand painted and loved to\npaint, during these the supreme years of his genius. It is significant\nthat they were painted during the years that saw the Pompadour in\nsupreme power.\n\nBoucher was so firmly established in 1750, his forty-seventh year,\nthat he moved into a new house in the Rue Richelieu, near the Palais\nRoyal. Disappointed in not receiving a studio and apartments at the\nLouvre, he was allowed to use a studio in the king's library. He was\nnow making money so easily that he was able to collect pictures and\nprecious stones and the gaily coloured curiosities that appealed to\nhis tastes.\n\nThe critics were becoming more and more censorious; and one of them\nhits true with the comment that in his pastorals his shepherdesses\nlook as if they had stepped over from the Opera and would soon be off\nagain thereto.\n\nIn his forty-eighth year Boucher's art was at its most luminous\nstage--his atmosphere clear and subtle and exquisitely rendered; his\nyellows golden; his whites satin-like and silvery; his flesh-tones\nupon the nude bodies of his goddesses unsurpassed by previous art. The\nbeauty of it all was not to last much longer.\n\nLenormant de Tournehem died suddenly in the November of 1751; the\nPompadour's brother, Abel Poisson de Vandi\u00e8res, was appointed\nDirector-General in his stead at the age of twenty-five--and soon\nafterwards, on the death of his father, created Marquis de Marigny--a\nshy, handsome youth, a gentleman and an honourable fellow, whom the\nking liked well, and against whom his sister's sole complaint was that\nhe lacked the brazen effrontery of the courtiers of the day. No man\ndid more for the advancement of the art of his time. A pension of a\nthousand livres falling vacant, the young fellow secured it for\nBoucher; and almost immediately afterwards, a studio becoming vacant\nat the Louvre owing to the death of Coypel, first painter to the king,\nBoucher came to his coveted home, eagerly moving in with his family as\nsoon as its wretched state could be put into repair.\n\nThe decoration of the new wing to the palace at Fontainebleau brought\nthe commission for the painting of the ceiling and the principal\npicture in the Council Chamber to Boucher, who had already decorated\nthe Dining-Room. This was the period of his painting the \"Rising\" and\nthe \"Setting of the Sun\" for the Pompadour, now in the Watteau\ncollection, two canvases that were always favourites with the painter,\nbitterly as they were assailed by the critic Grimm.\n\nHe was turning out so much work that it was impossible to give as much\ncare to his pictures as he ought. For he refused sternly, his life\nlong, to raise his prices; by consequence he had to create a larger\namount of work in order to meet his expenditure. It was about this\ntime that Reynolds, passing through Paris, went to visit him and found\nhim painting on a huge canvas without models or sketches. \"On\nexpressing my surprise,\" writes Reynolds, \"he replied that he had\nconsidered the model as necessary during his youth until he had\ncompleted his study of art, but that he had not used one for a long\ntime past.\"\n\nHe soon had not the time, not only to paint from nature but even to\ngive his pictures the work necessary to complete them. The feverish\nhaste which took possession of him in his frantic endeavour to meet\nthe vast demand for his pictures, and the eager efforts of his\nengravers to satisfy the public call for engravings after his works,\ngave him less and less leisure to joy in their doing. And his eyesight\nbegan to fail. His flesh-tints deepened to a reddish hue; and he\nstands baffled before his work, suspecting his sight, since what every\none cries out upon as being bright vermilion, he only sees as a dull\nearthy colour. Boucher has topped the height of his achievement; he\nhas to \"descend the other side of the hill.\" Boucher begins to grow\nold.\n\nIn Boucher's fifty-first year an ugly intrigue of the queen's party at\nCourt to sap the Pompadour's influence over the king by drawing away\nthe king's affections towards Madame de Choiseul-Romanet, a reckless\nyoung beauty of the Court, brought about a strange alliance. The Count\nde Stainville, one of the Pompadour's bitterest enemies, was shown the\nking's letter of invitation to his young kinswoman; and he, deeply\nwounded in his pride that his kinswoman should have been offered to\nthe king, went to the Pompadour and exposed the plot. A close\nalliance followed; and De Stainville thenceforth became her chief\nguide in affairs of state. It was at her instance that the king called\nhim to be his Prime Minister, raising him to the Duchy of Choiseul--a\nname he made illustrious as one of the greatest Ministers of France.\n\nIn his fifty-second year Boucher was appointed to the directorship of\nthe Gobelins looms, to the huge delight of the weavers and all\nconcerned with the tapestry factory. This was the year of his painting\nthe famous portrait of the Pompadour, to whom he several times paid\nthis \"tribute of immorality.\" For the Gobelins looms he produced many\nhandsome designs; and he was painting with astounding industry. But\nhis hand's skill began to falter. His art shows weariness in his\nsixtieth year, and sickness fell upon him, and held him in servitude\nnow with rare moments of respite. The critics, notoriously Diderot,\nwere now attacking him with shameless virulence. Boucher passed it all\nby; but he felt the change that was taking place in the public taste.\n\nThe ideas of the New Philosophy were infecting public opinion; the Man\nof Feeling had arisen in the land; and France, humiliated in war, and\nresenting the follies and the greed of her shameless privileged class,\nwas openly resenting it and all its works. Choiseul had planted his\nstrength deep in the people's party, and was come near to being its\ngod. His masterly mind had checked Frederick of Prussia to the North;\nand the nations, exhausted by the struggle, signed the Peace of Paris\nin 1763. Choiseul, with France at peace abroad, turned to the blotting\nout of the turbulent order of the Jesuits at home. Their attempt to\nend the Pompadour's relations with the king made this powerful woman\neager to complete his design; the chance was soon to come, and the\nOrder was abolished from France and its vast property seized by the\nstate.\n\nThe Pompadour lived but a short while to enjoy her triumph. Worn out\nby her superhuman activities, assailed by debt, she fell ill of a\nracking cough, dying on the 15th of April, 1764, in her forty-second\nyear, keeping her ascendancy over the king and the supreme power in\nFrance to her last hour. Death found her transacting affairs of state.\n\nLouis, weary of his servitude, had only a heartless epigram to cast\nat the body of the dead woman as she passed to her last resting-place.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE END\n\n\nThe death of the Pompadour robbed Boucher of a friend; but her\nbrother, Marigny, remained faithfully attached to the old artist, and\nseized every chance to honour him. On the death of Carle van Loo,\nBoucher, at sixty-two, was made first painter to the king, with all\nhis pensions and privileges that were consistent with this the supreme\nappointment in the art world.\n\nThere had been serious intention of making Boucher the head of the\nEcole des El\u00e8ves Proteg\u00e9s; he had the art of making himself liked and\nof inspiring the love of the arts. He was very popular with the\nstudents and artists, owing to his kindliness, his eagerness to render\nservice, his readiness to encourage the youngsters or to console them.\n\nWhen the riot took place, provoked by the Academicians by their award\nof the Prix de Rome in 1767, the students insulted the Academicians,\nbut hailed Boucher with enthusiastic applause. The reason was not far\nto seek. When a student came to the old master for advice he did not\n\"play the pontiff,\" and, scorning the false dignity of big phrases, he\ntook the brush in his hand and showed the way out of all difficulties\nby simplehearted example, despising rules, and putting himself out in\norder to make things clear to a young artist.\n\nHowever, the Academicians feared he would be an unorthodox master for\nyouth, and appointed another in his place.\n\nA long and serious illness thwarted his keen energies. Diderot was\ngiving himself up to outrageous violence against him. If the old\npainter exhibited at the Salon, Diderot fiercely assailed his art; if\nhe did not exhibit, Diderot as bitterly assailed him for his\nnegligences. Above all, he attacked Boucher in that he did not paint\nwhat Diderot would have painted--but could not. \"When he paints\ninfants,\" cries Diderot, \"you will not find one employed in a real act\nof life--studying his lesson, reading, writing, stripping hemp.\"\n\nPoor unfortunate infants! for whom Philosophy could find no happier\njoy in life than stripping hemp! Boucher was but an artist. He\npainted his generation as far as he could see it, and, with all his\nfaults and weaknesses, he never debauched his art with foreign and\nalien things that had no part in the nation's life; he painted fair\nFrance into his landscapes, not a make-believe land he did not know\nwith preposterous Greek ruins; and best of all, to his eternal honour,\nhe painted infants glad in their gladness to be alive, with no desire\nto send their happy little bodies to school, with no sickly ambition\nto make them into budding philosophers, with no thought of making them\npose and lie as Men of Feeling. He had no joy in setting their little\nbodies to toil--in making them \"teach a lesson to the spectator,\" in\nmaking them stoop their little shoulders to the \"picking of hemp.\"\n\nHe continued to paint as he had always painted--except that he painted\nless well. The wreath of roses was wilting on a grey head. The blood\njigged less warmly in the frail body. The features showed pallid--the\neyes haggard. The sight failed. The hand alone kept something of its\ncunning.\n\nHe went to Holland with his friend Randon du Boisset, but health\nshrank farther from him. Diderot had near spent his last jibe.\n\nIn 1768, Boucher's sixty-fifth year, the neglected queen went to her\ngrave. The king's grief and contrition and vows to amend his life came\ntoo late, and lasted little longer than the drying of the floods of\ntears over the body of his dead consort. A year later he was become\nthe creature of a pretty woman of the gutters, whom he caused to be\nmarried to the Count du Barry--the infamously famous Madame du Barry.\n\nBut neither the remonstrances of Choiseul with the king against this\nfurther degradation of the throne of France, nor his unconcealed scorn\nof the upstart countess, nor the dangerous enemy he made for himself\nthereby, signified now to Boucher, first painter to the king.\n\nBoucher was failing. His son was a prig and a disappointment. His two\nfavourite pupils, Baudoin and Deshayes, who had married his two girls,\ndied.\n\nTo the Salon of 1769 he sent his \"Caravan of Bohemians.\" It was his\nlast display. He had been going about for some time like a gaunt ghost\nof his former self, afflicted with all the ills inevitable to a life\nfeverishly consumed in work and the pursuit of pleasure.\n\nThey went to his studio at five of the clock one May morning, and\nfound him seated at his easel, before a canvas of Venus, dead, with\nthe paint-filled brush fallen out of his fingers.\n\nSo passed he away on the 30th of May 1770, in his sixty-seventh year.\n\nWhen Boucher died, the generation of which he was the limner was near\ncome to its violent end. The rosy carnivals and gay gallantries of his\nage gave way to the blood-stained romance and fierce tempest of the\nRevolution. The garrets of the old curiosity-shops received the\ndiscarded canvases of the master. His shepherds and shepherdesses were\nput to rout by the Romans of his pupil, citizen David. The old order\nwas brought into contempt and overthrown. And with it, Boucher's art,\nlike much that was gracious and charming and good in the evil thing,\nwent down also, and was overwhelmed for a while.\n\nFor a while only. For just as, out of the blood and terror of the\nRevolution, a real France arose, phnix-wise, from the ruin, and in\nbeing born, whilst putting off the vilenesses of the thing from which\nshe sprang, took on also to herself the gracious and winsome qualities\nthat place her amongst the most fascinating peoples of the ages; so\nBoucher has come into his kingdom again--the most gracious of painters\nthat the years have yielded."

                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n        a. One bed, or folding cot,\n        b. One oil stove,\n        c. One lamp,\n        d. Enough supplies of all kinds sufficient for six months,\n        e. Pots, pans, kettles, etc.\nIt is needless to say that positions in Manila and Iloilo were now at\na premium.\n\nWas it possible that teachers were to be sent to places where even the\nnecessaries of life could not be obtained! Was it possible that many\nwould be sent to places so remote that for six months no fresh\nsupplies could be gotten! A mass meeting was held at once, and a\ncommittee was appointed to send a cablegram to the Associated Press\npetitioning aid from the American people at large. Realizing what\nconsternation would be created throughout the United States by such a\nmessage, two of the teachers leaped into a carriage at the close of\nthe meeting and a few moments later were closeted with the chief\nexecutive of the department. As a result the committee was persuaded\nnot to send the cablegram to the Associated Press until by courtesy it\nhad been sent to the President. Of course, this diplomatic move tided\naffairs over and the teachers who had flatly refused to budge from\nManila now agreed to go on to their stations, being assured that\nwhatever action was best would be taken.\n\nThe day had come when we must separate. We were to enter an untried\nand an unknown field. It was fitting that we have a final joyous\nmeeting, so the best orchestra in the archipelago was engaged and we\n\"chased the hours with flying feet\" until dawn so that whatever might\ncome to us in that unknown future upon which we were entering each\nwould hold in pleasant memory our last evening together.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER III. - A DRAMA IN ACTUAL LIFE.\n\n\nAlmost every one heeded the warning to go to his station forearmed\nwith at least necessaries of life, but, as it had never fallen to the\nlot of the writer to cook, he refused to learn at that late day, so he\ntook no pot, no pan, no kettle, putting his future into the hands of\nan uncertain fate and relying upon the unknown hospitality of the\nFilipino.\n\nBacalod, the capital of the province of Occidental Negros, was our\ndestination. The second morning after leaving Manila, we awoke with\nthe \"Kilpatrick\" lying at anchor in a shallow bay. We were several\nmiles from the shore and nothing in sight indicated that we had\nreached a place of any importance. Late the night before we had been\nawakened by the loud, sharp ringing of the ship's bells, accompanied\nby the reversal of the engines and a general disturbance awaking the\ncrew. So our first impressions on coming on deck were that we had run\naground. But the captain assured us that everything was ship-shape and\nthat this was the nearest point of approach to Capiz, a town of\nconsiderable importance on the island of Panay, where a body of troops\nwas to embark for home. Not even the grass hut of a native was in\nsight. Search as we would, not a sign was seen of a stream flowing\ninto the sea, indicating the probable presence of a town. There was\nnot a sign of life of any kind save one lone column of thin, blue\nsmoke that arose from the side of a mountain miles away. One would\nhave thought that we were explorers of three hundred years ago lying\noff the shore of some unknown land.\n\nAfter breakfast the steam launch, together with all the boats, was\nlowered, and several of us who had determined to miss no opportunity\nto gather information about the islands took our places in the launch\nby the side of the ship's mate, and steamed away across the water with\na long line of boats strung out in the rear. We headed away toward a\ngroup of cocoanut trees, and about an hour later stepped ashore on a\npile of decayed coral rocks that extended some twenty or thirty feet\nout into the water, thus forming the only landing place of a town of\nseveral thousands of people and of considerable commercial importance.\n\nA few moments after we had landed, an army wagon drawn by a\nmagnificent pair of mules came up out of a tropical jungle along a\nnarrow road. We clambered into the wagon and were soon lost in the\ndepths of foliage from which we had just seen the vehicle emerge.\n\nLong waving bamboos with their plumy leafage hung over the road from\neach side, meeting and overlapping in the center until they formed an\narchway so dense that the tropical sun now high in the heavens\npenetrated it only at intervals. At times the wagon sank up to the\nhubs in the soft earth, and the muscles of the mules stood out like\nwhip-cords under the skin as they drew us forward.\n\nAt a sharp turn in the road we came upon the first division of troops\nthat was to embark for home. The look of joy upon their sun-browned\nfaces was inexpressible. Their work was done, and with elastic step\nand smiling faces they saluted us as they passed by. The reign of\nforce was at an end; it was going out with them; the reign of peace\nhad begun; it was coming in with us.\n\nIn the afternoon when we returned from the town the last of the troops\nhad arrived and, as we drove up, the bugle was sounding the call to\nsupper. We noticed native women mingling with the troops and, indeed,\na native woman was in constant attention waiting upon one of the\nsoldiers with whom we ate. Her clothes were clean, her hair was nicely\ncombed, and her general appearance was neat. She seemed to anticipate\nthe slightest wish of the soldier with whom she was. She brought him\nwater to drink, cleaned his plate after the meal and saw that his\nknife, fork, and spoon were put into his haversack.\n\nWe had now finished supper and the launch had returned for the last\nload of troops. The lieutenant in command of the company gave the\norder to \"fall in\"; the men shouldered their rifles and fell into\nline. \"Forward, march!\" called the lieutenant, and the column swept\nforward towards the boats. The women had until now restrained\nthemselves, but, as their husbands marched away never to return, their\nfeelings could no longer be restrained. One young woman of about\neighteen, who was leaning against a rock by the roadside sobbing, when\nher husband passed, leaped up in frenzy of passionate love and caught\nthe rifle from his shoulder. Her first impulse seemed to be to throw\nthe gun away, but suddenly realizing the futility of such an act she\nburst into tears, shouldered the rifle herself and marched on by his\nside. Another woman of more mature age threw her arms around the legs\nof a tall stalwart man, and drew him bodily from the line.\n\nBut the troops marched on and entered the boats. One woman who had\nbeen unnoticed before came down into the shallow water and caught hold\nof our last boat as if to prevent its leaving, while others stood\nmingling their sobs with the sounds of the wavelets as they broke on\nthe sands. As we passed away, an expectant mother, standing in bold\noutline against the twilight sky, threw up her hands in an agony of\ndespair and then sank upon the stones. The curtain had fallen upon a\ndrama in actual life deeper in pathos than any other we had ever seen\nor ever expected to see. Depth of passion, depth of love! Who can\nfathom the human heart?\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. - WHAT THE TEACHERS DID.\n\n\nThere is a remarkable sameness about the towns in the Philippines.\n\nThey all have a large open square about the middle of the town, around\nthree sides of which are Chinese stores, unless one side lies open to\nthe sea, and on the fourth is the great stone ecclesia. The streets\nrun at right angles to one another and divide up the town into\ncreditable squares.\n\nEverybody in the Philippines lives up-stairs, for the ground is so\nsoaked with water during the rainy season that it is a menace to\nhealth to live upon the ground floor. So even the poorest nippa hut\nis built upon stakes four or five feet above the ground.\n\nBacalod is a typical Philippine town. As we landed, a broad open\nsquare was spread out before us. Two sides of the square were lined\nwith two-story houses in which were Chinese stores below and Filipino\nhomes above. On the third side stood the great stone church in whose\nmassive tower the clock was striking the hour of four, while the\nfourth lay open to the sea that had borne us thither.\n\nWe landed, but it was in a method new to us and one not usually\nemployed by the traveling public.\n\nWhen our sail boat ran aground on the sandy bottom a hundred yards or\nmore from the shore, a crowd of Filipino men who were on the beach\nslowly rolled up their pantaloons and waded out to the rescue,--for\nthe money that was in it. The boat's crew elevated their trousers'\nlegs also and slided down into the water. Each of us then straddled\nthe neck of a Filipino standing in the water and was held by ankles to\nbe steadied while our biped mounts proceeded to the shore.\n\nWe were now on the ground and face to face with the situation. To give\nthe reader an idea of the actual conditions met by the first teachers\nwho went to the Islands, the following is copied from the instructions\ngiven us in Manila:\n    1. There shall be two sessions daily of all schools, and the\n    last hour of the morning session shall be devoted solely to\n    instructing the Filipino teachers.\n\n    2. In cases where teachers are sent to a town in which there\n    is no school-house, they are expected to secure the aid of the\n    people and have one built.\n\n    3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is\n    stopped.\n\n    4. All supplies must be kept under lock and key. In towns\n    where there is no case or box to lock the supplies in, and it\n    is also impossible to get the town council to furnish a case,\n    a requisition may be sent to Manila, and, if an appropriation\n    can be secured, one will be made and sent out.\n\nThus it can be easily seen that we were indeed pioneers. In many\nplaces no school-house was to be found, and in some cases it was even\ndifficult to get the town council to provide a case in which to keep\nthe supplies.\n\nThe work of the teachers was, in short; to \"make the English language\nthe basis of instruction in the public schools.\" On our arrival at\nBacalod two schools were found in progress, for some soldiers had been\ndetailed for the work here previous to our coming. One of these was\nfor boys and the other, for girls. Thus the work here had been in a\nmeasure simplified, but complications that had arisen at Talisay, one\nof the largest and richest towns on the island, demanded a change of\nteachers and the writer was assigned to the place as superintendent.\n\nHere an attempt had been made to start a school but it had failed\nignominiously and a system of education was to be put into operation\nfrom the very start.\n\nThe Filipinos are not strong advocates of co-education, so separate\nschools were to be started for the boys and the girls. The one for the\nboys was gotten well in hand before the one for the girls was\nattempted at all.\n\nA few days after reaching the town and securing a home the\npresidente of the town had it publicly announced that the following\nMonday morning at eight o'clock a public school for boys would be\nopened in a building that had been rented for the purpose by the\nmunicipal council. About the middle of the afternoon of the same day a\nman beat a little drum throughout all the streets of the town to call\nthe people out and the town clerk announced both in Spanish and in the\nnative language that this public school would begin at the time and\nplace mentioned above; that instruction would be free to all who came;\nthat the government would furnish all supplies; and that instruction\nwould be given in the English language. A native principal and\nassistants were employed and everything was ready to begin.\n\nThe official report of the result is as follows:\n    Boys' public school of Talisay, Negros, P. I., began November\n    4, 1901. Forty-three boys present at eight o'clock. Forty-one\n    of them knew \"good morning\" and \"good afternoon\" but do not\n    know the distinction between them. Two of them speak simple\n    Spanish. At eight forty-five, eight more, who had been\n    attending an early morning private school, came in together.\n\n    The books they brought were so varied and so different from\n    one another that it seemed impossible to bring any reasonable\n    degree of order out of such a chaos, and so, after struggling\n    vainly for about a week with the problem, the superintendent\n    by one fell stroke removed everything in use and put in a\n    uniform system, and from that day on the English language has\n    been the basis of instruction in the public schools of\n    Talisay. The work was of necessity very slow at first, but by\n    the end of a year two schools were going nicely and a number\n    of the brightest boys and girls had made really excellent\n    progress.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER V. - A \"BAILE.\"\n\n\nNot long after the arrival of our party at Bacalod we received an\ninvitation to a \"baile\" given in our honor by the inhabitants of\nSilay, a town some ten or twelve miles up the northern coast and one\nnoted for its social life. The invitation was accepted with pleasure,\nand about the middle of the afternoon on the day appointed we were\nclad in the immaculate white of the tropics and steaming away up the\ncoast on board a launch sent for our conveyance. Twilight was still\nlingering on the path of day when we anchored just off shore at the\ntown. A row-boat containing the officials of the city came out to meet\nus and, in due season, we were ushered into a spacious drawing-room\nfilled almost to overflowing with the \u00e9lite of the town. The \u00e9lite of\ntowns in the Philippines speak Spanish, and, as only one or two of our\nparty could at that time boast of more than a formal acquaintance with\nthe Castilian tongue, the exchange of ideas that evening between us\nand the Filipinos was of necessity not very rapid.\n\nThe necessity of easy communication between us was rendered somewhat\nless indispensable by the announcement of supper as soon as we were\nrested from our trip. When we had taken our places at the table a\nyoung Filipino about twenty-five years of age arose and gave a lengthy\ntoast to the recent union of the Philippines with the United States.\n\nBut as we Americans were unable to scale the dizzy heights of his\nclimaxes or sink to the depths of his pathos, we forewent the\npleasures of his oratory and turned our attention to the savory odor\nof lamb, chicken, and roast pig that came slyly stealing up our\nnostrils to send us nerve dispatches about the gastronomic delights of\nour not far distant future.\n\nAt last the toast was ended and the world-wide soup ushered in a long\ntrain of things good to eat, served in a style better fitted to the\ndelights of the appetite than to the formalities of dinners, for, as\nsoon as the pleasant task of one dish was completed by any one, the\nnext was served him at once regardless of the progress made by the\nothers at the table.\n\nThe last course was dulce. The new-comers to the Philippines will\nnot be long in making the acquaintance of this dish, and at all\nmeetings, both public and private, where eatables are served, it\nperforms an important part. It is anything sweet, and it may vary all\nthe way from an india-rubber-like black mixture of cocoanut milk and\ndirty sugar to a really toothsome and respectable confection. No\nmatter of what materials a dish is composed, just so long as it is\nsweet, it is dulce.\n\nAfter paying our respects to this last course, we arose from the table\nand entered a great rectangular room from the center of whose ceiling\nhung a large glass chandelier, a mass of shimmering crystals. In the\nchairs around the room were the wealth, the youth, and the beauty of\nthe town.\n\nThe first and also the last number of every Filipino dance of any\nformality is the \"rigodon.\" The dancers are arranged in a square, or\nquadrangle according to the number participating, and are then led\nthrough a tangled maze of figures that so utterly bewilders the novice\nthat he sinks into his chair at the end of the dance wondering how it\nall came to pass.\n\nWe Americans breathed a sigh of relief when the \"rigodon\" ended, and\nmustered fresh courage for social conquests in the waltz that was now\nbreathing forth from the trembling strings. My companion in the first\ndance had been the young lady by whose side I had sat at dinner. But\nit now became necessary to search for another, so I prudently waited\nto see how partners were chosen, and made no mistake when a few\nmoments later I faced one of the most luscious looking se\u00f1oritas on\nthe opposite side of the room and offered her my arm. My eyes must\nhave told the story that my lips could not utter in Spanish, for she\nsmiled upon me sweetly, arose, and put her hand upon my shoulder. My\narm encircled her waist and I began to waltz. Unfortunately my\ncompanion did not follow, but began to hop up and down in a manner\nmost distressing. Supposing the attack to be only temporary, I paused\nand, much to my relief, she soon showed signs of recovery; and in the\ncourse of time she came to a standstill looking up into my face in an\ninquiring sort of way, apparently wondering why St. Vitus had not paid\nhis respects to me also. A second attempt to follow the music met with\nresults similar to the first, and during the third attempt, which\nseemed to be trembling on the verge of a failure, St. Vitus let go my\ncompanion and seized me with such vigor that she, who was small even\nfor a Filipino, was gathered up bodily and taken around the room at\nsuch a pace that her toes touched the floor only at far distant\nintervals.\n\nAt this point my devotion to the shrine of Terpsichore ceased from\nforce of circumstances and I seated myself in one of the most\ncomfortable chairs in sight that I might carry out a previously formed\nplan to study the Filipino somewhat critically as he appears in\nsociety.\n\nThe first thing that impressed me as the dancers passed up and down\nthe room was the flash of diamonds. Nearly every woman in the room had\non a brooch that flashed the colors of the rainbow at every turn.\n\nAlmost all of them wore one or more rings that showed up brilliantly\nunder the chandelier. Many of the men too, especially the young men,\nwore gems that appeared to be exquisite. A closer inspection showed\nthat some of the gems had flaws and others were of a poor color, but\nno one would have denied that, taken as a whole, it was a really\nbeautiful display.\n\nThe dress of the ladies was richly colored. Many of their skirts were\nof silk covered with hand embroidered flowers, and their filmy pina\nwaists and broad collar pieces were rich with needle-work. They all\nwore a kind of heelless velvet slipper, very common as a dress shoe in\nthe Philippines, or high-heeled patent leather shoes with neatly\nfitting black stockings.\n\nThe men were dressed in white coats and white pantaloons or black\ncoats and white pantaloons. White shirts and collars, together with\nall sorts and styles of cravats and low-cut patent leather shoes with\nhighly colored socks completed their dress.\n\nIt was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money;\nthat they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a\ntable loaded with good things was a fact to which all of us were\nenthusiastic witnesses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VI. - A SKETCH OF LIFE IN THE PHILIPPINES.\n\n\nHouse-keeping in the Philippines presents some interesting phases. Our\nclub of American officials decided to run a mess, so we employed a\ncook and a house boy, then each of us provided himself with a personal\nservant, making a total of six servants for four men--it takes about\nthis proportion of servants to live in any sort of comfort in the\nPhilippines--and launched ourselves boldly upon the sea of domestic\neconomy. But there were shoals ahead of us, for the question of\nregulating servants is one of no small importance in the Philippines,\nand one of its most disadvantageous features is the long chain of\ndependents that usually attends it.\n\nWe gave the cooks so much a day with which to buy supplies in the\nlocal market, for our own table, making him render a daily list of\nexpenditures, and a fixed amount besides to purchase rice and fish for\nhimself and the other servants. Of course, if they wished to vary\ntheir diet and get chicken and fresh pork, which could be had at far\ndistant intervals, it was wholly a matter of their option, but the\nallowance was made on the basis of so much rice and fish a day for\neach. This allowance was about fifteen cents a day in Spanish coin per\nservant.\n\nThus far all was well. We had agreed to give the cook eight dollars a\nmonth in Spanish money, thinking that good wages would procure good\nservice, but the visions of affluence that floated before him on such\nfloods of wealth were so alluring that they drew him from the kitchen\nto the cooler veranda. In less than a week he had employed an\nassistant at four dollars a month; in less than another week that\nassistant had employed him an assistant at two dollars a month; in\nless than another week that assistant to the assistant had employed\nhim an assistant at the princely salary of fifty cents a month; and\nfrom fear that the chain of dependents would end only by our having\nthe whole Filipino race attached to our culinary force, we broke up\nhouse-keeping and went boarding again, choosing that as the less of\nthe two evils.\n\nOur house furnishings were almost wholly Philippine. The table ware\nand the food on the table came from the ends of the earth. The knives\nand forks were made in Germany, the plates were manufactured in\nEngland, the glass ware and table cloth, in the United States. The\noatmeal and flour came from the United States also. The butter came\nfrom Australia, the rice from China, the salt from Russia, and the\nother eatables from sources about as various as their separate names.\n\nSwitzerland furnished the condensed milk and Illinois the canned\ncream. Nearly all of the canned fruit bore labels from Spain.\n\nThus it can easily be seen that life in the Philippines, if lived\naccording to American ideals, is dependent upon a highly developed and\nhighly complex commerce. However, the difficulties of transportation\nand the restriction of large stocks of merchandise to Manila and some\nhalf a dozen other towns, make so great a difference between country\nlife and city life that a short comparison of the two will not be out\nof place, and life in Manila may well be taken as being fairly typical\nof the latter.\n\nLife in Manila is pleasant, but expensive. It is pleasant from the\nfact that it is not only the capital but also metropolis of the\narchipelago. Thus the combination of wealth and high official position\nhas given to Manila a society of the highest and most refined type.\n\nThe process of beautifying and improving the city which is constantly\ngoing on bids fair to give us at no distant day a city of which we may\nwell be proud.\n\nBut let him who intends living well in Manila on a small income bid\nfarewell at once to so idylic a dream, for it costs much to live well\nthere. In the city of Manila one can get almost anything he wishes,\nbut it must be paid for at the price it commands. Especially in the\ncase of eatables, this price is by no means small, because to the\nfirst cost of articles must in most cases be added the expense of\ndistant shipment from American, European, or Australian ports, and not\ninfrequently the cost of long refrigeration must also be taken into\nconsideration. But, expensive though it is, it is very pleasant to\nlive there and those who have once enjoyed it often wish again to\nquaff the cup of its delights.\n\nIn strong contrast to this pleasant life is the life of the quiet\nlittle hamlet away in the distant islands. Indeed, the Filipino from\nthe distant town, who by some good fortune has been to Manila, or, by\na coup de main, has studied in one of the Manila colleges, is looked\nup to in a true hero-worshiping attitude by all who either know him or\nhear of his fame. Life in such a place is one long state of harmless\ninactivity. Not a wave of trouble from the great outer world ever\ndisturbs its peaceful repose. One lounges forever in an air of\nindolent ease and extreme aversion to anything approaching what might\nbe called a respectable effort.\n\nOne arises in the morning about the time the sun's first rays silver\nthe top leaves of the cocoanut trees and then stirs around until nine\nor ten o'clock, when it is found expedient to avoid a further exposure\nto the sun. From then until about five o'clock in the afternoon it is\nbest to take things as they come, even though one of those things be a\nFilipino dinner. But then you may have your vehiclo attached to a\nyoung bull with a ring in his nose and go for a drive. If it is the\ndry season you will probably enjoy the drive unless you object to the\nfrequent clouds of dust swept along by the evening wind. If it is in\nthe rainy season your pleasure will depend to a considerable extent\nupon how wet you get; but, whether the season be wet or dry, your\npleasure will be regulated largely by the state of harmony existing\nbetween the driver and the bull.\n\nIn these quiet secluded nooks successive generations of Filipinos are\nborn, reared, grow old and die in an even chain of events broken only\nby the occasional erection of a new grass house on the identical spot\nwhere its predecessors have stood for ages. The son lives in the house\nof his father, cultivates the same few square feet of soil planted in\nedible roots, climbs the same cocoanut trees, follows the same winding\npath down to the stream, pounds rice in the same mortar and with the\nsame stick that his ancestors have used from time unremembered, and,\nin case of illness, curls up on a grass mat in a corner of the room\nuntil he dies or by some good fortune recovers. Beyond this narrow\nhorizon he never looks. So narrow and contracted is the life that the\nlanguages of two towns a few miles apart are so different that one\nwould scarcely recognize them as belonging to the same race of people.\n\nSuch are the two extremes of life in our new far Eastern provinces:\nthe one is active, progressive, and cosmopolitan; the other, inactive,\ndecadent, and narrow; but, whether one enjoys the first or endures the\nsecond, there comes to him after leaving a longing to lounge again in\ntropic airs and listen to the lullaby of the winds among the palms.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VII. - THE FILIPINO AT HOME.\n\n\nAs one enters a Filipino sitting-room for the first time, there is one\nfeature in the arrangement of the furniture that impresses itself upon\nhim at once, and it may be stated without fear of serious\ncontradiction that this same peculiar feature in its arrangement will\ncontinue to face him, as he enters different homes, about as certainly\nas he crosses the threshold.\n\nThe arrangement referred to is that of one large mirror, one settee,\nand some ten or a dozen chairs that appear to have had a certain\norderly affection for one another. The mirror is hung upon one of the\nlarge interior parts of the house about four feet above the floor. The\nwooden houses in the Philippines are built by setting large posts\nupright into the ground, extending into the air from twenty to thirty\nfeet. Cross timbers are fastened to these upright posts about eight or\nten feet above the ground and then not sawed off even with the posts,\nbut allowed to extend beyond them each way. The framework of the house\nis built upon these extending cross timbers, a style of building by\nwhich these large upright posts are left standing out on the inside of\nthe room from one to three feet from the walls. It is on that one of\nthese posts most nearly opposite the door that the mirror always finds\nits place. Immediately beneath the mirror is the settee; and the\nchairs are arranged in two parallel lines facing one another and at\nright angles with the ends of the settee. However odd this arrangement\nmay appear to one when he first enters a Filipino drawing-room, there\nare two things to be said in its favor. In the first place, it places\nyou face to face with the person with whom you are conversing so that\nyou can watch him,--a matter of no small moment in the Philippines. In\nthe next place, it enables you to give one of the young ladies a\nsheep's-eye in the mirror while the others present are left where\nMoses was in our much abused conundrum.\n\nThe size of the residence and the quality of its furnishings depends\nupon the wealth of the owner. But there is so vast a difference\nbetween the mode of life of the highest class and the tao, or lowest\nclass, that it is well to speak of them separately, and the great\nmiddle class of Filipinos can easily be imagined to occupy the\nintervening ground.\n\nThe rich Filipino's house is usually of wood built upon a wall of\nstone or brick from ten to fifteen feet high. The floors are kept\nhighly polished in his hallway, dressing-room, and bed-rooms. There\nare, of course, no fire-places in any of the rooms, but on some\noccasions something is needed to dry the rain-soaked atmosphere, for\neven in the dry season it has been seen to rain for five successive\ndays and nights without the cessation of a moment.\n\nA long chain of dependents is attached to the household of the rich\nFilipino. The master has his special body servant to be present at all\ntimes to do his master's bidding, in short, to be the visible\nmechanism of his master's volition. So, too, the lady of the house has\nher servant woman to do the slightest bidding of her ladyship. Then\nthere is the cook who is almost invariably a man, a house boy or two,\nand the coachman. These functionaries, with their assistants and\nassistants to the assistants, together with a servant or two for the\nexclusive service of the children, complete the economic household.\n\nSuch a family has an abundance of rice and wheat bread, also of\nchicken and fish with occasional fresh beef. They have also a good\ndeal of dulce. They regularly serve wine and frequently serve beer\non their tables.\n\nIn strong contrast with this mode of life is that of the tao. His\ndiet consists almost wholly of rice and small uncleaned fish boiled\ntogether. As a rule knife, fork, plate, and spoon find no place in his\nhousehold. The rice and fish are boiled in a pot and then allowed to\ncool in the same vessel or poured out to cool in a large earthen or\nwooden bowl. Then Mr. Tao together with Mrs. Tao and all the young\nTaos squat on their heels around the mixture and satisfy that\nintangible thing called the appetite. They do not use chop sticks as\nthe Chinese do, but the rice and fish are caught in a hollow formed by\nthe first three fingers of the right hand. The thumb is then placed\nbehind the mass. It is raised up and poised before the mouth, with a\nskill coming from the evolution of ages, when a contraction of the\nmuscles of the thumb throws the mass into the mouth with a skill that\nis marvelous to any but a Filipino. To judge from the most reliable\ninformation, the poorest class do not have an abundance of food,\nalthough it would seem that such a condition of things would be\nwell-nigh impossible. However, in a census of one hundred school\nchildren there were found six boys and four girls who declared that\nthey had never had enough to eat, and the native teacher stated that\nthis was probably true.\n\nThe wide gulf between the tao and the rich man is filled by the\ngreat middle class of Filipinos.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VIII. - VISIT TO A LEPER COLONY.\n\n\nNot far from our town was a leper colony and the first Saturday that\ncould be spared was set aside for a trip to the place. It happened\nthat none of the other Americans were at leisure on this particular\nmorning, but, rather then delay the trip or miss it altogether, the\nwriter, armed with a revolver, started out alone.\n\nThe road had been described so accurately by one who was supposed to\nknow it that it was deemed well-nigh impossible to miss the way. The\nmain highway was followed to the point where the by-path supposed to\nlead to the settlement turned off through some bamboo thickets and a\nlow tropical wood. This path led straight away towards the sea-coast\nwhere the houses of the colony were said to stand in a cocoanut grove\nby the beach.\n\nUpon arriving at the settlement, a very inhospitable reception was\nreceived from a mangy cur that growled and showed a very uninviting\nset of sharp, white teeth behind his snarling lips. The growling of\nthe dog had attracted the attention of an old man who, with age-bent\nback, was pounding rice in a mortar about fifty yards away. He turned\nslowly around and, upon seeing an intruder into the primitive quiet of\nthe place, gave a sharp, far-reaching call. The sound had scarcely\nrung through the grove when from about a dozen of the little grass\nhouses dotted here and there fifteen or twenty men armed with bolos\ncame out and gathered around the old man. A sense of my danger flashed\nupon me. Three miles from town and alone in a tropical jungle, I could\nbe almost instantly overcome by this band of bolo-men, and the only\nreport that would ever reach my people would be that I had\n\"disappeared.\" Of course, attack was by no means certain, but the\npotentiality of the situation was thrilling. A drawn revolver and the\ngleaming of its shining barrel had the effect of stopping the men, who\nseemed to be hesitating as to a course of action, until a somewhat\ndignified retreat was made to an open space in the rear from where a\nless dignified and a more hasty retreat began which did not stop short\nof Bacalod.\n\nEnough had been seen, however, even in this short visit, to give\nconvincing proof that the settlement visited was no colony of lepers;\nso, that afternoon two servant boys being taken as guides and\ninterpreters, another attempt was made to reach the goal desired.\n\nThis attempt was successful, and, after about two hours of walking, a\nlittle cluster of grass huts snugly hidden by the sea-coast came into\nview. As we approached, one would have thought it a gala-day. Some few\nchildren, apparently from six to thirteen years of age, almost wholly\nnude, were romping and playing in the open space around which the huts\nstood, and no one would ever have thought that any cloud so horrible\nas leprosy could hover over a place apparently so happy.\n\nBy the side of the path as we passed was a man and his wife setting\nout potato plants. His hands were so puffed and his fingers so short\nthat he could scarcely use them, but he was working along as best he\ncould. His wife's feet were so swollen and twisted that she walked\nonly with the greatest difficulty. We passed them by and entered the\nopen space above referred to.\n\nThe children now saw us, and those of them who could darted away like\nfrightened rabbits, each to his own burrow. An old man who was sitting\nin the warm afternoon sun on the little bamboo platform before his hut\nwas aroused from his lethargic repose by the scampering away of the\nchildren. He arose, trembling upon his tottering limbs, all drawn and\ntwisted, and hobbled away into his hut.\n\nThe children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at\nthe doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of\nthe settlement. In a few moments we were surrounded by a circle of\nhuman beings at once so repulsive and so pitiable that its graphic\nvividness can never be accurately portrayed.\n\nThe old man referred to above, having put on a pair of snow-white\npantaloons, appeared now at the doorway of his hut, followed a few\nmoments later by his wife who had evidently clothed herself in the\nbest raiment she had. At a call from the old man, all the men, women,\nand children in the settlement came out of their huts and stood in a\nline before us. The old man was spokesman and in his native visayan\ntongue made a heart-rending appeal for aid which we were powerless to\ngive. Attention was called to a leper woman, apparently about\ntwenty-five years of age, whose face had been attacked by the disease\nand whose appearance was truly pathetic. Upon her hip was a child\nabout a year and a half old and, strange to say, the child showed as\nyet no signs whatever of the disease.\n\nWhat an indissoluble enigma is life! Here in a little cluster of grass\nhuts in a secluded nook of a secluded island of an all but secluded\narchipelago was gathered together a little community of wretched\nnatives, driven by their loathsomeness from association with others\neven of the same half-savage race. Yet here, men and women loved and\nwere married, by mutual trust if not by law, and children were born of\nthe union to live forever under the unspeakable horror that\novershadowed the unfortunate parents. Love, hatred, sorrow, and\njoy--every passion that enters into the complex structure of the human\nheart even here, in this scene of sadness and despair, was playing\napparently as freely as where misfortune and disease had never crossed\nthe portals of life.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER IX. - A \"HIKE.\"\n\n\nWe were lounging lazily in our hammocks at Jimamaylan one evening in\nApril. Supper was just ended, and the soldiers in the post were\ncollected in groups here and there spinning yarns to pass away the\ntime, when a Filipino clad only in a loin cloth came down the street\nat a steadily swinging run and stopped in front of the sentry. He\nbrought the announcement that a band of ladrones had just burned a\nsugar mill and were advancing to sack a barrio about fifteen miles\naway.\n\nThe invitation of the commanding officer to go on a \"hike\" was eagerly\naccepted, and, in ten minutes after the message was given, the troops\nwere on the march followed by two adventurous pedagogues.\n\nDarkness was just closing in as we left the town, but a resplendent\ntropic moon soon made the night almost as brilliant as the day. The\ntrail we followed led over rough and rocky country. Sometimes for a\ndistance of a mile or more we passed over barren wastes of volcanic\nslag poured out in anger by some peak whose convulsions have long\nsince ceased. Again we would descend into a tropical jungle from the\ndense foliage of which the ladrones could have leaped at any moment,\nhad they known of our coming, and annihilated our little band. We\nforded rapid streams with the water at our breasts, and halted only\nonce in that rapid march of fifteen miles.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the town we met a man who was standing\nguard against a surprise by the ladrones. Nothing could well have been\nmuch more grotesque and nothing could much better illustrate the\nabsolutely primitive condition of the Filipinos in the interior of the\nislands than the appearance of this guard. A pair of knee pants, a\nconical grass hat, and a hemp shirt formed his entire apparel. A long\nflat wooden shield, a bolo, and a long bamboo spear with a sharp,\nflat, iron point, completed his equipment for battle.\n\nHere stood the first and the twentieth centuries side by side. The\nFilipino who had advanced only a stage beyond the condition of\nprimitive man with his knife, spear, and wooden shield, stood side by\nside with the American soldier, a representative of modern life with\nhis magazine rifle, his canteen, his knapsack,--with every article of\nhis clothing made to give him the highest possible efficiency as the\nunit of a military organization.\n\nA few yards farther on we met another guard equipped similarly to the\nfirst. Upon reaching the town, news had just been received that a\ndetachment of troops from another post had intercepted the ladrones\nand fought a skirmish with them. The ladrones had escaped and we set\nout in pursuit of them on a chase wilder than a Quixotic dream. We\nwound our way into the mountains behind the town, inquiring at every\ngrass hut we passed whether the band of ladrones had passed that way,\nbut only once was even a trace of them found. Then it was learned that\nat a certain place they had separated into groups of three or four and\ngone glimmering through the dream of things that were. This place was\nin a secluded nook of the mountains where in years gone by some\nadventurous Spaniard had erected a primitive water mill to grind his\nsugar-cane. We had now marched about twenty miles and the feet of the\npedagogues were a mass of blisters. They had reached the point where\nthat form of military maneuvering called \"hiking\" ceased to possess\nany alluring charms. So a native was persuaded to come out of his lone\nmountain hut and hitch up his carabao and cart. He was then made to\nget on the carabao's back, while the aforesaid pedagogues lay down on\nthe sugar-cane pulp that had been put into the body of the cart, and\nthe driver was instructed to start for the post we had left hours\nbefore, and not to stop until he got there. Being uncertain but that\nsome of the ladrones would learn of our having left the body of troops\nand would try the metal of our steel, we at first agreed that neither\nof us should go to sleep, but it was later decided that probably the\ndriver had no greater desire to cross the Styx than his passengers had\nand that in case of danger he would awaken us, so both took a revolver\nin each hand, stretched out supinely and went to sleep.\n\nSuch a sleep! The rough jolting of the cart over an almost impassable\nroad was never enough to break the spell of slumber. When we awoke the\nblazing tropic sun was past the midday mark of morning, shining full\ninto our unprotected and well-nigh blistered faces.\n\nA pack of dogs were heralding our approach to a little village at the\nfoot of the mountains where ponies were procured to take us back to\nthe post.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he insists, \"have stood the test of ages; and the plant\nevery where retained its name and credit: and one of our good\nherbarists, who had seen a wonderful case of a swoln spleen, so big, and\nhard as to be felt with terror, brought back to a state of nature by it\"\n\n(p. 37). The greatest portion of Hill's concluding section combines\nadvertisement for the powder medicine he was himself manufacturing at a\nhandsome profit together with a protest against competing apothecaries:\n\"An intelligent person was directed to go to the medicinal herb shops in\nthe several markets, and buy some of this Spleen-wort; the name was\nwritten, and shewn to every one; every shop received his money, and\nalmost every one sold a different plant, under the name of this: but\nwhat is very striking, not one of them the right\" (p. 42).\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis did not cease to be printed after Hill's in\n1766, but continued to issue from the presses into the nineteenth\ncentury. A good example of this is the tome by John Reid, physician to\nthe Finsbury Dispensary in London, Essays on Insanity, Hypochondriasis\nand Other Nervous Affections (1816), which summarizes theories of the\nmalady. A bibliographical study of such works would probably reveal\na larger number of titles in the nineteenth century than in the previous\none, but by this time the nature and definition of hypochondria had\nchanged significantly.\n\nIf John Hill's volume is not an important contribution in the history of\nmedicine, it is a lucid and brief exposition of many of the best ideas\nthat had been thought and written on the hyp, with the exception of his\nuninhibited prescribing of herbal medicines as cure-alls. An\nunderstanding of this disease is essential for readers of neoclassical\nEnglish literature, especially when we reflect upon the fact that some\nof the best literature of the period was composed by writers whom it\nafflicted. It is perhaps not without significance that the greatest poet\nof the Augustan age, Alexander Pope, thought it necessary as he lay on\nhis deathbed in May 1744 to exclaim with his last breath, \"I never was\nhippish in my whole life.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. I. - The NATURE of the DISORDER.\n\n\nTo call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and cruel. It\nis a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by thickened\nand distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver, and other\nparts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick scarce knows\none more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\n\nThe blood is a mixture of many fluids, which, in a state of health, are\nso combined, that the whole passes freely through its appointed vessels;\nbut if by the loss of the thinner parts, the rest becomes too gross to\nbe thus carried through, it will stop where the circulation has least\npower; and having thus stopped it will accumulate; heaping by degrees\nobstruction on obstruction.\n\nHealth and chearfulness, and the quiet exercise of mind, depend upon a\nperfect circulation: is it a wonder then, when this becomes impeded the\nbody looses of its health, and the temper of its sprightliness? to be\notherwise would be the miracle; and he inhumanly insults the afflicted,\nwho calls all this a voluntary frowardness. Its slightest state brings\nwith it sickness, anguish and oppression; and innumerable ills follow\nits advancing steps, unless prevented by timely care; till life itself\ngrows burthensome.\n\nThe disease was common in antient Greece; and her physicians understood\nit, better than those perhaps of later times, in any other country; who\nthough happy in many advantages these fathers of the science could not\nhave, yet want the great assistance of frequent watching it in all its\nstages.\n\nThose venerable writers have delivered its nature, and its cure: in the\nfirst every thing now shews they were right; and what they have said as\nto the latter will be found equally true and certain. This, so far as\npresent experience has confirmed it, and no farther, will be here laid\nbefore the afflicted in a few plain words.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. II. - Persons Subject to it.\n\n\nFatigue of mind, and great exertion of its powers often give birth to\nthis disease; and always tend to encrease it. The finer spirits are\nwasted by the labour of the brain: the Philosopher rises from his study\nmore exhausted than the Peasant leaves his drudgery; without the benefit\nthat he has from exercise. Greatness of mind, and steady virtue;\ndetermined resolution, and manly firmness, when put in action, and\nintent upon their object, all also lead to it: perhaps whatever tends to\nthe ennobling of the soul has equal share in bringing on this weakness\nof the body.\n\nFrom this we may learn easily who are the men most subject to it; the\ngrave and studious, those of a sedate temper and enlarged understanding,\nthe learned and wise, the virtuous and the valiant: those whom it were\nthe interest of the world to wish were free from this and every other\nillness; and who perhaps, except for this alloy, would have too large a\nportion of human happiness.\n\nThough these are most, it is not these alone, who are subject to it.\n\nThere are countries where it is endemial, and in other places some have\nthe seeds of it in their constitution; and in some it takes rise from\naccidents. In these last it is the easiest of cure; and in the first\nmost difficult.\n\nBeside the Greeks already named, the Jews of old time were heavily\nafflicted with this disease; and in their descendants to this day it is\noften constitutional: the Spaniards have it almost to a man; and so have\nthe American Indians. Perhaps the character of these several nations may\nbe connected with it. The steady honour, and firm valour of the\nSpaniard, very like that of the ancient Doric nation, who followed the\nflute not the trumpet to the field; and met the enemy, not with shouts\nand fury, but with a determined virtue: it is the temper of the\nHypochondriac to be slow, but unmoveably resolved: the Jew has shewn\nthis mistakenly, but almost miraculously; and the poor Indian, untaught\nas he is, faces all peril with composure, and sings his death-song with\nan unalter'd countenance.\n\nAmong particular persons the most inquiring and contemplative are those\nwho suffer oftenest by this disease; and of all degrees of men I think\nthe clergy. I do not mean the hunting, shooting, drinking clergy, who\nbear the tables of the great; but the retir'd and conscientious; such as\nattend in midnight silence to their duty; and seek in their own cool\nbreasts, or wheresoever else they may be found, new admonitions for an\nage plunged in new vices. To this disease we owe the irreparable loss of\nDr. YOUNG; and the present danger of many other the best and most\nimproved amongst us. May what is here to be proposed assist in their\npreservation!\n\nThe Geometrician or the learned Philosopher of whatever denomination,\nwhose course of study fixes his eye for ever on one object, his mind\nintensely and continually employed upon one thought, should be warned\nalso that he is in danger; or if he find himself already afflicted, he\nshould be told that the same course of life, which brought it on, will,\nwithout due care, encrease it to the most dreaded violence.\n\nThe middle period of life is that in which there is the greatest danger\nof an attack from this disease; and the latter end of autumn, when the\nsummer heats have a little time been over, is the season when in our\nclimate its first assaults are most to be expected. The same time of the\nyear always increases the disorder in those who have been before\nafflicted with it; and it is a truth must be confessed, that from its\nfirst attack the patient grows continually, though slowly, worse; unless\na careful regimen prevent it.\n\nThe constitutions most liable to this obstruction are the lean, and dark\ncomplexioned; the grave and sedentary. Let such watch the first\nsymptoms; and obviate, (as they may with ease) that which it will be\nmuch more difficult to remove.\n\nIt is happy a disease, wherein the patient must do a great deal for\nhimself, falls, for the most part, upon those who have the powers of\nreason strongest. Let them only be aware of this, that the distemper\nnaturally disposes them to inactivity; and reason will have no use\nunless accompanied with resolution to enforce it.\n\nThough the physician can do something toward the cure, much more depends\nupon the patient; and here his constancy of mind will be employed most\nhappily. No one is better qualified to judge on a fair hearing what\ncourse is the most fit; and having made that choice, he must with\npatience wait its good effects. Diseases that come on slowly must have\ntime for curing; an attention to the first appearances of the disorder\nwill be always happiest; because when least established it is easiest\noverthrown: but when that happy period has been neglected, he must wait\nthe effects of such a course as will dilute and melt the obstructing\nmatter gradually; for till that be done it is not only vain, but\nsometimes dangerous, to attempt its expulsion from the body.\n\nThe blood easily separates itself into the grosser and the thinner\nparts: we see this in bleeding; and from the toughness of the red cake\nmay guess how very difficult it will be to dissolve a substance of like\nfirmness in the vessels of the body. That it can thus become thickened\nwithin the body, a Pleurisy shews us too evidently: in that case it is\nbrought on suddenly, and with inflammation; in this other, slowly and\nwithout; and here, even before it forms the obstruction, can bring on\nmany mischiefs. Various causes can produce the same effect, but that in\nall cases operates most durably, which operates most slowly. The watery\npart of the blood is its mild part; in the remaining gross matter of it,\nare acrid salts and burning oils, and these, when destitute of that\nhappy dilution nature gives them in a healthy body, are capable of doing\ngreat mischief to the tender vessels in which they are kept stagnant.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. III. - The SYMPTOMS of the DISORDER.\n\n\nThe first and lightest of the signs that shew this illness are a lowness\nof spirits, and inaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love\nof solitude and a habit of thinking, even on trifling subjects, with too\nmuch steadiness. A very little help may combat these: but if that\nindolence which is indeed a part of the disorder, will neglect them;\nworse must be expected soon to follow.\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness, weight, and oppression in the body,\na want of appetite, or, what is worse, an appetite without digestion;\nfor these are the conditions of different states of the disease, a\nfullness and a difficulty of breathing after meals, a straitness of the\nbreast, pains and flatulencies in the bowels, and an unaptness to\ndischarge their contents.\n\nThe pulse becomes low, weak, and unequal; and there are frequent\npalpitations of the heart, a little dark-coloured urine is voided at\nsome times; and a flood of colourless and insipid at others; relieving\nfor a moment, but increasing the distemper: there is in some cases also\na continual teazing cough, with a choaking stoppage in the throat at\ntimes; then heartburn, sickness, hardness of the belly, and a costive\nhabit, or a tormenting and vain irritation.\n\nThe lips turn pale, the eyes loose their brightness and by degrees the\nwhite grows as it were greenish, the gums want their due firmness, with\ntheir proper colour; and an unpleasing foulness grows upon the teeth:\nthe inside of the mouth is pale and furred, and the throat dry and\nhusky: the colour of the skin is pale (though there are periods when the\nface is florid) and as the obstruction gathers ground, and more affects\nthe liver, the whole body becomes yellow, tawny, greenish, and at length\nof that deep and dusky hue, to which men of swift imagination have given\nthe name of blackness.\n\nThese symptoms do not all appear in any one period of the disease, or in\none case, but at one time or other all of them, as well as those which\nfollow: the flesh becomes cold to the touch, though the patient does not\nhimself perceive it; the limbs grow numbed and torpid, the breathing\ndull and slow, and the voice hollow; and usually the appetite in this\nperiod declines, and comes almost to nothing: night sweats come on,\nblack swellings appear on the veins, the flesh wastes and the breast\nbecomes flat and hollow: the mouth is full of a thin spittle, the head\nis dizzy and confus'd, and sometimes there is an unconquerable numbness\nin the organs of speech.\n\nI have known the temporary silence that follows upon this last symptom\nbecome a jest to the common herd; and the unhappy patient, instead of\ncompassion and assistance, receive the reproof of sullenness, from those\nwho should have known and acted better.\n\nAbout twenty years ago I met on a visit at Catthorpe in Leicestershire a\nyoung gentleman of distinguished learning and abilities, who at certain\ntimes was speechless. The vulgar thought it a pretence: and a jocose\nlady, where he was at tea with company, putting him as she said to a\ntrial, poured out a dish very strong and without sugar. He drank it and\nreturned the cup with a bow of great reserve, and his eye bent on the\nground: she then filled the cup with sugar, and pouring weak tea on it,\nsent it him: he drank that too, looked at her steadily, and blushed for\nher. The lady declared the man was dumb; the rest thought him perverse,\nand obstinate; but a constant and steady perseverance in an easy method\ncured him.\n\nAll these are miseries which the disease, while it retains its natural\nform, can bring upon the patient; and thus he will in time be worn out,\nand led miserably, though slowly, to the grave. Let him not indulge his\ninactivity so far as to give way to this, because it is represented as\nfar off; the disease may suddenly and frightfully change its nature; and\nswifter evils follow.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. IV. - The DANGER.\n\n\nWe have done with the obstruction considered in itself; but this, though\noften unsurmountable by art, at least by the methods now in use, will be\nsometimes broken through at once by nature, or by accidents; and bring\non fatal evils. These are strictly different diseases, and are no\notherway concerned here, than as the consequences of that of which we\nare treating.\n\nThe thick and glutinous blood which has so long stagnated in the spleen,\nwill have in that time altered its nature, and acquired a very great\ndegree of acrimony: while it lies dormant, this does no more mischiefs,\nthan those named already; but when violent exercise, a fit of outrageous\nanger, or any thing else that suddenly shocks and disturbs the frame,\nputs it in motion, it melts at once into a kind of liquid putrefaction.\n\nBeing now thin, it mixes itself readily with the blood again, and brings\non putrid fevers; destroys the substance of the spleen itself, or being\nthrown upon some other of the viscera, corrodes them, and leads on this\nway a swift and miserable death. If it fall upon the liver, its tender\npulpy substance is soon destroyed, jaundices beyond the help of art\nfirst follow, then dropsies and all their train of misery; if on lungs,\nconsumptions; if on the brain, convulsions, epilepsy, palsy, apoplexy;\nif on the surface, leprosy.\n\nThe intention of cure is to melt this coagulation softly, not to break\nit violently; and then to give it a very gentle passage through the\nbowels. There is no safe way for it to take but that; and even that when\nurged too far may bring on fatal dysenteries.\n\nLet none wonder at the sudden devastation which sometimes arises from\nthis long stagnant matter, when liquified too hastily: how long, how\nmany years the impacted matter will continue quiet in a schirrous tumour\nof the breast; but being once put in motion, whether from accident, or\nin the course of nature, what can describe; or what can stop its\nhavock!\n\nInstances of the other are too frequent. A nobleman the other day died\nparalytick: dissection shewed a spleen consumed by an abscess, formed\nfrom the dissolved matter of such an obstruction: and 'tis scarce longer\nsince, a learned gentleman, who had been several years lost to his\nfriends, by the extreams of a Hypochondriacal disorder, seem'd gradually\nwithout assistance to recover: but the lungs suffered while the spleen\nwas freed; and he died very soon of what is called a galloping\nconsumption.\n\nWhen the obstruction is great and of long continuance, if it be thus\nhastily moved, the consequence is, equally, a sudden and a miserable\ndeath, whether, like the matter of a cancer, it remains in its place; or\nlike that of a bad small pox, be thrown upon some other vital part.\n\nLet not the patient be too much alarmed; this is laid down to caution,\nnot to terrify him: it is fit he should know his danger, and attend to\nit; for the prevention is easy; and the cure, even of the most advanced\nstages, when undertaken by gentle means, is not at all impracticable: to\nassist the physician, let him look into himself, and recollect the\nsource of his complaint. This he may judge of from the following\nnotices.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. V. - The Causes of the HYPOCHONDRIASIS.\n\n\nThe obstruction which forms this disease, may take its origin from\ndifferent accidents: a fever ill cured has often caused it; or the\npiles, which had been used to discharge largely, ceasing; a marshy soil,\npoisoned with stagnant water, has given it to some persons; and altho'\nindolence and inactivity are oftenest at the root, yet it has arisen\nfrom too great exercise.\n\nReal grief has often brought it on; and even love, for sometimes that is\nreal. Study and fixed attention of the mind have been accused before;\nand add to these the stooping posture of the body, which most men use,\nthough none should use it, in writing and in reading. This has\ncontributed too much to it; but of all other things night studies are\nthe most destructive. The steady stillness, and dusky habit of all\nnature in those hours, enforce, encourage, and support that settled\ngloom, which rises from fixt thought; and sinks the body to the grave;\neven while it carries up the mind to heaven. He who would have his lamp\n        At midnight hour\n  Be seen in some high lonely tower,\nwill waste the flame of this unheeded life: and while he labours to\nunsphere the spirit of Plato will let loose his own.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VI. - The Cure of the HYPOCHONDRIASIS.\n\n\nLet him who would escape the mischiefs of an obstructed spleen, avoid\nthe things here named: and let him who suffers from the malady,\nendeavour to remember to which of them it has been owing; for half the\nhope depends upon that knowledge.\n\nNature has sometimes made a cure herself, and we should watch her ways;\nfor art never is so right as when it imitates her: sometimes the\npatient's own resolution has set him free. This is always in his power,\nand at all times will do wonders.\n\nThe bleeding of the piles, from nature's single efforts, has at once\ncured a miserable man; where their cessation was the cause of the\ndisorder. A leprosy has appeared upon the skin, and all the symptoms of\nthe former sickness vanished. This among the Jews happened often: both\ndiseases we know were common among them: and I have here seen something\nvery like it: Water-Dock has thrown out scorbutic eruptions, and all the\nformer symptoms of an Hypochondriacal disorder have disappeared:\nreturning indeed when these were unadvisedly struck in; but keeping off\nentirely when they were better treated. A natural purging unsuppressed\nhas sometimes done the same good office: but this is hazardous.\n\nIt is easy to be directed from such instances; only let us take the\nwhole along with us. Bleeding would have answered nature's purpose, if\nshe could not have opened of herself the h\u00e6morrhoidal vessels; but he\nwho should give medicines for that purpose, might destroy his patient by\ntoo great disturbance. If a natural looseness may perform the cure, so\nmay an artificial; when the original source of the disorder points that\nway. But these are helps that take place only in particular cases.\n\nThe general and universal method of cure must be by some mild and gently\nresolving medicine, under the influence of which the obstructing matter\nmay be voided that, or some other way with safety. The best season to\nundertake this is the autumn, but even here there must be caution.\n\nIn the first place, no strong evacuating remedy must be given; for that,\nby carrying off the thinner parts of the juices, will tend to thicken\nthe remainder; and certainly encrease the distemper. No acrid medicine\nmust be directed, for that may act too hastily, dissolve the impacted\nmatter at once, and let it loose, to the destruction of the sufferer; no\nantimonial, no mercurial, no martial preparation must be taken; in\nshort, no chymistry: nature is the shop that heaven has set before us,\nand we must seek our medicine there. The venerable ancients, who knew\nnot this new art, will lead us in the search; and (faithful relators as\nthey are of truth) will tell us whence we may deduce our hope; and what\nwe are to fear.\n\nBut prior to the course of any medicine, and as an essential to any good\nhope from it, the patient must prescribe himself a proper course of\nlife, and a well chosen diet: let us assist him in his choice; and speak\nof this first, as it comes first in order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VI. - Rules of Life for Hypochondriac Persons.\n\n\nAir and exercise, as they are the best preservers of health, and\ngreatest assistants in the cure of all long continued diseases, will\nhave their full effect in this; but there requires some caution in the\nchoice, and management of them. It is common to think the air of high\ngrounds best; but experience near home shews otherwise: the\nHypochondriac patient is always worse at Highgate even than in London.\n\nThe air he breathes should be temperate; not exposed to the utmost\nviolences of heat and cold, and the swift changes from one to the\nother; which are most felt on those high grounds. The side of a hill is\nthe best place for him: and though wet grounds are hurtful; yet let\nthere be the shade of trees, to tempt him often to a walk; and soften by\ntheir exhalation the over dryness of the air.\n\nThe exercise he takes should be frequent; but not violent. Motion\npreserves the firmness of the parts, and elasticity of the vessels; it\nprevents that aggregation of thick humours which he is most to fear. A\nsedentary life always produces weakness, and that mischief always\nfollows: weak eyes are gummy, weak lungs are clogged with phlegm, and\nweak bowels waste themselves in vapid diarrhoeas.\n\nLet him invite himself abroad, and let his friends invite him by every\ninnocent inducement. For me, I should advise above all other things the\nstudy of nature. Let him begin with plants: he will here find a\ncontinual pleasure, and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful\nthings; even of the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to\nwalk; and every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket,\nwill afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually\nin the air, and continually to change the nature and quality of the air,\nby visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the lawn, the\nheath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be abroad; and the\nunceasing variety of the subjects of his observation, will prevent his\nwalking hastily: he will pursue his studies in the air; and that\ncontemplative turn of mind, which in his closet threatened his\ndestruction, will thus become the great means of his recovery.\n\nIf the mind tire upon this, from the repeated use, another of nature's\nkingdoms opens itself at once upon him; the plant he is weary of\nobserving, feeds some insect he may examine; nor is there a stone that\nlies before his foot, but may afford instruction and amusement.\n\nEven what the vulgar call the most abject things will shew a wonderful\nutility; and lead the mind, in pious contemplation higher than the\nstars. The poorest moss that is trampled under foot, has its important\nuses: is it at the bottom of a wood we find it? why there it shelters\nthe fallen seeds; hides them from birds, and covers them from frost;\nand thus becomes the foster father of another forest! creeps it along\nthe surface of a rock? even there its good is infinite! its small roots\nrun into the stone, and the rains make their way after them; the moss\nhaving lived its time dies; it rots and with the mouldered fragments of\nthe stone forms earth; wherein, after a few successions, useful plants\nmay grow, and feed more useful cattle!\n\nIs there a weed more humble in its aspect, more trampled on, or more\ndespised than knot grass! no art can get the better of its growth, no\nlabour can destroy it; 'twere pity if they could, for the thing lives\nwhere nothing would of use to us; and its large and most wonderfully\nabundant seeds, feed in hard winters, half the birds of Heaven.\n\nWhat the weak moss performs upon the rock the loathed toadstool brings\nabout in timber: is an oak dead where man's eye will not find it? this\nfungus roots itself upon the bark, and rots the wood beneath it; hither\nthe beetle creeps for shelter, and for sustenance; him the woodpecker\nfollows as his prey; and while he tears the tree in search of him, he\nscatters it about the ground; which it manures.\n\nNor is it the beetle alone that thus insinuates itself into the\nsubstance of the vegetable tribe: the tender aphide, whom a touch\ndestroys, burrows between the two skins of a leaf, for shelter from his\nwinged enemies; tracing, with more than Dedal\u00e6an art, his various\nmeanders; and veining the green surface with these white lines more\nbeautifully than the best \u00c6gyptian marble.\n\n'Twere endless to proceed; nor is it needful: one object will not fail\nto lead on to another, and every where the goodness of his God will\nshine before him even in what are thought the vilest things; his\ngreatness in the lead of them.\n\nLet him pursue these thoughts, and seek abroad the objects and the\ninstigations to them: but let him in these and all other excursions\navoid equally the dews of early morning, and of evening.\n\nThe more than usual exercise of this prescription will dispose him to\nmore than customary sleep, let him indulge it freely; so far from\nhurting, it will help his cure.\n\nLet him avoid all excesses: drink need scarce be named, for we are\nwriting to men of better and of nobler minds, than can be tempted to\nthat humiliating vice. Those who in this disorder have too great an\nappetite, must not indulge it; much eaten was never well digested: but\nof all excesses the most fatal in this case is that of venery. It is the\nexcess we speak of.\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VII. - The proper DIET.\n\n\nIn the first place acids must be avoided carefully; and all things that\nare in a state of fermentation, for they will breed acidity. Provisions\nhardened by salting never should be tasted; much less those cured by\nsmoaking, and by salting. Bacon is indigestible in an Hypochondriac\nstomach; and hams, impregnated as is now the custom, with acid fumes\nfrom the wood fires over which they are hung, have that additional\nmischief.\n\nMilk ought to be a great article in the diet: and even in this there\nshould be choice. The milk of grass-fed cows has its true quality: no\nother. There are a multitude of ways in which this may be made a part\nboth of our foods and drinks, and they should all be used.\n\nThe great and general caution is that the diet be at all times of a kind\nloosening and gently stimulating; light but not acrid. Veal, lamb,\nfowls, lobsters, crabs, craw-fish, fresh water fish and mutton broth,\nwith plenty of boiled vegetables, are always right; and give enough\nvariety.\n\nRaw vegetables are all bad: sour wines, old cheese, and bottled beer are\nthings never to be once tasted. Indeed much wine is wrong, be it of what\nkind soever. It is the first of cordials; and as such I would have it\ntaken in this disease when it is wanted: plainly as a medicine, rather\nthan a part of diet. Malt liquor carefully chosen is certainly the best\ndrink. This must be neither new, nor tending to sourness; perfectly\nclear, and of a moderate strength: it is the native liquor of our\ncountry, and the most healthful.\n\nToo much tea weakens; and even sugar is in this disorder hurtful: but\nhoney may supply its place in most things; and this is not only harmless\nbut medicinal; a very powerful dissolvent of impacted humours, and a\ngreat deobstruent.\n\nWhat wine is drank should be of some of the sweet kinds. Old Hock has\nbeen found on enquiry to yield more than ten times the acid of the sweet\nwines; and in red Port, at least in what we are content to call so,\nthere is an astringent quality, that is most mischievous in these cases:\nit is said there is often alum in it: how pregnant with mischief that\nmust be to persons whose bowels require to be kept open, is most\nevident. Summer fruits perfectly ripe are not only harmless but\nmedicinal; but if eaten unripe they will be very prejudicial. A light\nsupper, which will leave an appetite for a milk breakfast, is always\nright; this will not let the stomach be ravenous for dinner, as it is\napt to be in those who make that their only meal.\n\nOne caution more must be given, and it may seem a strange one: it is\nthat the patient attend regularly to his hours of eating. We have to do\nwith men for the most part whose soul is the great object of their\nregard; but let them not forget they have a body.\n\nThe late Dr. STUKELY has told me, that one day by appointment visiting\nSir ISAAC NEWTON, the servant told him, he was in his study. No one was\npermitted to disturb him there; but as it was near dinner time, the\nvisitor sat down to wait for him. After a time dinner was brought in; a\nboil'd chicken under a cover. An hour pass'd, and Sir ISAAC did not\nappear. The doctor eat the fowl, and covering up the empty dish, bad\nthem dress their master another. Before that was ready, the great man\ncame down; he apologiz'd for his delay, and added, \"give me but leave to\ntake my short dinner, and I shall be at your service; I am fatigued and\nfaint.\" Saying this, he lifted up the cover; and without any emotion,\nturned about to STUKELY with a smile; \"See says he, what we studious\npeople are, I forgot I had din'd.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER: SECT. VIII. - The MEDICINE.\n\n\n'Tis the ill fate of this disease, more than of all others to be\nmisunderstood at first, and thence neglected; till the physician shakes\nhis head at a few first questions. None steals so fatally upon the\nsufferer: its advances are by very slow degrees; but every day it grows\nmore difficult of cure.\n\nThat this obstruction in the spleen is the true malady, the cases\nrelated by the antients, present observation, and the unerring\ntestimonies of dissections leave no room to doubt. Being understood, the\npath is open where to seek a remedy: and our best guides in this, as in\nthe former instance, will be those venerable Greeks; who saw a thousand\nof these cases, where we see one; and with less than half our theory,\ncured twice as many patients.\n\nOne established doctrine holds place in all these writers; that whatever\nby a hasty fermentation dissolves the impacted matter of the\nobstruction, and sends it in that state into the blood, does incredible\nmischief: but that whatever medicine softens it by slow degrees, and, as\nit melts, delivers it to the bowels without disturbance; will cure with\nequal certainty and safety.\n\nFor this good purpose, they knew and tried a multitude of herbs; but in\nthe end they fixed on one: and on their repeated trials of this, they\nbanished all the rest. This stood alone for the cure of the disease; and\nfrom its virtue received the name of SPLEEN-WORT. O wise and happy\nGreeks! authors of knowledge and perpetuators of it! With them the very\nname they gave a plant declared its virtues: with us, a writer calls a\nplant from some friend; that the good gardener who receives the honour,\nmay call another by his name who gave it. We now add the term smooth\nto this herb, to distinguish it from another, called by the same general\nterm, though not much resembling it.\n\nThe virtues of this smooth Spleen-wort have flood the test of ages; and\nthe plant every where retained its name and credit: and one of our good\nherbalists, who had seen a wonderful case of a swoln spleen, so big, and\nhard as to be felt with terror, brought back to a state of nature by it;\nand all the miserable symptoms vanish; thought Spleen-wort not enough\nexpressive of its excellence; but stamp'd on it the name of MILT-WASTE.\n\nIn the Greek Islands now, the use of it is known to every one; and even\nthe lazy monks who take it, are no longer splenetic. In the west of\nEngland, the rocks are stripped of it with diligence; and every old woman\ntells you how charming that leaf is for bookish men: in Russia they use\na plant of this kind in their malt liquor: it came into fashion there\nfor the cure of this disease; which from its constant use is scarce\nknown any longer; and they suppose 'tis added to their liquor for a\nflavour.\n\nThe ancients held it in a kind of veneration; and used what has been\ncalled a superstition in the gathering it. It was to be taken up with a\nsharp knife, without violence, and laid upon the clean linen: no time\nbut the still darkness of the night was proper, and even the moon was\nnot to shine upon it. I know they have been ridiculed for this; for\nnothing is so vain as learned ignorance: but let me be permitted once to\nvindicate them.\n\nThe plant has leaves that can close in their sides; and their under part\nis covered thick with a yellow powder, consisting of the seeds, and seed\nvessels: in these they knew the virtue most resided: this was the golden\ndust they held so valuable; and this they knew they could not be too\ncautious to preserve. They were not ignorant of the sleep of plants; a\nmatter lately spoken of by some, as if a new discovery; and being\nsensible that light, a dry air, an expanded leaf, and a tempestuous\nseason, were the means of losing this fine dust; and knowing also that\ndarkness alone brought on that closing of the leaf which thence has\nbeen called sleep; and which helped to defend and to secure it, they\ntherefore took such time, and used such means as could best preserve the\nplant entire; and even save what might be scattered from it.--And now\nwhere is their superstition?\n\nFrom this plant thus collected they prepared a medicine, which in a\ncourse of forty days scarce ever failed to make a perfect cure.\n\nWe have the plant wild with us; and till the fashion of rough chemical\npreparations took off our attention from these gentler remedies, it was\nin frequent use and great repute. I trust it will be so again: and many\nthank me for restoring it to notice.\n\nSpleen-wort gives out its virtues freely in a tincture; and a small dose\nof this, mixing readily with the blood and juices, gradually dissolves\nthe obstruction; and by a little at a time delivers its contents to be\nthrown off without pain, from the bowels. Let this be done while the\nviscera are yet sound and the cure is perfect. More than the forty days\nof the Greek method is scarce ever required; much oftener two thirds of\nthat time suffice; and every day, from the first dose of it, the patient\nfeels the happy change that is growing in his constitution. His food no\nmore turns putrid on his stomach, but yields its healthful nourishment.\n\nThe swelling after meals therefore vanishes; and with that goes the\nlowness, and anxiety, the difficult breath, and the distracting cholick:\nhe can bear the approach of rainy weather without pain; he finds himself\nmore apt for motion, and ready to take that exercise which is to be\nassistant in his cure; life seems no longer burthensome. His bowels get\ninto the natural condition of health, and perform their office once at\nleast a day; better if a little more: the dull and dead colour of his\nskin goes off, his lips grow red again, and every sign of health\nreturns.\n\nLet him who takes the medicine, say whether any thing here be\nexaggerated. Let him, if he pleases to give himself the trouble, talk\nover with me, or write to me, this gradual decrease of his complaints,\nas he proceeds in his cure. My uncertain state of health does not\npermit me to practise physic in the usual way, but I am very desirous to\ndo what good I can, and shall never refuse my advice, such as it may be,\nto any person rich or poor, in whatever manner he may apply for it. I\nshall refer him to no apothecary, whose bills require he should be\ndrenched with potions; but tell him, in this as in all other cases,\nwhere to find some simple herb; which he may if he please prepare\nhimself; or if he had rather spare that trouble, may have it so prepared\nfrom me.\n\nWith regard to Spleen-wort, no method of using it is more effectual than\nsimply taking it in powder; the only advantage of a tincture, is that a\nproper dose may be given, and yet the stomach not be loaded with so\nlarge a quantity: it is an easier and pleasanter method, and nothing\nmore.\n\nIf any person choose to take it in the other way, I should still wish\nhim once at least to apply to me; that he may be assured what he is\nabout to take is the right plant. Abuses in medicines are at this time\nvery great, and in no instance worse than what relates to herbs. The\nbest of our physicians have complained upon this head with warmth, but\nwithout redress: they know the virtues and the value of many of our\nnative plants, but dread to prescribe them; lest some wrong thing should\nbe administered in their place; perhaps inefficacious, perhaps\nmischievous, nay it may be fatal. The few simple things I direct are\nalways before me; and it will at all times be a pleasure to me, in this\nand any other instance, to see whether what any person is about to take\nbe right. I have great obligations to the public, and this is the best\nreturn that I know how to make.\n\nTo see the need of such a caution, hear a transaction but of yesterday!\n\nAn intelligent person was directed to go to the medicinal herb shops in\nthe several markets, and buy some of this Spleen-wort; the name was\nwritten, and shewn to every one; every shop received his money, and\nalmost every one sold a different plant, under the name of this: but\nwhat is very striking, not one of them the right. Such is the chance of\nhealth in those hands through which the best means of it usually pass;\neven in the most regular course of application.\n\nI would not be understood to limit the little services I may this way be\nable to render the afflicted, to this single instance; much less to\npropose to myself any advantages from it. Whoever pleases will be\nwelcome to me, upon any such occasion; and whatever be the herb on which\nhe places a dependance, he shall be shewn it growing. I once recommended\na garden to be established for this use, at the public expence: one\ngreat person has put it in my power to answer all its purposes.\n\n                        F  I  N  I  S.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris, he was\n\"nominated\" to the Academy. He had but to present an Historical\nPainting in order to take his seat as an Academician.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VENUS AND MARRIAGE\n\n\nBack in his beloved Paris again; thrilled by the atmosphere and gaiety\nof its merry life; in the full vigour of manhood on the eve of his\nthirties; amongst congenial friends; done with the drudgery of winning\nto Academic honour, Boucher saw that the public were not falling over\neach other to purchase religious or historic pictures; he straightway\nturned his back upon these things, and on the edge of his thirtieth\nyear he gave to the world his \"Marriage of the Children of God with\nthe Children of Men,\" in which Venus is the avowed mistress of his\nadoration. It caused a fine stir, and greatly increased his repute.\n\nIn this picture he ends his Italian period and strikes his own\npersonal note. Both this and the \"Venus asking arms for Aeneas from\nVulcan,\" together with the \"Birth of Adonis\" and the \"Death of\nAdonis,\" of about the same period, still show Boucher strongly under\nthe influence of his master, Lemoyne. Indeed, the \"Birth\" and \"Death\nof Adonis,\" their record lost during the scuffle and confusion of the\nRevolution, for long hung side by side as pictures by Lemoyne, until,\nbeing cleaned about 1860, Boucher's initials were discovered upon\nthem, and, contemporary engravings being hunted up, still further\nproved their origin. But in the Venus that now figures in all his\nworks there is that flesh-painting of the nude, and that rosy touch\nupon the flesh of the female figure, that are a far more certain\nsignature of Boucher's handiwork than any written name.\n\nUnfortunately the Salons were closed during Boucher's earlier years\nuntil he was thirty-four, and the record of his work during these\nyears is difficult to follow; but with his service to Venus his\npersonal career begins, and the stream of his Venus-pieces steadily\nflows from his hands.\n\nHe came to her service rid of all prentice essays in craftsmanship, a\nfinished and consummate artist. He found in his subject a goddess to\nwhom he could devote his great and splendid gifts. He painted her\ndainty body with a radiant delight and a rare colour-sense such as\nFrance had never before seen or uttered. He remains to this day the\nfirst painter of the subtle, delicate, and elusive thing that is\nfemininity; he caught her allure, her charm, as he was to catch the\nfragrance and charm of children and flowers; and he set the statement\nof these things upon canvas as they have never been uttered.\n\nThe whole of his life long, Boucher gave himself up with equal and\npassionate devotion to work and to pleasure--working at his easel\noften twelve hours of his day without losing, to the end when the\nbrush fell from his dead fingers, his blitheness of heart or his\ngenerosity of act, and without weakening the pleasure-loving desires\nof his gadding spirit. Out of his splendid toil he made the means to\nindulge his tastes for pleasure; and the gratifying of his tastes in\nturn renewed and created the ideas that made the subjects of his\nartistry. He brought to all he did a joy in the doing that made of his\nvast labour one long pleasure--of his pleasures a riot of industry. He\nplayed as he toiled, scarce knowing which was play and which toil.\n\nThe gossip of his love-affairs makes no romantic story--they were but\ncommonplace ecstasies with unknown frail women. But hard as he worked\nand lived and played, he found time to get himself married in his\nthirtieth year to pretty seventeen-year-old Marie Jeanne Buseau, a\nlittle Parisian--and for love of her, so far as he understood the\nbusiness; for she brought him no dowry.\n\nThe young couple settled down for the next ten years in the Rue\nSaint-Thomas-du-Louvre. Here Boucher lived through his thirties.\n\nMadame was a pretty creature, if we had but Latour's pastel portrait\nalone to prove it. But the pretty features were the crown to as pretty\na body, for she sat often to her lord; and it is clear from his\ncorrespondence with a friend, Bachaumont, that she is the Psyche of\nhis illustrated fable--and Psyche runs much to the Altogether.\n\nMarriage, however, was not likely to imprison Boucher's gadding eyes;\nand it did not. Madame Boucher seems to have had as frail a heart, and\navoided strife by amusing herself, amongst others, with the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who, to gain access to the lady,\ncommissioned Boucher to do the Watteau-like illustrations to\nAcajou--a dull affair. Boucher's pretty wife, herself no mean\nartist, worked in his studio, and painted several smaller canvases\nafter his pictures, gaining some fame as a miniaturist and engraver.\n\nNor did Marriage turn Boucher from his art. Two years were gone by\nsince his nomination to the Academy; he had now to paint the formal\nHistorical Picture and present it in order to take his seat as\nAcademician; and it was in this his thirtieth year that he painted and\nwon his academic rank with the \"Renauld et Armide\" now at the Louvre.\n\nHere he sufficiently subordinated his own style to the academic to\nensure success; and the work was hailed by Academicians and critics,\nincluding Diderot, with enthusiasm. But even here we have his cupids\npeeping round the mythologic event; and Armide herself has pretty\nFrench lips that knew no Greek.\n\nOnce secure of his position, he straightway flung the last remnants of\nthe academic style out of his studio door; and it is a grim comment on\ncriticism that it was just exactly in proportion as he developed his\nown personal genius and uttered the France of his day, that he was\nattacked; whilst the stilted things that he knew were third-rate, and\nwhich he wholly rejected from henceforth, were exactly the things that\nwere praised!\n\nHis election to the Academy, and the enthusiasm over the picture that\nwon him his seat thereat, brought his name before the young king; the\nfollowing year he received his first order from the Court whose\npainter he was destined to become. The decorations in the queen's\napartments were gloomy and had grown black; and he painted in their\nstead the \"Charity,\" \"Abundance,\" \"Fidelity,\" and \"Prudence\" still\nthere to be seen. Indeed, with his gay vision, his pretty habit of\nculling only the flowers from the garden of life, and his quickness to\nset down the pleasing thing in every prospect, Boucher was the\ndestined painter of a Court weary of pomposity and the pose of the\nmock-heroic, and which was wholly giving itself up to pleasure and the\nelegances.\n\nBut neither his new dignity of Academician nor the royal favour, kept\nhim from the bookshops; and he illustrated, with rare beauty and a\ncharm worthy of Watteau, the great edition of the Works of Moli\u00e8re\nin his thirty-first year. It is true that he made as free with\nMoli\u00e8re's world as with the Gods of Olympus; he peoples the plays with\ncharacters of his own day, arrayed in the dress and habit of that day,\nand moving in surroundings that he saw about him.\n\n\nLE MONDE QUI S'AMUSE\n\n\nThe Homely had come upon the town out of Holland, painted with most\nconsummate artistry by Chardin, and was soon in the vogue. Boucher had\na quick eye for the mode. And he straightway set himself to the\npainting of \"La Belle Cuisini\u00e8re.\" Still-life and homely subjects need\nan accuracy of realism and a Dutch sense of these things, a sense of\nsincerity and an appreciation of the dignity of the work-a-day life of\nthe people, in which Boucher was wholly lacking. Above all, it calls\nfor a sense of \"character,\" which, in Boucher, was always weak. It was\na sneer against him that his very broomsticks called for pompons and\nribbons--and there was more than a little truth in the spite. He is\nmore concerned with the accident of the kissing of a kitchen-maid than\nwith the kitchen's habit. He cannot even peep into a scullery without\ndragging in Venus by the skirts, and tricking her out in a\nproperty-wardrobe of a scullery-wench, in which the girl is clearly\nbut acting the part.\n\nHowever, these passing vogues and experiments in different methods\nwere only gay asides--he was working the while upon his own subjects;\nand, to the display by its several members ordered by the Academy, he\nsent four little paintings of fauns and cupids which won him the\nhonour of election as deputy-professor. His brain and hand were very\nbusy, and he turns from one thing to another with amazing facility,\nbringing distinction to all that he does.\n\nBut he painted about this time two pictures of infants, \"L'Amour\nOiseleur\" and \"L'Amour Moissonneur,\" which were the beginning of that\nhost of cupids that he let fly from his studio; they frolic across his\ncanvases and join the retinue of Venus, peeping out from clouds, over\nwaves, round curtains, painted with a perfection that has never been\nsurpassed in the portrayal of infants. He painted their round limbs,\ntheir lusty life, their delightful awkwardnesses, their jolly fat\ngrace, their na\u00efve surprise at life and glory in it, as they had never\nbeen painted before, and have never been painted since.\n\nHe also gave forth in this his thirty-third year a \"Pastoral\" and a\n\"Shepherd and Shepherdess in Conversation,\" with sheep about them and\nin a pleasant landscape, which were his first essays in the style that\nhe created and which made him famous.\n\nHis friend Meissonnier, the inventor of the rococo, stood godfather to\nBoucher's first-born son in the May of 1736.\n\nFrom the very beginning Boucher seems to have been engraved. And these\nengravings, done by the best gravers of his day, greatly extended his\nreputation and popularised him; he fully realised the value of the\nadvertisement as well as his profits from it. Before his thirty-third\nyear was run out he published his well-known \"Cries of Paris.\"\n\nBoucher's description of them, \"studies from the low classes,\" holds\nthe key to that something of failure to realise the dramatic verities\nthat is over all; it gives also the attitude of the France that he\nknew towards the France that he did not, and could not understand. He\ncreated that dainty, pleasant atmosphere that comes floating up to the\nwindows on a fresh morning in Paris from the musical cries of\nthe street vendors; but of the deeper significance of the\nstreet-sellers--of the miserable accent in their life, of their weary\ntoil, of the dignity of their labour--he knew nothing; his brush could\nnot refrain from making elegance and fine manners peep from behind the\nstreet-porter's fustian or the milkmaid's skirt.\n\nBut his thirty-third year was to contain a more far-reaching\nsignificance even than the creation of his cupid-pieces and pastorals.\n\nThe \"Cries of Paris\" were scarce printed when Boucher's illustration\nto \"Don Quixote\" appeared--\"Sancho pursued by the servants of the\nDuke.\" This design was to have far-reaching results that Boucher\nlittle suspected.\n\nThe painter Oudry had been called to the conduct of the great tapestry\nlooms at Beauvais a couple of years before; and in his efforts to\nfurnish the looms with good designs, he now called Boucher to his aid,\nwhose original and fresh style, colour, and arrangement, together with\nhis personal vision, and the enthusiasm and zeal with which he threw\nhimself into the work, at once increased the reputation and the\nproducts of the famous looms. This large designing for the tapestries\nwas, in return, of immense value to the development of the genius of\nthe man, enlarging his breadth of style and giving scope to that great\ndecorative sense that was his superb gift. Thenceforth he was destined\nto play a supreme part in the history of the world-famed factories. He\nnow produced painting after painting for the Beauvais looms.\n\nLife is now one long triumph for Boucher, only disturbed in this year\nby the sad news of the suicide of his old master, Lemoyne. It was in\nthis, Boucher's thirty-fourth year, that the Salon was opened for the\nfirst time since Boucher's infancy, and he contributed several\ncanvases to it.\n\nRigaud, the old Academician, now close upon eighty, straggling through\nthe great galleries, might well blink and gasp at the change that had\ncome over French art since he last exhibited there, thirty-three years\ngone by; but his scoffs and regrets held no terrors for the younger\nAcademicians gathered about. He stood in a new world. A new generation\nwas in possession. The grand manner, the severe etiquette, formal\nmock-heroics, and solemn pomposity of Louis the Fourteenth were\nvanished, and the Agreeable and the Pleasant Make-Believe of Louis the\nFifteenth reigned in their stead. Old Rigaud might blink indeed! Just\nas the imposing and stilted etiquette of the reception-room had given\nplace to the easy manners and airy etiquette of the dainty boudoir, so\nhad light chatter and gay wit and the quick repartee usurped the heavy\nsplendours of a consequential age. France, weary of an eternal pose of\nthe grand manner, was seeking change in joyousness and amusement.\n\nGallantry and gaiety were become the object of the ambition of a\ndandified and elegant day. France became a coquette; dressed herself\nas a porcelain shepherdess; and with beribboned crook and sheep,\nseeking pleasant prospects to stroll through, gave herself to\ndalliance--her powder-puff and patch-box and fan a serious part of her\nunseriousness.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE CH\u00c2TEAUROUX\n\n\nAt thirty-five Boucher has arrived. He is in the vogue; in favour at\nCourt--as well as in the fashion. In his three years from taking his\nseat at the Academy to the opening of the first Salon he has created a\nnew and original style--his cupid pieces, his pastorals, his\nVenus-pieces, his tapestry. Boucher's kingdom lay in the realm of the\ndecorative painter--and he has found it. Torn from the surroundings\nfor which he designed them, as part and parcel of the general scheme,\nhis pictures are as out of place as an Italian altarpiece in an\nEnglish dining-room, yet they suffer less. Several may still be seen,\nas he set them up in frames of his own planning, as overdoors in the\npalace of the Soubise, now given up to the national archives.\n\nThe ghost of the Prince of Soubise, who commissioned them, may haunt\nhis palace, but his kin know the place no longer. The overdoors\nwrought by Boucher's skill look down now on the nation's collection of\nhistoric documents. The \"Three Graces enchaining Love,\" the fine\npastoral of \"The Cage,\" and the pastoral of the \"Shepherd placing a\nRose in his Shepherdess's Hair,\" were to see a mightier change than\nthe usurpation of Louis the Fourteenth's pompous age by the elegant\nyears of Louis the Fifteenth. But this was not as yet. Here at least\nwe see Boucher's art rid of all outside influences, and at the full\ntide of creation; here we have the inimitable lightness of touch, the\nfigures and landscape bathed in the airy volume of atmosphere.\n\nHe seems at this time to have played with pastel, due probably to his\nfriendship with Latour, who sent a portrait of Boucher's wife to this\nSalon. Boucher showed in the use of chalks the artistry and skill that\nwere always at his command.\n\nHe also was putting to its full use his innate sense of landscape,\nraising to high achievement that astonishing balance of landscape and\nfigures in his design--a balance that has never been surpassed; his\nfigures never override his landscape; his landscape never overpowers\nhis figures. His earnest counsels to his pupils and his constant\ndeploring of the lack of the landscape art in France prove the great\nstress he laid upon it.\n\nThe designing of a frontispiece for the catalogue of a personal\nfriend, one Gersaint, a merchant of oriental wares, started Boucher in\nhis thirty-third year upon that series of Chinese pictures and\ntapestries known as the \"Chinoiseries,\" in which he frittered away\nonly too many precious hours, for they were received with great favour\nby the public. The paintings of Chinese subjects designed for the\nlooms of Beauvais are still to be seen at Besan\u00e7on.\n\nBut busy as were his brain and hand in the exercise of his wide and\nversatile gifts, pouring out \"Chinoiseries,\" illustrations for books,\ntapestries on a large scale, landscapes, models for the gilt bronze\ndecorations of porcelain vases, scheming handsome frames for his\npictures, designing furniture and fans--Boucher was true, above all,\n\"to his goddess,\" and painted the famed \"Birth of Venus,\" which,\nthanks to the Swedish Ambassador's fondness for Madame Boucher, now\nhangs at Stockholm; our amorous Count de Tessin, to be just, seems to\nhave had a rare flair for the artistic--besides artist's wives. It was\non the 15th of April in 1742, the last year of his thirties, that the\nRoyal favour was marked by the grant of a pension of 400 livres\n(double florins) to Boucher with promise of early benefits to follow.\n\nTwo years afterwards it was raised to 600 livres.\n\nThis was the year that he painted the beautiful canvas of \"Diana\nleaving the Bath with one of her Companions,\" now at the Louvre. It\nwas also the year that saw his landscape, the \"Hamlet of Iss\u00e9\" at the\nSalon. This \"Hameau d'Iss\u00e9\" was to be enlarged for the Opera, proving\nhim to be decorator there, where he was arranging waterfalls,\ncascades, and the rest of the pretty business, without staying his\nhand from his art.\n\nAt forty Boucher has come into his kingdom. The ten years of these\nforties were to be a vast triumph for him. He was to produce\nmasterpiece after masterpiece. His art had caught the taste of the\nday. He was at the height of his powers. He had done great things--he\nwas to do greater. During these ten years of his forties he poured\nforth vivid and glowing works of sustained power and originality.\n\nWe have a picture of him as he was in the flesh at this time--the\npastel portrait by Lundberg, now at the Louvre--a gay, somewhat\ndissipated, handsomely dressed dandy of the time, smiling out of his\ncareless day, the debonnair man of fashion, the laughing eyes showing\nsigns of the night carousals, which were the rest from the prodigious\ntoil of this vital and forthright spirit.\n\nIt was in this our artist's fortieth year that the gifted old Cardinal\nFleury, who had guided the fortunes of France with rare skill, died,\nbroken by his ninety years and the blunders of the disastrous war that\nhe had so strenuously opposed; and Louis, essaying the strut of\nkingship, became king by act. His indolent character, unequal to the\nmighty business, his indeterminate will fretted by the set of\nquarrelling and intriguing rogues that he gathered about him as his\nministers, he fell into the habit that became his thenceforth, the\nonly thing to which he paid the tribute of constancy--he ruled France\nfrom behind pretty petticoats. He had early shown the adulterous blood\nof his great-grandfather; two, if not three, of five sisters of the\nnoble and historic house of De Nesle had yielded to his gadding fancy;\nthe youngest now ousted her sister De Mailly from the king's favour,\nwas publicly acknowledged as the king's mistress, and became Duchess\nof Ch\u00e2teauroux. Boucher painted her handsome being as a shepherdess in\none of his pastorals. She was no ordinary toy of a king. A woman of\ntalent, with hot ambitions for the king's majesty, fired with the\npride of race of the old French noblesse, it was during her short\nyears of ascendancy over the king that he roused from his body's\ntorpor and made an effort to reach the dignity and eminence befitting\nto the lord of a great and gallant people. He stepped forth awhile\nfrom his drunken bouts and manifold mean adulteries, and set himself\nat the head of the army in Flanders, and strutted it as conqueror.\n\nPoor Ch\u00e2teauroux only got the hate of the people for reward, Louis the\nhonours; for the people resented the public dishonour of her state.\n\nPower she found to be a dead-sea apple in her pretty mouth. The glory\nof it all, the splendours, were not the easily won delights for which\nshe had looked. She had to fight a duel, that never ended, with the\nking's witty, crafty, and scurrilous Prime Minister, the notorious\nMaurepas--and Maurepas willed that no woman should ever come between\nhim and the king--Maurepas who knew no mercy, no decency, no chivalry,\nno scruple. At Ch\u00e2teauroux's urging, Louis placed himself at the\nhead of the army; and France went near mad with joy that she had\nagain found a king. Crafty Maurepas urged on the business; the\nCh\u00e2teauroux suddenly realised his cunning glee--it separated her from\nthe king.\n\nOut of the whirl of things Boucher's fortune was ripening, little as\nhe might suspect it.\n\nHe was painting masterpieces that make his name live. To his fortieth\nyear belong the famed \"Birth of Venus,\" the \"Venus leaving the Bath,\"\nthe \"Muse Clio,\" the \"Muse Melpomene,\" and the three well-known\npastorals now at the Louvre--\"The Sleeping Shepherdess,\" the \"Nest,\"\n\n\nand the \"Shepherd and Shepherdesses.\" Of the many famous Venus-pieces\nthat his hand painted during these years it is not easy to write the\nlist. But having signed the \"Marriage of Love and Psyche\" at\nforty-one, he turned his experimental hand to the homely, realistic\nDutch style that was having a wide vogue, and painted the\n\"Dejeuner\"--a family of the prosperous class of the day at\nbreakfast--showing with rare charm the surroundings and home life of\nthe well-to-do of his time.\n\nAll goes well with Boucher. He changes into better quarters in the Rue\nde Grenelle-Saint-Honor\u00e9, where he lived for the next five years,\nuntil 1749; but his eyes are fixed upon a studio and apartments at\nthe old palace of the Louvre, though the hard intriguing of his\npowerful friends at Court on his behalf failed for some time. He had,\nindeed, to make another move before he arrived at his longed-for goal.\n\nPensions Boucher, like others, had found to be somewhat empty affairs;\nbut rooms at the Louvre were a solid possession eagerly sought after\nby the artists.\n\nIn this year of 1744 Boucher created a new fashion at the annual Salon\nby sending studies and sketches instead of finished pictures; and it\nset a value upon such things not before realised by artists, for\nsuccess was instant and loud.\n\nTowards the end of the next, Boucher's forty-second year, the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who was to take his leave of Paris,\ncommissioned four pictures to represent the day of a woman of fashion,\nand to be entitled \"Morning,\" \"Midday,\" \"Evening,\" and \"Night.\"\n\nBoucher painted one of these for him, now known as the \"Marchande de\nModes.\" The others were painted later, and all had a wide vogue as\nengravings. The correspondence has interest since it reveals Boucher's\nbusiness habits; he was paid for a picture on its delivery, and for\neach of these he was to receive 600 livres (double florins or\ndollars)--about a hundred and twenty pounds.\n\nIn an official document of the Director of Buildings to the king (or\nMinister of Fine Art, as we should say), written in this year of 1745,\nBoucher being forty-two, is a \"list of the best painters,\" in which\nBoucher is singled out for distinction as \"an historic painter, living\nin the Rue de Grenelle-Saint-Honor\u00e9, opposite the Rue des Deux-Ecus,\npupil of Lemoyne, excelling also in landscape, grotesques, and\nornaments in the manner of Watteau; and equally skilled in painting\nflowers, fruit, architecture, and subjects of gallantry and of\nfashion.\"\n\nNot so bad for dry officialdom; the critics could learn a lesson. For\nhe was nothing less. What indeed does he not do? and wondrous well!\nthis painter of the age.\n\nAnd the mighty rush of events is about to sweep him into further\nprominence; the very things which he probably passed by with a gay\nshrug are to enrich him, to help him to his highest fulfilment.\n\nPoor Ch\u00e2teauroux saw that she must lose the king's gadding favour in\nthe conflict with Maurepas unless she joined her lord, now with the\narmy. She realised full well that she had created the new Louis of\nAmbition--that her going must bring the people's hate to her. But she\ndared not lose the king. And she went. Maurepas had overdone his\njibings. The indiscretion at once rang through the land; became the\njest of the army--and Maurepas was not far from the bottom of the\nbusiness. The discreet indiscretion of covered ways between the king's\nlodgings and hers only added to the mockeries, and increased the\npeople's hate against, of course, the Ch\u00e2teauroux. Then upon a day in\nAugust the small-pox seized Louis at Metz; poor Ch\u00e2teauroux fought for\npossession of the king in the sick room, until his fear of\ndeath--Louis' sole piety--sent her packing--shrinking back in the\nhired carriage at each halting-place for change of horses, lest she\nshould be seen and torn from her place and destroyed by the populace.\n\nBut Louis recovered; Paris rang with bells at joy on his recovery, and\nhe entered the city amidst mad enthusiasm, hailed as The Well-Beloved.\n\nHe sent for the Ch\u00e2teauroux to find her dying, Maurepas having to\ndeliver the message of recall. She died suddenly and in great agony,\nswearing that Maurepas had poisoned her--died in the arms of her poor\ndiscarded sister, the De Mailly.\n\nBut this year of 1745 Boucher hears a mightier scandal that is to mean\nvast things to all France--and not least of all to Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE POMPADOUR\n\n\nA young bride had become the gossip of the rich merchant society of\nParis--that class that was ousting the old noblesse from power. She\nwas a beautiful, a remarkable woman; her wit was repeated in the\ndrawing-rooms, she had all the accomplishments; her charming\nname--Madame Lenormant d'Etioles.\n\nDraw aside the curtains of the past and we discover our little Jeanne\nPoisson--grown into this exquisite creature. It has come about in\nstrange fashion enough. The father--a scandalous fellow--having\nfingered the commissariat moneys in ugly ways to his own use, had been\nbanished for the ugly business. Nor is Jeanne's mother any better than\nshe should be; and the wags wink knowingly at the handsome and rich\nman of fashion, Monsieur Lenormant de Tournehem, who has been the\nfavoured gallant during the absence of the light-fingered Poisson.\n\nAnd, of a truth, Lenormant de Tournehem takes astonishing interest in\nthe little Jeanne--watching over her up-growing and giving her the\nbest of education at the convent, where she wins all hearts, and is\nknown as \"the little queen.\" The truth spoken with wondrous prophecy,\nif unthinkingly, as we shall see. Complacent Poisson came home, and\ntook the rich and fashionable, bland and smiling Lenormant de\nTournehem to his arms. Has he not wealth and estates? therefore as\nexcellent a friend for Poisson as for Madame Poisson. The girl Jeanne\nleaves the convent to be taught the accomplishments by the supreme\nmasters of France, the wits foregather at Madame Poisson's, and the\nbrilliant Jeanne is soon mistress of the arts--coquetry not least of\nall; has also the most exquisite taste in dress. Under all is a heart\ncold as steel; calculating as the higher mathematics. She has but one\nhindrance to ambition--her mean birth. Lenormant de Tournehem rids her\neven of this slur by making his nephew, Lenormant d'Etioles, marry\nher, giving the young couple half his fortune for dowry, and the\npromise of the rest when he dies--also he grants him a splendid\ntown-house, as splendid a country seat. And consequential\nself-respecting little Lenormant d'Etioles is lord of Etioles, amongst\nother seignories. So Jane Fish appears as Madame Lenormant d'Etioles,\nseductive, beautiful, accomplished, to whose house repair the new\nphilosophy, the wits, and artists. She has a certain sense of virtue;\nindeed openly vows that no one but the king shall ever come between\nher and her lord. But, deep in her heart, she has harboured a fierce\nambition--that the king shall help her to keep her bond. She puts\nforth all her gifts, all her powers, to win to the strange goal;\nconfides it to her worldly mother and \"uncle,\" Lenormant de Tournehem;\nfinds keen allies therein to the reaching of that strange goal. The\ndeath of the Ch\u00e2teauroux clears the way. At a masked ball the king is\nintrigued as to the personality of a beautiful woman who plagues him\nwith her art; he orders the unmasking. Madame Lenormant d'Etioles\nstands revealed, drops her handkerchief as by accident; the whisper\nruns through the Court that \"the handkerchief has been thrown!\" The\nking stoops and picks it up. A few evenings later she is smuggled into\nthe \"private apartments.\" She goes again a month later; in the morning\nis seized with sudden terror--she daren't go back to her angry lord\nlest he do her grievous harm; he will have missed her. The king is\ntouched; allows her to hide from henceforth in the secret apartments;\npromises the beautiful creature a lodging, her husband's banishment,\nand early acknowledgment as titular mistress--before the whole Court\nat Easter, says the pious Great One. But he has to join the army to\nplay the Conqueror at Fontenoy; and it is later in the year\n(September) before Madame d'Etioles is presented to the Court in a\nvast company and proceeds to the queen's apartments to kiss hands on\nappointment. Thus was Jeanne Poisson raised to the great aristocracy\nof France in her twenty-third year as Marquise de Pompadour.\n\nBoucher had been one of the brilliant group of artists of the\nd'Etioles' circle. That the Pompadour's influence had much effect upon\nhis position at Court for a year or two is unlikely; for she had to\nfight for possession of the king day and night, as the Ch\u00e2teauroux\nhad done, against the queen's party and the unscrupulous enmity of\nMaurepas. To set down Boucher's favour at Court to her is ridiculous.\n\nHe was painting for the queen's apartments at thirty-one when the\nPompadour was a school-girl of twelve. But in the year following her\nrise to power, Boucher painted four pictures for the large room of the\nDauphin, which were \"placed elsewhere\"; and, the year after that, he\nwas at work upon two pictures for the bedroom of the king at the\ncastle of Marly. It is likely enough that the Pompadour directed this\norder. She had almost immediately secured the office of the\nDirector-General of Buildings, which covered the direction of the\nroyal art treasures, for \"uncle\" Lenormant de Tournehem, who was also\na friend of the artist. And from this year it is significant that\nBoucher paints no more for the opposing camp of the Queen and Dauphin.\n\nHe was now giving all his strength to the \"Rape of Europa\" that he\npainted for the competition ordered by the Academy at the command of\nLenormant de Tournehem in the king's name, in which ten chosen\nAcademicians were to paint subjects in their own style for six prizes\nand a gold medal, to be awarded in secret vote by the competing\nartists themselves. Boucher won, by his amiable nature, the good-will\nof them all by proposing that they should so arrange as to share the\nprizes equally, and thus prevent any sense of soreness inevitable in\nthe losers.\n\nBut greatly as he won the good-fellowship of his fellow-artists by it,\nthis picture caused a murmur to rise amongst the critics who,\naforetime loud in his praise, now began to complain of his \"abuse of\nrose tints\" in the painting of the female nude. The fact was that\nDiderot and the men of the New Philosophy were turning their eyes to\nthe whole foundations upon which France was built, art as well as\nsociety, and were beginning to demand of art \"grandeur and morality in\nits subjects.\" They were soon to be clamouring for \"the statement of a\ngreat maxim, a lesson for the spectator.\" Diderot, with bull-like\ncourage, picked out the greatest, and turned upon Boucher, blaming him\nfor triviality.\n\nThe nations, weary of war, concluded the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in\nthe October of 1748. No sooner was peace concluded than Louis\nrelapsed into his old habit of dandified indolence and profligate\nease; and, putting from him his duties as the lord of a great people,\nhe gave himself up to shameless intrigues. He allowed the Pompadour to\nusurp his magnificence and to rule over the land. He yielded himself\nutterly, if sometimes sulkily, to her domination; and for sixteen\nyears she was the most powerful person at Court, the greatest force in\nthe state--making and unmaking ministers, disposing of office,\nhonours, titles, pensions. All political affairs were discussed and\narranged under her guidance; ministers, ambassadors, generals\ntransacted their business in her stately boudoirs; the whole patronage\nof the sovereign was dispensed by her pretty hands; the prizes of the\nChurch, of the army, of the magistracy could be obtained solely\nthrough her favour and good-will. Her energy must have been\nprodigious. Possessed of extraordinary talents and exquisite tastes,\nshe gave full rein to them, and it was in the indulgence of her better\nqualities that Destiny brought Boucher into the friendship of this\nwonderful woman. She became not only his patron but his pupil,\nengraving several of his designs.\n\nBut this, her sovereignty over the king, easy and light in its outward\nseeming, was a haggard nightmare to the calculating woman who had so\nlonged for it. She knew no single hour's rest from the night she won\nto the king's bed. She had to fight her enemies, secret and open, for\npossession of the king's will, day and night; and she fought--with\nrare courage. She won by consummate skill and unending pluck. She made\nherself an essential part of the king's freedom from care. The Court\nparty fought her for power with constant vigilance. Maurepas brought\nall his unscrupulous art, all his ironic mimicry, all his vile jibes\nand unchivalrous hatred to bear against her. He had made himself a\nnecessity to the king; and he never slept away a chance of injuring\nher. He knew no mercy, no nobility, no pity. He made her the detested\nobject of the people. With his own hands he penned the witty verses\nand epigrams that were sung and flung about the streets of Paris.\n\nBut she had an enemy more subtle than any at the Court--hour by hour\nshe had to dispute the king with the king's boredom. And it was in the\neffort to do so that she created her celebrated theatre in the\nprivate apartments, calling Boucher and others to her aid in the doing\nof it. Here the noblest of France vied with each other to obtain the\nsmallest part to play, an instrument in its orchestra, an invitation\nto its performances.\n\nBoucher left the Opera to become its decorator in 1748, and did not\nreturn until her death. For her, he also decorated her beautiful rooms\nat Bellevue. She bought at high prices many of his greatest\nmasterpieces.\n\nThe Pompadour's power so greatly increased that she openly took\ncommand of the king's will; dared and succeeded in getting his\nfavourite Maurepas banished; and herself took to the use of the kingly\n\"we.\" Her rascally father was created Lord of Marigny; her brother,\nwhom the king liked well and called \"little brother,\" was created\nMarquis de Vandi\u00e8res; her only child, Alexandrine, signed her name as\na princess of the blood royal, and would have been married to the\nblood royal had she not caught the small-pox and died. She amassed a\nprivate fortune, castles, and estates such as no mistress had dreamed\nof; and into them she poured art treasures that cost the nation\nthirty-six millions of money. She created the porcelain factory of\nS\u00e8vres, kept keen watch over the Gobelins looms, and founded the great\nMilitary School of St. Cyr amidst work that would have kept several\nstatesmen busy, and of deadly intrigues at Court that would have\nbroken the spirit of many a brilliant man.\n\nIt was in her hectic desire to keep the king from being bored that she\nstooped, and made Boucher stoop, to the employment of his high\nartistry in the painting of a series of indecent pictures wherewith to\ntickle the jaded desires of Boredom, and thereby gave rise to the\nwidespread impression that Boucher's art was ever infected by base\ndesign. But Boucher was, at his very worst, but a healthy animal; and\neven in these secret works for the king he did not reach so low as did\nmany an artist of more pious memory who painted with no excuse but his\nown pleasure.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the Pompadour has been blamed too much for this\nevil act, and too much forgotten for her splendid patronage of the man\nwho, under it and during these great years of his forties, produced a\nseries of masterpieces that place him in the foremost rank of the\npainters of his century. It is impossible to reckon the number of the\npastorals and Venus-pieces that his master-hand painted and loved to\npaint, during these the supreme years of his genius. It is significant\nthat they were painted during the years that saw the Pompadour in\nsupreme power.\n\nBoucher was so firmly established in 1750, his forty-seventh year,\nthat he moved into a new house in the Rue Richelieu, near the Palais\nRoyal. Disappointed in not receiving a studio and apartments at the\nLouvre, he was allowed to use a studio in the king's library. He was\nnow making money so easily that he was able to collect pictures and\nprecious stones and the gaily coloured curiosities that appealed to\nhis tastes.\n\nThe critics were becoming more and more censorious; and one of them\nhits true with the comment that in his pastorals his shepherdesses\nlook as if they had stepped over from the Opera and would soon be off\nagain thereto.\n\nIn his forty-eighth year Boucher's art was at its most luminous\nstage--his atmosphere clear and subtle and exquisitely rendered; his\nyellows golden; his whites satin-like and silvery; his flesh-tones\nupon the nude bodies of his goddesses unsurpassed by previous art. The\nbeauty of it all was not to last much longer.\n\nLenormant de Tournehem died suddenly in the November of 1751; the\nPompadour's brother, Abel Poisson de Vandi\u00e8res, was appointed\nDirector-General in his stead at the age of twenty-five--and soon\nafterwards, on the death of his father, created Marquis de Marigny--a\nshy, handsome youth, a gentleman and an honourable fellow, whom the\nking liked well, and against whom his sister's sole complaint was that\nhe lacked the brazen effrontery of the courtiers of the day. No man\ndid more for the advancement of the art of his time. A pension of a\nthousand livres falling vacant, the young fellow secured it for\nBoucher; and almost immediately afterwards, a studio becoming vacant\nat the Louvre owing to the death of Coypel, first painter to the king,\nBoucher came to his coveted home, eagerly moving in with his family as\nsoon as its wretched state could be put into repair.\n\nThe decoration of the new wing to the palace at Fontainebleau brought\nthe commission for the painting of the ceiling and the principal\npicture in the Council Chamber to Boucher, who had already decorated\nthe Dining-Room. This was the period of his painting the \"Rising\" and\nthe \"Setting of the Sun\" for the Pompadour, now in the Watteau\ncollection, two canvases that were always favourites with the painter,\nbitterly as they were assailed by the critic Grimm.\n\nHe was turning out so much work that it was impossible to give as much\ncare to his pictures as he ought. For he refused sternly, his life\nlong, to raise his prices; by consequence he had to create a larger\namount of work in order to meet his expenditure. It was about this\ntime that Reynolds, passing through Paris, went to visit him and found\nhim painting on a huge canvas without models or sketches. \"On\nexpressing my surprise,\" writes Reynolds, \"he replied that he had\nconsidered the model as necessary during his youth until he had\ncompleted his study of art, but that he had not used one for a long\ntime past.\"\n\nHe soon had not the time, not only to paint from nature but even to\ngive his pictures the work necessary to complete them. The feverish\nhaste which took possession of him in his frantic endeavour to meet\nthe vast demand for his pictures, and the eager efforts of his\nengravers to satisfy the public call for engravings after his works,\ngave him less and less leisure to joy in their doing. And his eyesight\nbegan to fail. His flesh-tints deepened to a reddish hue; and he\nstands baffled before his work, suspecting his sight, since what every\none cries out upon as being bright vermilion, he only sees as a dull\nearthy colour. Boucher has topped the height of his achievement; he\nhas to \"descend the other side of the hill.\" Boucher begins to grow\nold.\n\nIn Boucher's fifty-first year an ugly intrigue of the queen's party at\nCourt to sap the Pompadour's influence over the king by drawing away\nthe king's affections towards Madame de Choiseul-Romanet, a reckless\nyoung beauty of the Court, brought about a strange alliance. The Count\nde Stainville, one of the Pompadour's bitterest enemies, was shown the\nking's letter of invitation to his young kinswoman; and he, deeply\nwounded in his pride that his kinswoman should have been offered to\nthe king, went to the Pompadour and exposed the plot. A close\nalliance followed; and De Stainville thenceforth became her chief\nguide in affairs of state. It was at her instance that the king called\nhim to be his Prime Minister, raising him to the Duchy of Choiseul--a\nname he made illustrious as one of the greatest Ministers of France.\n\nIn his fifty-second year Boucher was appointed to the directorship of\nthe Gobelins looms, to the huge delight of the weavers and all\nconcerned with the tapestry factory. This was the year of his painting\nthe famous portrait of the Pompadour, to whom he several times paid\nthis \"tribute of immorality.\" For the Gobelins looms he produced many\nhandsome designs; and he was painting with astounding industry. But\nhis hand's skill began to falter. His art shows weariness in his\nsixtieth year, and sickness fell upon him, and held him in servitude\nnow with rare moments of respite. The critics, notoriously Diderot,\nwere now attacking him with shameless virulence. Boucher passed it all\nby; but he felt the change that was taking place in the public taste.\n\nThe ideas of the New Philosophy were infecting public opinion; the Man\nof Feeling had arisen in the land; and France, humiliated in war, and\nresenting the follies and the greed of her shameless privileged class,\nwas openly resenting it and all its works. Choiseul had planted his\nstrength deep in the people's party, and was come near to being its\ngod. His masterly mind had checked Frederick of Prussia to the North;\nand the nations, exhausted by the struggle, signed the Peace of Paris\nin 1763. Choiseul, with France at peace abroad, turned to the blotting\nout of the turbulent order of the Jesuits at home. Their attempt to\nend the Pompadour's relations with the king made this powerful woman\neager to complete his design; the chance was soon to come, and the\nOrder was abolished from France and its vast property seized by the\nstate.\n\nThe Pompadour lived but a short while to enjoy her triumph. Worn out\nby her superhuman activities, assailed by debt, she fell ill of a\nracking cough, dying on the 15th of April, 1764, in her forty-second\nyear, keeping her ascendancy over the king and the supreme power in\nFrance to her last hour. Death found her transacting affairs of state.\n\nLouis, weary of his servitude, had only a heartless epigram to cast\nat the body of the dead woman as she passed to her last resting-place.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE END\n\n\nThe death of the Pompadour robbed Boucher of a friend; but her\nbrother, Marigny, remained faithfully attached to the old artist, and\nseized every chance to honour him. On the death of Carle van Loo,\nBoucher, at sixty-two, was made first painter to the king, with all\nhis pensions and privileges that were consistent with this the supreme\nappointment in the art world.\n\nThere had been serious intention of making Boucher the head of the\nEcole des El\u00e8ves Proteg\u00e9s; he had the art of making himself liked and\nof inspiring the love of the arts. He was very popular with the\nstudents and artists, owing to his kindliness, his eagerness to render\nservice, his readiness to encourage the youngsters or to console them.\n\nWhen the riot took place, provoked by the Academicians by their award\nof the Prix de Rome in 1767, the students insulted the Academicians,\nbut hailed Boucher with enthusiastic applause. The reason was not far\nto seek. When a student came to the old master for advice he did not\n\"play the pontiff,\" and, scorning the false dignity of big phrases, he\ntook the brush in his hand and showed the way out of all difficulties\nby simplehearted example, despising rules, and putting himself out in\norder to make things clear to a young artist.\n\nHowever, the Academicians feared he would be an unorthodox master for\nyouth, and appointed another in his place.\n\nA long and serious illness thwarted his keen energies. Diderot was\ngiving himself up to outrageous violence against him. If the old\npainter exhibited at the Salon, Diderot fiercely assailed his art; if\nhe did not exhibit, Diderot as bitterly assailed him for his\nnegligences. Above all, he attacked Boucher in that he did not paint\nwhat Diderot would have painted--but could not. \"When he paints\ninfants,\" cries Diderot, \"you will not find one employed in a real act\nof life--studying his lesson, reading, writing, stripping hemp.\"\n\nPoor unfortunate infants! for whom Philosophy could find no happier\njoy in life than stripping hemp! Boucher was but an artist. He\npainted his generation as far as he could see it, and, with all his\nfaults and weaknesses, he never debauched his art with foreign and\nalien things that had no part in the nation's life; he painted fair\nFrance into his landscapes, not a make-believe land he did not know\nwith preposterous Greek ruins; and best of all, to his eternal honour,\nhe painted infants glad in their gladness to be alive, with no desire\nto send their happy little bodies to school, with no sickly ambition\nto make them into budding philosophers, with no thought of making them\npose and lie as Men of Feeling. He had no joy in setting their little\nbodies to toil--in making them \"teach a lesson to the spectator,\" in\nmaking them stoop their little shoulders to the \"picking of hemp.\"\n\nHe continued to paint as he had always painted--except that he painted\nless well. The wreath of roses was wilting on a grey head. The blood\njigged less warmly in the frail body. The features showed pallid--the\neyes haggard. The sight failed. The hand alone kept something of its\ncunning.\n\nHe went to Holland with his friend Randon du Boisset, but health\nshrank farther from him. Diderot had near spent his last jibe.\n\nIn 1768, Boucher's sixty-fifth year, the neglected queen went to her\ngrave. The king's grief and contrition and vows to amend his life came\ntoo late, and lasted little longer than the drying of the floods of\ntears over the body of his dead consort. A year later he was become\nthe creature of a pretty woman of the gutters, whom he caused to be\nmarried to the Count du Barry--the infamously famous Madame du Barry.\n\nBut neither the remonstrances of Choiseul with the king against this\nfurther degradation of the throne of France, nor his unconcealed scorn\nof the upstart countess, nor the dangerous enemy he made for himself\nthereby, signified now to Boucher, first painter to the king.\n\nBoucher was failing. His son was a prig and a disappointment. His two\nfavourite pupils, Baudoin and Deshayes, who had married his two girls,\ndied.\n\nTo the Salon of 1769 he sent his \"Caravan of Bohemians.\" It was his\nlast display. He had been going about for some time like a gaunt ghost\nof his former self, afflicted with all the ills inevitable to a life\nfeverishly consumed in work and the pursuit of pleasure.\n\nThey went to his studio at five of the clock one May morning, and\nfound him seated at his easel, before a canvas of Venus, dead, with\nthe paint-filled brush fallen out of his fingers.\n\nSo passed he away on the 30th of May 1770, in his sixty-seventh year.\n\nWhen Boucher died, the generation of which he was the limner was near\ncome to its violent end. The rosy carnivals and gay gallantries of his\nage gave way to the blood-stained romance and fierce tempest of the\nRevolution. The garrets of the old curiosity-shops received the\ndiscarded canvases of the master. His shepherds and shepherdesses were\nput to rout by the Romans of his pupil, citizen David. The old order\nwas brought into contempt and overthrown. And with it, Boucher's art,\nlike much that was gracious and charming and good in the evil thing,\nwent down also, and was overwhelmed for a while.\n\nFor a while only. For just as, out of the blood and terror of the\nRevolution, a real France arose, phnix-wise, from the ruin, and in\nbeing born, whilst putting off the vilenesses of the thing from which\nshe sprang, took on also to herself the gracious and winsome qualities\nthat place her amongst the most fascinating peoples of the ages; so\nBoucher has come into his kingdom again--the most gracious of painters\nthat the years have yielded."
