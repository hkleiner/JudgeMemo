                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently\nno time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth dimension of Space\nas a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house\nbecame quite quiet.\n\nOn reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up\nagainst a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realize\nhis position. Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\nhundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the\nDowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone\ninto hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains on\none of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who\nhad been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr\nto nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair\nby the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six\nweeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become\nreconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that\nnotorious sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible\nnight when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his\ndressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and\nconfessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox\nout of \u00a350,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card, and swore that\nthe ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back\nto him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because\nhe had seen a green hand tapping at the window-pane, to the beautiful\nLady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round\nher throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin,\nand who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of the\nKing's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he went\nover his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as\nhe recalled to mind his last appearance as \"Red Reuben, or the Strangled\nBabe,\" his d\u00e9but as \"Guant Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,\"\n\nand the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely\nplaying ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And\nafter all this some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him\nthe Rising Sun Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite\nunbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever been treated in this\nmanner. Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance, and remained till\ndaylight in an attitude of deep thought.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III\n\n\nThe next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed\nthe ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. \"I have\nno wish,\" he said, \"to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say\nthat, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,\"--a very just remark,\nat which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.\n\n\"Upon the other hand,\" he continued, \"if he really declines to use the\nRising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him. It\nwould be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside\nthe bedrooms.\"\n\nFor the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the\nblood-stain on the library floor. This certainly was very strange, as\nthe door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept\nclosely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a\ngood deal of comment. Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red,\nthen it would be vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came\ndown for family prayers, according to the simple rites of the Free\nAmerican Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright\nemerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party\nvery much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening. The\nonly person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia, who,\nfor some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the\nsight of the blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was\nemerald-green.\n\nThe second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in\nthe hall. Rushing down-stairs, they found that a large suit of old\narmour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone\nfloor, while seated in a high-backed chair was the Canterville ghost,\nrubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face. The\ntwins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged\ntwo pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained\nby long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United\nStates Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in\naccordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost\nstarted up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a\nmist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so\nleaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase\nhe recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of\ndemoniac laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely\nuseful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single\nnight, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French\ngovernesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly\nlaughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and\nrang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door\nopened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown. \"I am\nafraid you are far from well,\" she said, \"and have brought you a bottle\nof Doctor Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a\nmost excellent remedy.\" The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at\nonce to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an\naccomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family\ndoctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's\nuncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps,\nhowever, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself\nwith becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep\nchurchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.\n\nOn reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the\nmost violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross\nmaterialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what\nreally distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit\nof mail. He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by\nthe sight of a Spectre in armour, if for no more sensible reason, at\nleast out of respect for their natural poet Longfellow, over whose\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\nhour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides it was his own suit.\n\nHe had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament, and had\nbeen highly complimented on it by no less a person than the Virgin Queen\nherself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely overpowered\nby the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen\nheavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees severely, and\nbruising the knuckles of his right hand.\n\nFor some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of\nhis room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.\n\nHowever, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to\nmake a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his\nfamily. He selected Friday, August 17th, for his appearance, and spent\nmost of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in\nfavour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet\nfrilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards evening a\nviolent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was\njust such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to\nmake his way quietly to Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the\nfoot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\nof low music. He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville\nblood-stain by means of Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent. Having reduced\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and\nhis wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead,\nwhile he hissed into her trembling husband's ear the awful secrets of\nthe charnel-house. With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made\nup his mind. She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and\ngentle. A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more\nthan sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the\ncounterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins, he was quite\ndetermined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be done was, of\ncourse, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling\nsensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each\nother, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse,\ntill they became paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw off the\nwinding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white, bleached bones and\none rolling eyeball, in the character of \"Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's\nSkeleton,\" a r\u00f4le in which he had on more than one occasion produced a\ngreat effect, and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of\n\"Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.\"\n\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the\nlight-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves\nbefore they retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still,\nand, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the\nwindow-panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family\nslept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\ncould hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States. He\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his\nmurdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like\nan evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.\n\nOnce he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only\nthe baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange\nsixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\nin the midnight air. Finally he reached the corner of the passage that\nled to luckless Washington's room. For a moment he paused there, the\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's\nshroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was\ncome. He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had\nhe done so than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid\nhis blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was\nstanding a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous\nas a madman's dream! Its head was bald and burnished; its face round,\nand fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\nfeatures into an eternal grin. From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\nlight, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like\nto his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form. On its breast\nwas a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of\nshame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime,\nand, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\n\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's\njack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler. Once in the\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small\npallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes. After a time, however,\nthe brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to\ngo and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight. Accordingly,\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling\nthat, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid\nof his new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins. On reaching\nthe spot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had\nevidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from\nits hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it\nwas leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable\nattitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his\nhorror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a\nrecumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity\nbed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow\nturnip lying at his feet! Unable to understand this curious\ntransformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there,\nin the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:--\n        +------------------------------------+\n        |         YE OTIS GHOSTE             |\n        | Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook, |\n        |    Beware of Ye Imitationes.       |\n        |   All others are counterfeite.     |\n        +------------------------------------+\nThe whole thing flashed across him. He had been tricked, foiled, and\nout-witted! The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his\ntoothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his\nhead, swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\nschool, that, when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds\nof blood would be wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.\n\nHardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of\na distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh,\nand waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\nreason, did not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back\nto his room, thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose. There he\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was\nexceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which this oath\nhad been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second time. \"Perdition\nseize the naughty fowl,\" he muttered, \"I have seen the day when, with my\nstout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow\nfor me an 'twere in death!\" He then retired to a comfortable lead\ncoffin, and stayed there till evening.\n\n\nCHAPTER: IV\n\n\nThe next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were\ncompletely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five\ndays he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point\nof the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want\nit, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a\nlow, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating\nthe symbolic value of sensuous phenomena. The question of phantasmic\napparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a\ndifferent matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large\noriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every month, and he\ndid not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is\nquite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand,\nhe was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.\n\nFor the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as\nusual between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible\nprecaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots,\ntrod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large\nblack velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for\noiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good\ndeal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of\nprotection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he\nslipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a\nlittle humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see\nthat there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a\ncertain degree, it served his purpose. Still in spite of everything he\nwas not left unmolested. Strings were continually being stretched across\nthe corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion,\nwhile dressed for the part of \"Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley\nWoods,\" he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide,\nwhich the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry\nChamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged\nhim, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and\nsocial position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the\nnext night in his celebrated character of \"Reckless Rupert, or the\nHeadless Earl.\"\n\nHe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in\nfact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means\nof it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord\nCanterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome\nJack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\ndown the terrace at twilight. Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\nLord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken\nheart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it\nhad been a great success. It was, however an extremely difficult\n\"make-up,\" if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more\nscientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three\nhours to make his preparations. At last everything was ready, and he was\nvery pleased with his appearance. The big leather riding-boots that went\nwith the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\nfind one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite\nsatisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting\nand crept down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins,\nwhich I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of\nthe colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make\nan effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water\nfell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his\nleft shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed. The shock to his\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\ncould go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold. The only\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\nhad not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences\nmight have been very serious.\n\nHe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,\nand contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in\nlist slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\ndraughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the\ntwins. The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September. He\nhad gone down-stairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that\nthere, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing\nhimself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of\nthe United States Minister and his wife which had now taken the place of\nthe Canterville family pictures. He was simply but neatly clad in a long\nshroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip\nof yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In\nfact, he was dressed for the character of \"Jonas the Graveless, or the\nCorpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,\" one of his most remarkable\nimpersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to\nremember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their\nneighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a quarter-past two o'clock in\nthe morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring. As\nhe was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any\ntraces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a\ndark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads,\nand shrieked out \"BOO!\" in his ear.\n\nSeized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural,\nhe rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him\nthere with the big garden-syringe, and being thus hemmed in by his\nenemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the\ngreat iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to\nmake his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own\nroom in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.\n\nAfter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins\nlay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\nservants, but it was of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings\nwere so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed\nhis great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had\nbeen engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized a wonderful\nclam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse\neuchre, poker, and other American national games, and Virginia rode\nabout the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire,\nwho had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville\nChase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in\nfact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who,\nin reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best\ncongratulations to the Minister's worthy wife.\n\nThe Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the\nhouse, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let\nmatters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the\nyoung Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had\nonce bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice\nwith the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the\nfloor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state that, though\nhe lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but\n\"Double Sixes.\" The story was well known at the time, though, of course,\nout of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt\nwas made to hush it up, and a full account of all the circumstances\nconnected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle's\nRecollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends. The ghost, then,\nwas naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence\nover the Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his\nown first cousin having been married en secondes noces to the Sieur de\nBulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are\nlineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to\nVirginia's little lover in his celebrated impersonation of \"The Vampire\nMonk, or the Bloodless Benedictine,\" a performance so horrible that when\nold Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in\nthe year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which\nculminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after\ndisinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and\nleaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment,\nhowever, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the\nlittle Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal\nBedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.\n\n\nCHAPTER: V\n\n\nA few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out\nriding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting\nthrough a hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go\nup by the back staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past\nthe Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied\nshe saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother's maid, who\nsometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend\nher habit. To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville\nGhost himself! He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of\nthe yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing\nmadly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his hand, and his\nwhole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so forlorn, and so\nmuch out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea\nhad been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity,\nand determined to try and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so\ndeep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she\nspoke to him.\n\n\"I am so sorry for you,\" she said, \"but my brothers are going back to\nEton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy\nyou.\"\n\n\"It is absurd asking me to behave myself,\" he answered, looking round in\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,\n\"quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and\nwalk about at night, if that is what you mean. It is my only reason for\nexisting.\"\n\n\"It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very\nwicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had\nkilled your wife.\"\n\n\"Well, I quite admit it,\" said the Ghost, petulantly, \"but it was a\npurely family matter, and concerned no one else.\"\n\n\"It is very wrong to kill any one,\" said Virginia, who at times had a\nsweet puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.\n\n\"Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very\nplain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about\ncookery. Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent\npricket, and do you know how she had it sent to table? However, it is\nno matter now, for it is all over, and I don't think it was very nice of\nher brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.\"\n\n\"Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost--I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry? I\nhave a sandwich in my case. Would you like it?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you,\nall the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\nvulgar, dishonest family.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Virginia, stamping her foot, \"it is you who are rude, and\nhorrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the\npaints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain\nin the library. First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and\nI couldn't do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the\nchrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese\nwhite, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing\nto look at, and not at all easy to paint. I never told on you, though I\nwas very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for\nwho ever heard of emerald-green blood?\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" said the Ghost, rather meekly, \"what was I to do? It is\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother\nbegan it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I\nshould not have your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of\ntaste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest\nin England; but I know you Americans don't care for things of this\nkind.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\nand improve your mind. My father will be only too happy to give you a\nfree passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind,\nthere will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are\nall Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\nhave a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family ghost.\"\n\n\"I don't think I should like America.\"\n\n\"I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,\" said Virginia,\nsatirically.\n\n\"No ruins! no curiosities!\" answered the Ghost; \"you have your navy and\nyour manners.\"\n\n\"Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week's\nholiday.\"\n\n\"Please don't go, Miss Virginia,\" he cried; \"I am so lonely and so\nunhappy, and I really don't know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I\ncannot.\"\n\n\"That's quite absurd! You have merely to go to bed and blow out the\ncandle. It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\nchurch, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why, even\nbabies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.\"\n\n\"I have not slept for three hundred years,\" he said sadly, and\nVirginia's beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; \"for three hundred\nyears I have not slept, and I am so tired.\"\n\nVirginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like\nrose-leaves. She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked\nup into his old withered face.\n\n\"Poor, poor Ghost,\" she murmured; \"have you no place where you can\nsleep?\"\n\n\"Far away beyond the pine-woods,\" he answered, in a low, dreamy voice,\n\"there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\nsings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold crystal\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\nsleepers.\"\n\nVirginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\n\n\"You mean the Garden of Death,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth,\nwith the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have\nno yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at\npeace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of death's\nhouse, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death\nis.\"\n\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\nthere was silence. She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\n\nThen the ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of\nthe wind.\n\n\"Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?\"\n\n\"Oh, often,\" cried the little girl, looking up; \"I know it quite well.\n\nIt is painted in curious black letters, and is difficult to read. There\nare only six lines:\n    \"'When a golden girl can win\n    Prayer from out the lips of sin,\n    When the barren almond bears,\n    And a little child gives away its tears,\n    Then shall all the house be still\n    And peace come to Canterville.'\n\n\"But I don't know what they mean.\"\n\n\"They mean,\" he said, sadly, \"that you must weep with me for my sins,\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle,\nthe angel of death will have mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\ncannot prevail.\"\n\nVirginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair\nas he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes. \"I am not afraid,\" she said\nfirmly, \"and I will ask the angel to have mercy on you.\"\n\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as\nhe led her across the dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were\nbroidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back. \"Go back! little Virginia,\"\n\nthey cried, \"go back!\" but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly,\nand she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails\nand goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and\nmurmured, \"Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,\"\n\nbut the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When\nthey reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she\ncould not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly\nfading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A\nbitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her\ndress. \"Quick, quick,\" cried the Ghost, \"or it will be too late,\" and\nin a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry\nChamber was empty.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VI\n\n\nAbout ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not\ncome down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia\nanywhere. As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\nevening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all\nalarmed at first, but when six o'clock struck, and Virginia did not\nappear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for\nher, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house. At\nhalf-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\nof their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of\nexcitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly\nremembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies\npermission to camp in the park. He accordingly at once set off for\nBlackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son\nand two of the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire, who was\nperfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too,\nbut Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a\nscuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gipsies had\ngone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as\nthe fire was still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.\n\nHaving sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran\nhome, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the\ncounty, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been\nkidnapped by tramps or gipsies. He then ordered his horse to be brought\nround, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down\nto dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with a groom. He had hardly,\nhowever, gone a couple of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after\nhim, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with\nhis face very flushed, and no hat. \"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,\" gasped\nout the boy, \"but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.\n\nPlease don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year,\nthere would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me back,\nwill you? I can't go! I won't go!\"\n\nThe Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace,\nand was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down\nfrom his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, \"Well,\nCecil, if you won't go back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must\nget you a hat at Ascot.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!\" cried the little Duke, laughing,\nand they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of\nthe station-master if any one answering to the description of Virginia\nhad been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her. The\nstation-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him\nthat a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a\nhat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his\nshutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away,\nwhich he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as there was a\nlarge common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman, but\ncould get no information from him, and, after riding all over the\ncommon, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase\nabout eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found\nWashington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with\nlanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest trace of\nVirginia had been discovered. The gipsies had been caught on Brockley\nmeadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they should be late. Indeed, they had\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's disappearance, as they\nwere very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his\npark, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search.\n\nThe carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone\nover, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any\nrate, Virginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest\ndepression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they\nfound a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\nwas poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and\nhaving her forehead bathed with eau de cologne by the old housekeeper.\n\nMr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up\nsupper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one\nspoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very\nfond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the\nentreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that\nnothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in\nthe morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down\nimmediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight\nbegan to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded\nthey heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder\nshook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a\npanel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out\non the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her\nhand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs.\nOtis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with\nviolent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.\n\n\"Good heavens! child, where have you been?\" said Mr. Otis, rather\nangrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them.\n\n\"Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and\nyour mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these\npractical jokes any more.\"\n\n\"Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!\" shrieked the twins, as they\ncapered about.\n\n\"My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side\nagain,\" murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair.\n\n\"Papa,\" said Virginia, quietly, \"I have been with the Ghost. He is dead,\nand you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was\nreally sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of\nbeautiful jewels before he died.\"\n\nThe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave\nand serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a\nlighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they\ncame to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia\ntouched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves\nin a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated\nwindow. Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was\na gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone\nfloor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers\nan old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its\nreach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was\ncovered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but\na pile of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding\nher little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the\nparty looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\ndisclosed to them.\n\n\"Hallo!\" suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out\nof the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\nsituated. \"Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.\"\n\n\"God has forgiven him,\" said Virginia, gravely, as she rose to her feet,\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.\n\n\"What an angel you are!\" cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round\nher neck, and kissed her.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VII\n\n\nFour days after these curious incidents, a funeral started from\nCanterville Chase at about eleven o'clock at night. The hearse was drawn\nby eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\nnodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\npurple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville\ncoat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\nservants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully\nimpressive. Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up\nspecially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first\ncarriage along with little Virginia. Then came the United States\nMinister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the\nlast carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had\nbeen frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she\nhad a right to see the last of him. A deep grave had been dug in the\ncorner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service\nwas read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, the servants, according to an old custom\nobserved in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as\nthe coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward,\nand laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms. As\nshe did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its\nsilent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a\nnightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of the\nGarden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a\nword during the drive home.\n\nThe next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given\nto Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby\nnecklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen\nof sixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis\nfelt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"I know that in this country mortmain is held to\napply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that\nthese jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg\nyou, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you\nunder certain strange conditions. As for my daughter, she is merely a\nchild, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such\nappurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I\nmay say, is no mean authority upon Art,--having had the privilege of\nspending several winters in Boston when she was a girl,--that these gems\nare of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\nprice. Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you\nwill recognize how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\nin the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such\nvain gauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\nBritish aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who\nhave been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles\nof Republican simplicity. Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box, as a memento of\nyour unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is extremely old, and\nconsequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to\ncomply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good deal\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with medi\u00e6valism\nin any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was\nborn in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned\nfrom a trip to Athens.\"\n\nLord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister's speech,\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile,\nand when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\nsaid: \"My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky\nancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are\nmuch indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck. The jewels\nare clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough\nto take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave\nin a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. As for their being\nheirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or\nlegal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite\nunknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and\nwhen Miss Virginia grows up, I dare say she will be pleased to have\npretty things to wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the\nfurniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to\nthe ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity\nSir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he\nwas really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase.\"\n\nMr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville's refusal, and\nbegged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was\nquite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to\nretain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of\n1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's first\ndrawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the\nuniversal theme of admiration. For Virginia received the coronet, which\nis the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her\nboy-lover as soon as he came of age. They were both so charming, and\nthey loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the\nmatch, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch\nthe Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less\nthan three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to\nsay, Mr. Otis himself. Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke\npersonally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his\nown words, \"was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating\ninfluences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of\nRepublican simplicity should be forgotten.\" His objections, however,\nwere completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the\naisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his\narm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of\nEngland.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to\nCanterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over\nin the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods. There had\nbeen a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir\nSimon's tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it\nsimply the initials of the old gentleman's name, and the verse from the\nlibrary window. The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses,\nwhich she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for\nsome time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There\nthe Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her\nfeet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly\nhe threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her,\n\"Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.\"\n\n\"Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have,\" he answered, smiling, \"you have never told me what\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.\"\n\n\"I have never told any one, Cecil,\" said Virginia, gravely.\n\n\"I know that, but you might tell me.\"\n\n\"Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you. Poor Sir Simon! I owe\nhim a great deal. Yes, don't laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see\nwhat Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than\nboth.\"\n\nThe Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.\n\n\"You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,\" he murmured.\n\n\"You have always had that, Cecil.\"\n\n\"And you will tell our children some day, won't you?\"\n\nVirginia blushed.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.\n\nYet Millet would have us understand that in spite of this, the\nshepherd is performing a duty to humanity not to be underrated. The\nsheep he has so carefully and conscientiously reared will form food\nto-morrow for many a hungry town-dweller. Further, he would have us\nfollow the peasant as he closes the pen for the night and traces his\ntired steps towards his simple home in the village. The frugal and\nhard-earned meal, prepared for him by his wife, who like himself has\nhad her share of duties to occupy her during the day, is partaken of\nsurrounded by a hungry and joyous group of children. Such themes\nsuggested by the simplicity of his own life appealed to him with\nirresistible force, and it is in their portrayal that his greatness is\nmanifested.\n\nPerhaps no season of the year presented the same attraction for Millet\nas the spring. The period when all the earth after its long winter\nsleep is about to waken into new life seems to have always been a\nsource of inspiration to him. In \"The Sower\" he emphasises the fact\nthat the fruits of the harvest are not to be had without due labour\nbeing expended upon the earth. The sloping field, barren of\nvegetation, and crowned at the top with a small clump of trees, is\nbeing broken up by the distant plough drawn by two horses and guided\nby a peasant. The latter figure is one of the noblest of Millet's\ncreations. By his strained and ever-attentive attitude, by his\ncontinuous tramp over the rough and broken ground, he shows us the\nmonotony of his toil. He crosses the field in one direction, only to\nreturn at an interval of a few feet. In the foreground we have the\nsower, a middle-aged man of typical peasant type, on whose left side a\nbag of seeds is slung. With automatic precision he withdraws a\nhandful, and strews it into the furrows open to receive it. So long as\nhe continues in the same track his labour will be well performed, and\nhence his task is just as monotonous as that of his fellow-worker\nhigher up in the field. The silhouetting of these two figures against\nthe light is symbolical of the labour to be expended in life before\nresults are forthcoming.\n\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that in considering the works of\nMillet, one must not judge him from the standpoint of a mere painter.\n\nHis brush is only the means to an end, and by its means he is enabled\nto bring the fruits of his philosophic observation before us in\npermanent form. It has been charged against the \"Angelus\" that it was\nnot a remarkably fine piece of painting, that many a young artist of\nthe present generation is infinitely better equipped, technically\nspeaking, than the master who wrought this celebrated canvas. This may\nin a measure be true, but it must never be forgotten that Millet\nbrought into play exactly the means which could illustrate his meaning\nin the clearest terms. He had not intended, in painting such a\npicture, to produce a work which would astonish his fellow artists\nwith its brilliancy of handling or magnificence of colour. He wanted\nto make the beholder forget the painter and absorb the lesson. This\nquality runs right through the art of Millet, and it is from this\nstandpoint that we are obliged to weigh his merits.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE\n\n\nJean Fran\u00e7ois Millet was born on October 4, 1814, that is at the\nperiod when French art, at any rate as far as landscape painting is\nconcerned, had reached its lowest ebb. Throughout the eighteenth\ncentury the landscape painter had been hard put to make a living. The\ntaste of connoisseurs throughout the century had been for portraits\nand interiors, or for those numerous pastoral subjects which were\ncarried out with so much decorative charm by such men as Watteau and\nBoucher. Such landscape painting as existed was of the type\npopularised by Vernet; it was built upon a curious mixture of Italian\ninfluence coming from Panini and Salvator Rosa. The only evidence of\nrevolt against such a state of affairs we find in the works of Hubert\nRobert and Moreau. These two, and more especially would I direct the\nreader's attention to the latter, struggled hard to break down the\nconventionalities of the time. They endeavoured to infuse some sense\nof atmosphere into their pictures, and whilst frequently their trees\nand figures are painfully formal, they yet stand alone in the French\nschool as the pioneers of a phase of art which was to attain its\nzenith in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBut after the Revolution, and during the whole of the time that France\nwas under the domination of Napoleon, very rigid principles indeed\nwere enforced with regard to the direction that art should take. The\ninnovation which had its commencement in the reign of Louis XVI. swept\neverything before it as it gained force. Classical art and traditions\ndominated the whole French school, and no artist, however great his\nreputation, attempted for many years to swim against the stream. In\nspite of the principles of liberty and equality which were claimed for\nall under the new r\u00e9gime, a terribly strict eye was kept upon any\ninnovations which might break out in the form of a naturalistic art.\n\nThe directors of this new movement failed to see that the conditions\nwhich had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed\naway, and that the latter's supremacy was due to the fact that their\nproductions were symbolical of the loftiest thoughts of their own\nepoch. The art which expresses the ambitions and noblest thoughts of\nits time will alone endure. These expressions are not applicable to\nany other condition than those which called them forth, and hence in\nattempting to purify the rococo which had existed up to the middle of\nthe eighteenth century, by a return to classical traditions, they were\nonly copying that which their predecessors had done, and in so doing\nleft us without any original expression of their own time.\n\nInto such a condition of affairs was Millet born, and he was numbered\namongst that little band of men which included Rousseau, Corot, Dupr\u00e9,\nDiaz, and Daumier, who were to lay the foundations of the modern\nnaturalistic school. At the outset it was seemingly a hopeless\nstruggle they undertook; a struggle against prejudice and influence\nwhich was only to be brought to a victorious culmination after years\nof struggle and disappointment. Of this little band, Millet was\nperhaps the best equipped for the privations which were necessary. He\ncame of a peasant stock who inhabited Gruchy, a small village\nsituated in the commune of Gr\u00e9ville, close to Cherbourg. Grouped\nunderneath the humble roof was the grandmother, who had been left a\nwidow fifteen years before; her son, Jean Louis Nicolas Millet, and\nhis wife and eight children, of which our artist was the second. His\ngrandmother appears to have been a pious old lady, whose chief delight\nwas in her grandchildren, to whom she taught those religious\nprinciples which stood them in good stead in after life. We are told\nthat Millet's father possessed a force of character one does not often\nfind amongst men in his rank of life. He was of a contemplative\ndisposition, and had a keenly developed feeling for natural beauty. He\npossessed moreover a keen appreciation of music, which unfortunately\nhe does not appear to have had much opportunity of cultivating. His\nwife was an excellent housewife and of a religious turn of mind. The\nhouse they occupied, situated quite a short distance from the sea, was\nplaced in a tract of country which, whilst it had rugged and\npicturesque features, was not of a nature which would yield\nextraordinary results under cultivation. It was, therefore, a hard\nstruggle for existence which Millet in his first years saw going\non around him. Not that the family were any the less happy for having\nto work laboriously for their livelihood. They had been brought up\namidst such surroundings; their wants were simple and easily\ngratified, and the tranquillity of the m\u00e9nage more than\ncounterbalanced those doubtful luxuries which easier circumstances\nwould have brought their way. Throughout his life Millet maintained\nthe extreme simplicity he had seen practised in the home of his\nchildhood, and long years afterwards he was accustomed to look back\nwith pleasureable memories upon his early years.\n\nGruchy, situated in one of the wildest parts of Normandy, feels the\nfull effect of every storm which blows up from the Atlantic. There is\nnothing to shelter the exposed hamlets studded along the coast from\nthe fury of the western gale, and the rocks are but too often strewn\nwith the wrecks of vessels which have come to grief in that terrible\nsea. Millet in his youth must have witnessed many of these\ncatastrophes. Quite a number of drawings by him are extant\nrepresenting succour being extended to some vessel in difficulties, or\nthe hauling up of some wreckage on to the rocks. The studious boy\nmust have been impressed as he saw the sternness of the combat in his\nnative country between men and nature; the wind-swept fields, and\nhills bare to the point of savageness. The very trees themselves\ndwarfed and gnarled; in their struggle with the elements they have\nbeen made tough and hardy as the inhabitants of the country\nthemselves, and, stunted as they are, yet show well that they can\nresist the force of the fiercest storm. The brooding and contemplative\ncharacter of the father having descended to the son, we can quite\nimagine the effect such surroundings would have upon him. As he looked\nback in after years upon his roamings in his native country, he\nappreciated the awe-inspiring character of the scenery in which he had\nbeen born. He would doubtless recall many a walk amidst the fields\nwith the wind blowing in his face as it rushed in from the Atlantic,\nthe rain beating hard upon the freshly ploughed fields, and the\ndistant figure of the ploughman struggling hard with his team against\nthe stiff sou'wester. The great mass of vapour overhead whirled before\nthe violence of the storm, casting grey and pearly light over the\nwhole scene, whilst far away on the top of the hill a clump of trees,\nbent with their resistance to the wind, are silhouetted against the\nsky. Many a drawing of this kind we encounter in the later work of\nMillet, which shows how his thoughts harked back in certain moments to\nthe scenes he had left behind him for ever.\n\nWe know that on one or two occasions he returned to Gruchy. Once or\ntwice he had urgent business which took him back, but sometimes he\nwent with no other purpose than to renew acquaintance with the scenes\nof yore.\n\nLittle Jean Fran\u00e7ois was his grandmother's favourite. It was she who\ntaught him the names of things which surrounded him, and perhaps\ndirected his thoughts in the channels to which they were finally to be\ndevoted. Her brother Charles, who formed one of the family, used to\ntake him for walks, telling him stories on the way. Millet was\ndevotedly attached to this old man, and when at the age of seven years\nhe lost him, the gap in his life thus left made an impression upon his\nmemory never to be effaced.\n\nFive years afterwards he was placed in the hands of the vicar for the\npurpose of preparing him for his first communion. The good man seems\nto have been taken with the child; he found him so attentive to all\nnatural phenomenon which was passing around him and intelligent in an\nunusual degree. He quickly learnt a considerable amount of Latin,\nwhich introduced him to the great classics. Unfortunately for Millet,\nthe vicar accepted an offer of transference to a better parish in the\nvicinity. The boy had made such progress with his master that it was\ndecided that he should go with him to his new abode. He was, however,\nso missed in his own home, that when he came back for his first\nholidays it was decided that he should not return.\n\nHe now gave serious attention to the agricultural pursuits of his\nfather. He threw himself heartily into the work of the farm, and\nassisted in the work of sowing and harvesting, of pruning and\nthrashing according to the season. His spare time was occupied in\nreading with avidity various masterpieces of literature. The authors\nhe found at hand were such as F\u00e9n\u00e9lon and Bossuet, but he developed a\ndecided preference, which lasted till the end of his life, for Virgil\nand the Bible.\n\nIt was at this time that his taste for art began to be developed.\n\nHe drew the objects he found around him, and soon acquired sufficient\nconfidence in his skill to execute a large drawing representing two\nshepherds keeping guard over their sheep. These first efforts date\nfrom about his seventeenth year, and foretell the advent of the style\nin which he was later to become pre-eminent.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE MIGRATION TO PARIS\n\n\nHow frequently has it happened that the first years in the life of a\ngenius have been employed in labour quite different from that to which\nthey should have been directed. Such a state of affairs the more often\noccurs when the sense of duty has been strong enough to overcome\ntemporarily the inclination to pursue the natural bent. In the case of\nMillet, however, the early years which he devoted to the farm and its\npursuits were by no means wasted. It is on record that he became very\nproficient in the various duties in which he was engaged, but at the\nsame time we can be quite sure that his extraordinary faculties of\nobservation were constantly being brought into play, and the fruits of\nhis observations are to be seen in the pictures of his mature period.\n\nA considerable portion of his spare time was taken up with drawing,\nnot only the persons and objects he found around him, but also\nsubjects suggested to him by the books he was in the habit of reading.\n\nHis family, so far from throwing any obstacles in his way, encouraged\nhim. In fact it was his father who took him first to Cherbourg in\norder to show a painter of that town, named Mouchel, the early\nproducts of his son's genius. The decision at which Millet p\u00e8re had\narrived was prompted by a drawing in charcoal of an old peasant\nwalking along the road, which had struck him forcibly as being a work\nof extraordinary merit. It says much for Mouchel's breadth of mind\nthat he was equally impressed with the drawings. A man who had been\nbrought up in the school of David, and who had lived in one of the\nmost reactionary periods of French art, was hardly to be expected to\ntake kindly to a style so diametrically opposed to all the traditions\ninto which he himself had been inculcated; certainly the young\nMillet, who had now arrived at the age of eighteen, had not developed\nthe extraordinary freedom which his works of ten years later\ndemonstrate. But there was sufficient originality even in his early\ndrawings to call forth condemnation from a man who had been so\nsaturated with the teaching of David.\n\nHe prevailed upon Millet to leave his son with him, and set him to\nwork to copy many well-known works of art which he brought before his\npupil by means of engravings. Two months were spent in this way when\nnews reached Millet that his father had been seized with sudden\nillness, and he was obliged in the circumstances to return to\nGr\u00e9ville. He arrived to find the old man unconscious, and very shortly\nafterwards he died.\n\nThis misfortune awoke in Millet a sense of duty which compelled him to\ndesert his studies in Cherbourg and superintend the management of the\nfarm. For some time he devoted himself entirely to his new duties, but\nthe struggle betwixt duty and genius continued; he gave himself to his\nwork with all the energy at his disposal, but his thoughts were ever\nwandering to his art.\n\nAdded to his own inclinations, his grandmother, who perceived his\nextraordinary gifts, strongly persuaded him to devote his attention\nentirely to art, and consequently after some little time he decided to\nreturn to Cherbourg. Here he entered the studio of M. Langlois, an\nartist whose reputation in the town was considerable. Again in this\nworthy man he came in contact with a painter who had been brought up\nentirely under classical influence. Langlois, who had in his early\ndays been a pupil of Gros, had absorbed the classical tradition to\nsuch an extent as to be incapable of appreciating any other style. He\nappears to have endeavoured to mould Millet in his own method rather\nthan develop the latent genius which the latter possessed. The\nincompatibility of these two men speedily caused the younger to strike\nout in his own way. He saw more good in frequenting the museums and\nmaking copies of such works as appealed to him than in listening to\nthe advice of his teacher. All this occurred, however, without any\nbreach of friendship occurring. On the contrary, Langlois, after\nperceiving the futility of inducing his pupil to follow in his\nfootsteps, did all he could to advance his interests.\n\nBy means of his influence some of Millet's drawings were brought\nbefore the Municipal Council, and Langlois suggested that Millet\nshould be sent to Paris in order to further his development, and that\nthe Council should set aside a modest pension to meet his requirements\nin that city. The discussion appears to have been very prolonged, and\nupon the question being put to a vote it was only carried by means of\nthe casting vote of the mayor. Four hundred francs was at first\nallotted to him in this way, which was further increased shortly\nafterwards to six hundred. Such encouragement, meagre though it was,\nwas sufficient to give him a foothold in the metropolis. He left\nCherbourg in January 1837, on a cold and raw day, the snow falling\nheavily throughout the entire journey, and arrived in Paris in a very\ndisheartened condition. The miserable weather, coupled with the long\njourney in which he had had time to think of the small sum which lay\nbetween him and starvation, going to a city which he had never seen\nbefore, had all served to work upon his nerves, and he entered the\ngreat city sick at heart and very despondent.\n\nOne of the first visits he made after he was somewhat settled down in\nParis was to the Louvre. Here he was brought into contact for the\nfirst time with many masters, who were to mould his yet plastic\ntemperament into the form which enabled him to give to the world, in\nlater years, so many masterpieces. As I have said before, it was\nMantegna who first captivated him, and the influence of the mighty\nPaduan was never finally to be shaken off. Michel Angelo awed him with\nhis sublimity; his classical severity tempered with intense humanism,\nhis masculine strength, were bound to have their effect upon so\nserious a character as Millet. Strange as it may seem to those who are\nbut superficially acquainted with his art, and are only too apt to\njudge him by the influence he has had upon modern French painting, he\nwas fascinated with the antique. The traditions of Phidias and\nPraxiteles, in the form in which they had been transmitted through the\ngreatest minds of the Renaissance, were ever the factors which guided\nhim throughout his career. It was this same spirit which impelled his\nfervid admiration for Nicolas Poussin, a master who to-day is sadly\nunderrated and but little understood. It was the mysteries of line,\nthe wonders of pose and composition rather than the magic of colour\nwhich appealed to him. He had a profound admiration for the glowing\ncanvases of Titian and Rubens, but he could never overlook entirely\ntheir defects of drawing or, in the case of Rubens, the tendency to\nvulgarity. From his remarks in after years it would appear that he was\nbaffled with the mysticisms of Velazquez and Rembrandt; pure painting\nitself could never hold him. He needed to grasp the message which lay\nbehind it before he felt fully taken into the confidence of the\npainter; and as the minds of the Dutchman and the Spaniard ran in\nquite different channels to his own, they spoke with a language he\nnever understood. That he had a perceptive and critically independent\nmind may be gauged from his enthusiasm for Delacroix, whose work he\nencountered for the first time at the Luxembourg.\n\nDuring this period of study he was carefully considering under what\nmaster he should place himself. His choice unhappily fell upon\nDelaroche. To any one acquainted with the work of the latter master,\na more unsuitable selection could not have been made. Delaroche and\nthe painters who surrounded him can be appropriately described as\nconstituting the back-wash of the Empire style, which had reached its\nclimax with David. His subjects were always treated with academic\nreserve. No pyrotechnics were permitted; on the contrary, an\neverlasting and mistaken striving for finish was encouraged:\noriginality was sternly suppressed. To paint human life as it really\nwas, was too vulgar for any of the painters of this time. They held\nthe public taste enslaved for years. An innovator such as Millet was\ndestined to become found his position almost untenable. The band of\ncritics and painters formed a monopoly which it seemed almost\nimpossible to break down, and it was only after years of bitter and\ndetermined struggle that the school of nature finally routed its\nopponent.\n\nDelaroche doubtlessly found the peasant painter a little rude both in\nhis person and in his ideas about art. He paid but little attention to\nthe young man who had placed himself in his hands, and devoted all his\ntime to students who were more amenable to his influence. A\ntemperament so sensitive as Millet's was bound to notice this\nneglect, and consequently after a time he became so discouraged that\nhe ceased to frequent Delaroche's studio. Another very good reason for\nthis action was the lack of resources to continue his payments. Even\nduring the time he had been with Delaroche he lost no opportunity of\nturning a few honest francs by painting the portraits of any who could\nbe got to sit to him. Delaroche, however, had a more kindly heart than\nMillet imagined. He seems to have found out the real distress of the\nyoung artist, and to have assisted him pecuniarily in many ways, and\nthere is no doubt that he appreciated the talent of the young Norman\nmuch more than he cared to own. Many of his remarks on record would\nserve to show that Delaroche already felt that his pupil was destined\nto be one of the leaders of the movement which was finally to\noverthrow his own style, and doubtlessly felt a great admiration for a\nman who had the courage and strength to swim against rather than with\nthe current.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STRUGGLE FOR RECOGNITION\n\n\nFreed from all encumbrances save poverty, Millet was now to work out\nhis own destiny according to the dictates of his genius. He joined a\nfriend named Marolle, and the two together occupying a very small\napartment endeavoured to eke out an existence. It was only too soon\napparent that young as he was, and the taste of the public being not\nyet ready for development upon the lines his genius directed him, that\nhis livelihood could not be secured by endeavouring to sell such\nsubjects as appealed to him. In these straits he turned to\nportrait-painting, just as many great painters before and since him\nhave done. That the struggle was very keen can well be imagined by the\nfact that he was unable to obtain more than five to ten francs apiece;\nand, as commissions were very scarce, he was hard put to gain the\nmeans of subsistence. This state of affairs lasted until 1840, in\nwhich year he endeavoured to obtain admission to the Salon with two\nportraits, one of which was that of his friend. This, however, was\nrejected, and the other picture, although accepted, was unnoticed by\neither the critics or the public.\n\nHaving occasion the next year to pay a visit to Cherbourg, he felt\nobliged to report himself to the Municipal Council who had had the\ngenerosity to send him in the first place to Paris. Its worthy members\nexpressed themselves as but little satisfied with the result of their\ninvestment; they claimed that they had had as yet but little to show\nfor their money, and they suggested, partly as a means of\ndemonstrating that they had had some little return, and also, in order\nto see of what stuff their prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was made, that he should paint a\nportrait of the recently deceased mayor. As Millet had not been\npersonally acquainted with that worthy citizen, and as the only guide\nwhich could be supplied him was a portrait made in miniature when he\nwas a young man of some twenty-three or twenty-four years of age, the\ntask was by no means easy. However, the artist set to work with a\nwill, and finally accomplished the picture to his own satisfaction.\n\nUpon it being shown to the Council, one and all declared, as any one\nwith the slightest knowledge of such matters could have told them\nbefore it was commenced, that it bore not the least resemblance to the\ndefunct magistrate. They therefore demurred at the three hundred\nfrancs they had agreed to pay him for the portrait, and offered him\none-third of that amount instead. Millet was deeply offended by the\ninsult, and informed the Council that he made them a present of the\npicture.\n\nIt was during this short visit to his native country that he met his\nfirst wife, a Mlle. Ono, whose portrait he had painted. From the first\nshe was very delicate, and he lost her after much suffering, three\nyears later. His second wife was Mlle. Catherine Lemaire, who was\ndestined to be the companion of his struggles until the end of his\nlife.\n\nMeanwhile Millet was occupied with subjects which he thought would\nappeal to the general public. A number of classical pictures date from\nthis epoch. It was an endeavour on his part to fall in as far as\npossible with the current taste, and so supply means of subsistence\nfor his family. At the same time he did not neglect his favourite\nsubjects, and many are the wonderful studies of peasant life which\ndate from these years. His reputation had so far advanced that he was\noffered the position of teacher of drawing in the college at\nCherbourg. It must have been only after prolonged deliberation that he\nrefused the proffered post. Here a certain annual stipend was assured\nhim, and if it was not large in itself it would at any rate suffice to\nkeep the wolf from the door. He preferred, however, to return to Paris\nand work out his own destiny as best he might.\n\nMillet, who lived at this time in the Rue Rochechouart, began to\nsurround himself with that little group of friends who remained\nfaithful to him until the end of his career. Amongst the earliest were\nCharles Jacque and Diaz: the latter had several clients amongst the\nsmall dealers, whom he induced to visit Millet's studio and make now\nand again a small purchase.\n\nMillet now became a fairly regular contributor to the Salon, but\ngenerally sent some classical or religious picture as well as one of\nhis peasant subjects. For example, in 1848 he sent the marvellous\nstudy of \"The Winnower,\" which we all know so well, accompanied by a\ncanvas, \"The Captivity of the Jews at Babylon.\" The latter, however,\nwas so badly received that he utilised the canvas upon its return for\na large picture of a \"Shepherdess tending her Sheep.\"\n\nIn spite of the headway that he was making, the struggle for existence\nseemed keener than ever, and but for the kindness of friends he and\nhis family would frequently have actually wanted for food. A timely\nadvance of one hundred francs obtained for him from the Minister of\nFine Arts, together with a commission from the State, for which he was\npaid the sum of eighteen hundred francs, were for some time the only\nrelief he obtained from his embarrassments. That he was not particular\nas to how he earned his daily bread is apparent from the fact that he\ndid not despise an order for a shop sign for a midwife, for which he\nwas paid the miserable amount of thirty francs.\n\nThe year 1848 was not an encouraging one for a painter who was\nstanding on the threshold of his career. The whole of Europe was\nseething with revolution. A repetition of the fearful year of 1792 was\neverywhere expected. The struggle betwixt reaction and property on the\none hand, and lawlessness and revolution on the other, was being waged\nwith grim determination. The issue was for long in the balance. One\nnever knew from one day to another what was going to happen. In such a\ndeplorable state of affairs men's minds were running on politics and\nwars rather than upon art. Millet amongst the rest was called upon to\nshoulder the musket, and it can be easily imagined with what\nreluctance he did so.\n\nParis, the great centre of art, had yet not afforded him much\nencouragement. Life was dear in the big city, and surrounded on all\nsides by bricks and mortar he was not free to go out into the fields\nand study the objects which were uppermost in his mind. He resolved to\nescape from it, and once having put the plan into execution he never\nreturned.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET IN HIS MATURITY\n\n\nThe Barbizon of 1850 was a very different place from the Barbizon of\nto-day. The world fame of the men who passed a quiet and strenuous\nexistence in the little village has transformed it into a tourist\nresort, with restaurants and caf\u00e9s, the stopping-places for\nwaggonettes which in summer bring their daily load of sightseers,\neager to see the homes of the painters whose names are now household\nwords.\n\nIt would have been well-nigh impossible for the little band to have\nchosen a more suitable spot for their labours. Rousseau and Millet,\nmuch as they were drawn towards each other by the tie of a sympathetic\ndisposition and by their common interest in art, yet were widely\ndissimilar from one another in their outlook upon art and their\nmethods of worship at the common shrine. Rousseau--one can see it from\nevery picture he painted--loved with all the yearning of a passionate\nand restless temperament the inanimate in Nature. Observe with what\nfidelity he draws his trees, with what caressing tenderness his clouds\nand skies are treated; solitude appealed to him above all things, and\nif here and there he was obliged to insert a few figures to complete\nhis composition, one instinctively feels that he would rather have\nsubstituted a group of cattle or a flock of sheep. In the glades of\nthe forest, far from the busy haunts of men, with the glorious\nsunlight penetrating from above, the breeze moaning through the\nbranches, he was happy. A wild and turbulent temperament such as his\nnot infrequently discovers exquisite enjoyment amidst such perfect\ntranquillity.\n\nBarbizon, situated on the fringe of the great forest of Fontainebleau,\ntherefore, permitted Rousseau to come into daily contact with the\nscenes which so appealed to him.\n\nMillet, on the other hand, was absorbed in the peasant. The man who\ntilled the soil and raised the produce humanity requires for its\nsubsistence by the sweat of his brow; the manifold duties of the\nlabourer, his life and sorrows, appealed to him with irresistible\nforce. An unpeopled track of wild and uncultivated land would not call\nforth any emotion in him, no matter how sublime the scenery might be.\n\nThe life of the village, spreading itself into the vast and fertile\nplain behind, held him absorbed; a peasant himself and living amongst\nthe people he so loved, he was in a position to bring before an\nunthinking world the poignant monotony of their useful lives.\n\nUpon their first arrival at Barbizon, the two artists put up at a\nsmall inn, working all day in a tiny place they had rented from some\npeasants and fitted up as a studio. The inconveniences of this\narrangement were soon apparent, and shortly afterwards Millet took a\nsmall house which was destined to be his abode for the remainder of\nhis life; an old barn in the immediate vicinity meanwhile provided him\nwith an excellent studio.\n\nFrom this period onward we must date the greatest productions of the\nmaster, the works which have induced more thought than those of any\nother peasant painter. A peasant among peasants, his life was of the\nmost rigid simplicity. Behind his little abode a large garden\nstretched away almost to the fringe of the forest itself, and here he\nwas accustomed to work every morning, growing a portion of the food\nnecessary to the sustenance of his family. The afternoon he devoted to\npainting, whilst the evening was given over to intercourse with his\nlittle circle of friends. The simplicity and tranquillity of his life\naroused the whole of his powers to action, and surrounded with\neverything he valued in life he was supremely happy.\n\nThe country around Barbizon appealed to him irresistibly. The\ntimber-studded plains, the gently undulating, highly cultivated\nfields, presented a strange contrast to the wild and rugged country\namidst which he had spent his childhood, and no doubt conduced to the\ndevelopment of a more refined and contemplative style than he would\notherwise have acquired. Upon his few visits to his native country he\nappears to have been more impressed than ever with its austerity, and\nthe drawings which these journeys called forth bore ample evidence of\nthis feeling in him.\n\nLack of the necessary funds to carry on even his simple m\u00e9nage was\never the bane of Millet's life. On many occasions Sensier, his\nintimate friend and afterwards his biographer, informs us he dissuaded\nhim from suicide.\n\nThe sums that he owed, small though they were, rendered him in\nconstant fear of the brokers. With creditors so importunate in their\ndemands for satisfaction, and with the constant lack of recognition,\nwhich was his lot, it is astonishing that Millet achieved so much. He\nwas relieved more than once by the kind-hearted and ever faithful\nRousseau, who when his friend was sorest pressed found some delicately\nhidden means to relieve him. It was he who acquired for 4000 francs\nthe wonderful \"Peasant grafting a Tree,\" when the picture failed to\nfind a purchaser; and in order that Millet should not be aware of his\ngenerosity, he made the offer in the name of an imaginary American.\n\nThis sort of goodness he repeated more than once, and it redounds\nstill more to his credit when we remember that Rousseau himself was\nnot infrequently in pecuniary difficulties.\n\nA constant succession of important works made their appearance during\nthe first ten years Millet spent at Barbizon. The first was the\nwell-known \"Sower,\" which has ever been one of the most popular of his\npictures. Then came the far finer \"Peasants going to Work,\" which for\nmany years was in an English Collection. The \"Gleaners,\" perhaps the\nnoblest canvas the master ever painted, dates from 1857, in which year\nit was seen at the Salon; the celebrated \"Angelus\" followed it two\nyears later. The prices which Millet obtained for this series of\nremarkable works was fantastically small. The \"Gleaners\" brought him a\npaltry 2000 francs, whilst he accounted himself lucky to encounter an\namateur who gave him the same sum for the small \"Woman feeding Fowls.\"\n\nThe \"Angelus,\" which was never exhibited, was sold in the year it was\npainted to a Monsieur Feydeau, an architect, for 1800 francs. It then\npassed through several hands before the late Monsieur Secr\u00e9tan\ncompeted up to 160,000 francs before he became possessed of the prize\nat the John Wilson sale.\n\nThe purchase, however, proved a sound investment, for upon the\ndispersal of his collection it was knocked down for 553,000 francs to\na Monsieur Proust, acting on behalf of the French Government. The\nlatter, however, when they gave the commission to buy the picture, had\nno idea that such a high value would be placed upon it, and\nconsequently refused to ratify the sale; a syndicate now came upon the\nscene, who took it to America. The price, however, proved greater than\neven the millionaires of the States were prepared to give, and the\ncanvas again returned to France, where it found a resting-place in the\ncollection of Monsieur Chauchard, who paid the enormous sum of 800,000\nfrancs for its possession.\n\nIn 1859 Millet sent two works to the Salon, a \"Woman grazing her Cow,\"\nand \"Death and the Woodman.\" The latter, one of the most\nphilosophical of Millet's pictures, which to-day is the principal\nattraction of the Jacobsen Museum at Copenhagen, was rejected.\n\nDisappointments of this kind came with such systematic regularity to\nthe painter that he must have become proof against them. He always had\nbitter enemies amongst the critics, who never failed to pour abuse\nupon his method and his subjects. Even a number of his fellow artists\njoined in the chorus of disapproval. But the vehemence with which he\nwas attacked was striking evidence of the impression he was making and\nthe inward sense of his own powers; and the fact that he was working\nout his destiny according to the dictates of his own genius supported\nhim against this outpouring of prejudice and malice. The social side\nof life appealed to him more strongly as the years rolled on, and the\nmurmurings which had been heard in 1859 as to the socialistic\ntendencies of \"Death and the Woodman\" swelled to a roar when the\nstupendous \"Man with the Hoe\" was exhibited fourteen years later. The\nlatter, one of the most virile studies of depraved humanity which the\nworld has ever seen, has always been a favourite with social\nreformers, and has inspired one remarkable poem. Even his most\nimplacable critics were disarmed before this canvas; its power was\nmagnetic; it was an inspiration, soul moving and trenchant.\n\nHis financial difficulties never completely dispersed. At one time, in\norder to insure himself a little tranquillity, he made a contract with\ntwo speculators, whereby they were to become possessors of all the\nwork he produced for three years, in consideration of their assuring\nhim a thousand francs a month. A great number of Millet's finest\nproductions passed thus through their hands, including the \"Return\nfrom the Fields\" and the \"Man with the Hoe.\" The partners were not\nlong in quarrelling, and after a lawsuit had been fought, Millet was\nleft in the hands of a man who frequently would not or could not pay\nhim in ready money, and whose bills he was frequently forced to\ndiscount at considerable loss.\n\nOne little gleam of sunshine rendered his later days happy. This was a\ncommission from a Colmar banker, Monsieur Thomas by name, who required\nfour allegorical compositions representing the Seasons, to decorate\nhis rooms. The artist was overjoyed by this piece of good fortune,\nand immediately commenced a most conscientious study of such mural\ndecoration as was within reach, in order that he might do full justice\nto his patron. He paid frequent visits to Fontainebleau and the\nLouvre, and even desired a friend to inquire if he could not obtain\nreproductions of the frescoes at Herculaneum and Pompeii. In spite of\nall this elaborate preparation, the subjects were not such as appealed\nto his genius, and in spite of them being well and soundly painted, we\nare told that they presented no features which called for special\ncomment.\n\nHe found, however, a much more genial occupation in accomplishing a\nseries of drawings ordered by a Monsieur Gavet, who paid the artist\n1000, 700, and 450 francs each, according to their size. He made\naltogether ninety-five drawings in this way, and it is said that this\ngentleman had in his possession the finest work in black and white and\nwater-colour the artist ever executed.\n\nTowards the latter end of his life the death of dear relatives and\nfriends cast a sorrowful gloom over him. Amongst the latter Rousseau,\nwho expired in his presence on the 22nd of December 1867, was\nperhaps the loss which seemed to him hardest to bear. A staunch and\ntrusty friend, who was to be relied upon when his prospects seemed the\nmost hopeless, he had been one of the very few who had appreciated\nMillet's talents at their full worth, and who, moreover, scanty as his\nown means were, was ever ready to stretch out his hand to assist his\nstruggling friend.\n\nShortly afterwards Millet paid a visit to his patron, Herr Hartmann,\nat M\u00fcnster, and from here he went for a short time into Switzerland.\n\nUpon his return he devoted himself with great earnestness to work, and\nachieved a certain success at the Salons with his exhibits. The\noutbreak of the war with Germany caused him to migrate with his family\nto Cherbourg, where he thought he might continue to work, removed as\nfar as possible from the scenes of carnage and struggle which were\ngoing on farther east. Transported once more amongst the scenes of his\nchildhood, he felt an increased impetus to production, and when he\nreturned to Barbizon late in 1871, he brought with him a number of\ncanvases of the highest quality; conspicuous amongst them was the\nwonderful \"Gr\u00e9ville Church,\" now in the Louvre.\n\nThe anxieties of his troublous life were, however, beginning to show\ntheir effect upon his constitution; a persistent cough developed, and\nalthough an amelioration would occasionally occur, it was always\nsucceeded by a worse condition than before. His health suffered a\ngeneral decline, and he finally breathed his last on the 20th of\nJanuary 1875. He was buried in the little cemetery of Chailly, beside\nhis friend Rousseau, amidst the scenery they both loved so well.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE MAN AND HIS ART\n\n\nMillet is an instance of an artist working out his own destiny,\nimpelled by irresistible genius, in the teeth of seemingly\ninsurmountable obstacles. He started life with enormous disadvantages;\nwithout friends in influential circles to spread his fame or plead his\ncause; without money to enable him to outlive and triumph over the\nignorant fanaticism of critics and artists, so soaked in the\nconventionalised art of their time that they had not perception enough\nto appreciate the full meaning of that naturalistic movement, which\nwas finally to sweep away the quasi-classic art they boasted of with\nsuch bombastic effusion. The path was hard and thorny, and his triumph\nwas not finally consummated until after his death. He himself found\nhis only satisfaction in the fact that he had lived his life according\nto the dictates of his genius, and had achieved the maximum of which\nhe was capable.\n\nMillet and our own Cotman were somewhat kindred spirits; there is much\nmore affinity between the work of the two men than is apparent to any\none who has not closely studied them. The marvellous \"Breaking the\nClod,\" now happily permanently housed at the British Museum, betrays\nthe same tremendous conception and broad outlook which characterises\nmany a drawing of Millet's. Both highly strung to a painful extent,\nthey were each conscious of their inability to curb the power which\nprescribed a certain course for them, and in spite of pecuniary\ndifficulties and unpopularity, an inevitable result of their intense\noriginality, they pursued a steady course to the end of their lives.\n\nThe socialistic doctrines which have been read into the work of Millet\nare rather the outcome of the world's uneasy conscience being brought\nface to face with a crushing indictment of existing conditions, than\nof any design on the artist's part to further the cause of a political\npropaganda by means of his art. This somewhat extravagant reading into\nhis art has certainly been carried to excess. Particularly has such\nbeen the case in America, where a large number of his finest works are\nat present to be found, curiously enough in the hands of enormously\nwealthy people, who are frequently perhaps the least able to\nunderstand the real meaning of his message.\n\nComing from a peasant stock, his sympathies were always with the\npeasant; it was the only class he understood or cared for. He lived as\none of them, and shared to a large extent in their labour. He has been\ndesignated, not inappropriately, the philosopher in sabots. Rightly or\nwrongly he has come to be looked upon as one of the high priests of\ncommunistic doctrines. Few pictures have been so anathematised as the\n\"Man with the Hoe,\" and perhaps none have done more to inculcate\nsympathy with the degradation of the lower orders of the human race.\n\nThe revolting brutality and vacancy of that face haunts the\nimagination. Is it possible that fellow-creatures so utterly debased\nby toil and neglect exist? Millet dispels any doubt upon the question\nby bequeathing to humanity this trenchant portrait. By no means\nlimited to Barbizon or France, these poor creatures exist in every\ncountry, and curiously enough are considered an essential element in\neach country's development.\n\nThis poignantly human note is observable in almost every work Millet\nwrought; his passionate sympathy with his fellow-man is the keynote of\nhis art. The wood-cutter in his arduous toil, the shepherd in his\nsolitariness, the labourer turning the soil with unvarying and\nlaborious monotony, the mother caring for her children--all carry the\nsame message for him of that strange and incomprehensible mingling of\njoy and sadness we call life. Like many great minds before and since\nhis time, our artist found the greatest joy in life in a placid and\nnever changing melancholy. But the peasants he chose knew nothing of\nthe sadness he saw in them. Completely inured to their toil, and\nsubdued by it, with no refining or uplifting influence to stimulate\nthem, they knew nothing, aspired to nothing beyond what they were; it\nwas left to Millet to supply the \"might have been.\" He saw the inky\nblackness of the mind of the \"Man with the Hoe,\" the pathetic\ninequality between the mounted farmer directing the safe storage of\nhis crop, and the stooping figures of the \"Gleaners\" eager to scrape\nup the miserable crumbs which had fallen from the rich man's table. He\ntraced the lives of these simple folk until we arrive at the grim and\ngaunt figure of Death, who, as he grasps the woodman by the shoulder,\nreminds him that his course is finished and that he, in common with\nall his fellow-men, must enter the great unknown land from which there\nis no return. It is a sad and melancholy art, vibrating with purity\nand truth, the outpouring of a great soul yearning to express itself\nto the utmost of its power. The mind and character of the man can be\nread in every line and in every touch of the brush. His drawings and\netchings are even more searching in their virility than his pictures.\n\nThere is a spontaneousness about them we search for in vain in his\nwork in oil and pastel. In black and white his intensely emotional\nmind found a swift method of expression; in the laboriousness of oil\npainting he was fettered with the complications of the medium. It can\nbe fairly said that only in one or two paintings--a notable example\ncan be cited in the wondrous \"Sawyers\" at South Kensington--does he\nrise to the height of a great painter. Millet was a poet, a\nphilosopher, a great thinker, and the means he chose for expressing\nhimself were those which were best fitted to his purpose. His\npredilections in art were concentrated upon the greatest, and\nconsequently the men who appealed to him were the thinkers of the\nages. Mantegna and Correggio, Michel Angelo and the mighty Greeks,\nthese were the masters who left their impress upon his mind and art.\n\nThe influence of so sincere and profound an artist has necessarily\nbeen profound. He has moulded men who have achieved world-wide fame;\nSegantini, for example, would never have risen to the heights he did\nhad the example of Millet not been ever before him. There have been\nmany who, without possessing his genius, have endeavoured to follow\nin his footsteps, but successfully as his imitators have sometimes\ncaught his style, their productions can never live alongside his,\nbecause they lack the real ring of sincerity.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n        a. One bed, or folding cot,\n        b. One oil stove,\n        c. One lamp,\n        d. Enough supplies of all kinds sufficient for six months,\n        e. Pots, pans, kettles, etc.\nIt is needless to say that positions in Manila and Iloilo were now at\na premium.\n\nWas it possible that teachers were to be sent to places where even the\nnecessaries of life could not be obtained! Was it possible that many\nwould be sent to places so remote that for six months no fresh\nsupplies could be gotten! A mass meeting was held at once, and a\ncommittee was appointed to send a cablegram to the Associated Press\npetitioning aid from the American people at large. Realizing what\nconsternation would be created throughout the United States by such a\nmessage, two of the teachers leaped into a carriage at the close of\nthe meeting and a few moments later were closeted with the chief\nexecutive of the department. As a result the committee was persuaded\nnot to send the cablegram to the Associated Press until by courtesy it\nhad been sent to the President. Of course, this diplomatic move tided\naffairs over and the teachers who had flatly refused to budge from\nManila now agreed to go on to their stations, being assured that\nwhatever action was best would be taken.\n\nThe day had come when we must separate. We were to enter an untried\nand an unknown field. It was fitting that we have a final joyous\nmeeting, so the best orchestra in the archipelago was engaged and we\n\"chased the hours with flying feet\" until dawn so that whatever might\ncome to us in that unknown future upon which we were entering each\nwould hold in pleasant memory our last evening together.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER III. - A DRAMA IN ACTUAL LIFE.\n\n\nAlmost every one heeded the warning to go to his station forearmed\nwith at least necessaries of life, but, as it had never fallen to the\nlot of the writer to cook, he refused to learn at that late day, so he\ntook no pot, no pan, no kettle, putting his future into the hands of\nan uncertain fate and relying upon the unknown hospitality of the\nFilipino.\n\nBacalod, the capital of the province of Occidental Negros, was our\ndestination. The second morning after leaving Manila, we awoke with\nthe \"Kilpatrick\" lying at anchor in a shallow bay. We were several\nmiles from the shore and nothing in sight indicated that we had\nreached a place of any importance. Late the night before we had been\nawakened by the loud, sharp ringing of the ship's bells, accompanied\nby the reversal of the engines and a general disturbance awaking the\ncrew. So our first impressions on coming on deck were that we had run\naground. But the captain assured us that everything was ship-shape and\nthat this was the nearest point of approach to Capiz, a town of\nconsiderable importance on the island of Panay, where a body of troops\nwas to embark for home. Not even the grass hut of a native was in\nsight. Search as we would, not a sign was seen of a stream flowing\ninto the sea, indicating the probable presence of a town. There was\nnot a sign of life of any kind save one lone column of thin, blue\nsmoke that arose from the side of a mountain miles away. One would\nhave thought that we were explorers of three hundred years ago lying\noff the shore of some unknown land.\n\nAfter breakfast the steam launch, together with all the boats, was\nlowered, and several of us who had determined to miss no opportunity\nto gather information about the islands took our places in the launch\nby the side of the ship's mate, and steamed away across the water with\na long line of boats strung out in the rear. We headed away toward a\ngroup of cocoanut trees, and about an hour later stepped ashore on a\npile of decayed coral rocks that extended some twenty or thirty feet\nout into the water, thus forming the only landing place of a town of\nseveral thousands of people and of considerable commercial importance.\n\nA few moments after we had landed, an army wagon drawn by a\nmagnificent pair of mules came up out of a tropical jungle along a\nnarrow road. We clambered into the wagon and were soon lost in the\ndepths of foliage from which we had just seen the vehicle emerge.\n\nLong waving bamboos with their plumy leafage hung over the road from\neach side, meeting and overlapping in the center until they formed an\narchway so dense that the tropical sun now high in the heavens\npenetrated it only at intervals. At times the wagon sank up to the\nhubs in the soft earth, and the muscles of the mules stood out like\nwhip-cords under the skin as they drew us forward.\n\nAt a sharp turn in the road we came upon the first division of troops\nthat was to embark for home. The look of joy upon their sun-browned\nfaces was inexpressible. Their work was done, and with elastic step\nand smiling faces they saluted us as they passed by. The reign of\nforce was at an end; it was going out with them; the reign of peace\nhad begun; it was coming in with us.\n\nIn the afternoon when we returned from the town the last of the troops\nhad arrived and, as we drove up, the bugle was sounding the call to\nsupper. We noticed native women mingling with the troops and, indeed,\na native woman was in constant attention waiting upon one of the\nsoldiers with whom we ate. Her clothes were clean, her hair was nicely\ncombed, and her general appearance was neat. She seemed to anticipate\nthe slightest wish of the soldier with whom she was. She brought him\nwater to drink, cleaned his plate after the meal and saw that his\nknife, fork, and spoon were put into his haversack.\n\nWe had now finished supper and the launch had returned for the last\nload of troops. The lieutenant in command of the company gave the\norder to \"fall in\"; the men shouldered their rifles and fell into\nline. \"Forward, march!\" called the lieutenant, and the column swept\nforward towards the boats. The women had until now restrained\nthemselves, but, as their husbands marched away never to return, their\nfeelings could no longer be restrained. One young woman of about\neighteen, who was leaning against a rock by the roadside sobbing, when\nher husband passed, leaped up in frenzy of passionate love and caught\nthe rifle from his shoulder. Her first impulse seemed to be to throw\nthe gun away, but suddenly realizing the futility of such an act she\nburst into tears, shouldered the rifle herself and marched on by his\nside. Another woman of more mature age threw her arms around the legs\nof a tall stalwart man, and drew him bodily from the line.\n\nBut the troops marched on and entered the boats. One woman who had\nbeen unnoticed before came down into the shallow water and caught hold\nof our last boat as if to prevent its leaving, while others stood\nmingling their sobs with the sounds of the wavelets as they broke on\nthe sands. As we passed away, an expectant mother, standing in bold\noutline against the twilight sky, threw up her hands in an agony of\ndespair and then sank upon the stones. The curtain had fallen upon a\ndrama in actual life deeper in pathos than any other we had ever seen\nor ever expected to see. Depth of passion, depth of love! Who can\nfathom the human heart?\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. - WHAT THE TEACHERS DID.\n\n\nThere is a remarkable sameness about the towns in the Philippines.\n\nThey all have a large open square about the middle of the town, around\nthree sides of which are Chinese stores, unless one side lies open to\nthe sea, and on the fourth is the great stone ecclesia. The streets\nrun at right angles to one another and divide up the town into\ncreditable squares.\n\nEverybody in the Philippines lives up-stairs, for the ground is so\nsoaked with water during the rainy season that it is a menace to\nhealth to live upon the ground floor. So even the poorest nippa hut\nis built upon stakes four or five feet above the ground.\n\nBacalod is a typical Philippine town. As we landed, a broad open\nsquare was spread out before us. Two sides of the square were lined\nwith two-story houses in which were Chinese stores below and Filipino\nhomes above. On the third side stood the great stone church in whose\nmassive tower the clock was striking the hour of four, while the\nfourth lay open to the sea that had borne us thither.\n\nWe landed, but it was in a method new to us and one not usually\nemployed by the traveling public.\n\nWhen our sail boat ran aground on the sandy bottom a hundred yards or\nmore from the shore, a crowd of Filipino men who were on the beach\nslowly rolled up their pantaloons and waded out to the rescue,--for\nthe money that was in it. The boat's crew elevated their trousers'\nlegs also and slided down into the water. Each of us then straddled\nthe neck of a Filipino standing in the water and was held by ankles to\nbe steadied while our biped mounts proceeded to the shore.\n\nWe were now on the ground and face to face with the situation. To give\nthe reader an idea of the actual conditions met by the first teachers\nwho went to the Islands, the following is copied from the instructions\ngiven us in Manila:\n    1. There shall be two sessions daily of all schools, and the\n    last hour of the morning session shall be devoted solely to\n    instructing the Filipino teachers.\n\n    2. In cases where teachers are sent to a town in which there\n    is no school-house, they are expected to secure the aid of the\n    people and have one built.\n\n    3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is\n    stopped.\n\n    4. All supplies must be kept under lock and key. In towns\n    where there is no case or box to lock the supplies in, and it\n    is also impossible to get the town council to furnish a case,\n    a requisition may be sent to Manila, and, if an appropriation\n    can be secured, one will be made and sent out.\n\nThus it can be easily seen that we were indeed pioneers. In many\nplaces no school-house was to be found, and in some cases it was even\ndifficult to get the town council to provide a case in which to keep\nthe supplies.\n\nThe work of the teachers was, in short; to \"make the English language\nthe basis of instruction in the public schools.\" On our arrival at\nBacalod two schools were found in progress, for some soldiers had been\ndetailed for the work here previous to our coming. One of these was\nfor boys and the other, for girls. Thus the work here had been in a\nmeasure simplified, but complications that had arisen at Talisay, one\nof the largest and richest towns on the island, demanded a change of\nteachers and the writer was assigned to the place as superintendent.\n\nHere an attempt had been made to start a school but it had failed\nignominiously and a system of education was to be put into operation\nfrom the very start.\n\nThe Filipinos are not strong advocates of co-education, so separate\nschools were to be started for the boys and the girls. The one for the\nboys was gotten well in hand before the one for the girls was\nattempted at all.\n\nA few days after reaching the town and securing a home the\npresidente of the town had it publicly announced that the following\nMonday morning at eight o'clock a public school for boys would be\nopened in a building that had been rented for the purpose by the\nmunicipal council. About the middle of the afternoon of the same day a\nman beat a little drum throughout all the streets of the town to call\nthe people out and the town clerk announced both in Spanish and in the\nnative language that this public school would begin at the time and\nplace mentioned above; that instruction would be free to all who came;\nthat the government would furnish all supplies; and that instruction\nwould be given in the English language. A native principal and\nassistants were employed and everything was ready to begin.\n\nThe official report of the result is as follows:\n    Boys' public school of Talisay, Negros, P. I., began November\n    4, 1901. Forty-three boys present at eight o'clock. Forty-one\n    of them knew \"good morning\" and \"good afternoon\" but do not\n    know the distinction between them. Two of them speak simple\n    Spanish. At eight forty-five, eight more, who had been\n    attending an early morning private school, came in together.\n\n    The books they brought were so varied and so different from\n    one another that it seemed impossible to bring any reasonable\n    degree of order out of such a chaos, and so, after struggling\n    vainly for about a week with the problem, the superintendent\n    by one fell stroke removed everything in use and put in a\n    uniform system, and from that day on the English language has\n    been the basis of instruction in the public schools of\n    Talisay. The work was of necessity very slow at first, but by\n    the end of a year two schools were going nicely and a number\n    of the brightest boys and girls had made really excellent\n    progress.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER V. - A \"BAILE.\"\n\n\nNot long after the arrival of our party at Bacalod we received an\ninvitation to a \"baile\" given in our honor by the inhabitants of\nSilay, a town some ten or twelve miles up the northern coast and one\nnoted for its social life. The invitation was accepted with pleasure,\nand about the middle of the afternoon on the day appointed we were\nclad in the immaculate white of the tropics and steaming away up the\ncoast on board a launch sent for our conveyance. Twilight was still\nlingering on the path of day when we anchored just off shore at the\ntown. A row-boat containing the officials of the city came out to meet\nus and, in due season, we were ushered into a spacious drawing-room\nfilled almost to overflowing with the \u00e9lite of the town. The \u00e9lite of\ntowns in the Philippines speak Spanish, and, as only one or two of our\nparty could at that time boast of more than a formal acquaintance with\nthe Castilian tongue, the exchange of ideas that evening between us\nand the Filipinos was of necessity not very rapid.\n\nThe necessity of easy communication between us was rendered somewhat\nless indispensable by the announcement of supper as soon as we were\nrested from our trip. When we had taken our places at the table a\nyoung Filipino about twenty-five years of age arose and gave a lengthy\ntoast to the recent union of the Philippines with the United States.\n\nBut as we Americans were unable to scale the dizzy heights of his\nclimaxes or sink to the depths of his pathos, we forewent the\npleasures of his oratory and turned our attention to the savory odor\nof lamb, chicken, and roast pig that came slyly stealing up our\nnostrils to send us nerve dispatches about the gastronomic delights of\nour not far distant future.\n\nAt last the toast was ended and the world-wide soup ushered in a long\ntrain of things good to eat, served in a style better fitted to the\ndelights of the appetite than to the formalities of dinners, for, as\nsoon as the pleasant task of one dish was completed by any one, the\nnext was served him at once regardless of the progress made by the\nothers at the table.\n\nThe last course was dulce. The new-comers to the Philippines will\nnot be long in making the acquaintance of this dish, and at all\nmeetings, both public and private, where eatables are served, it\nperforms an important part. It is anything sweet, and it may vary all\nthe way from an india-rubber-like black mixture of cocoanut milk and\ndirty sugar to a really toothsome and respectable confection. No\nmatter of what materials a dish is composed, just so long as it is\nsweet, it is dulce.\n\nAfter paying our respects to this last course, we arose from the table\nand entered a great rectangular room from the center of whose ceiling\nhung a large glass chandelier, a mass of shimmering crystals. In the\nchairs around the room were the wealth, the youth, and the beauty of\nthe town.\n\nThe first and also the last number of every Filipino dance of any\nformality is the \"rigodon.\" The dancers are arranged in a square, or\nquadrangle according to the number participating, and are then led\nthrough a tangled maze of figures that so utterly bewilders the novice\nthat he sinks into his chair at the end of the dance wondering how it\nall came to pass.\n\nWe Americans breathed a sigh of relief when the \"rigodon\" ended, and\nmustered fresh courage for social conquests in the waltz that was now\nbreathing forth from the trembling strings. My companion in the first\ndance had been the young lady by whose side I had sat at dinner. But\nit now became necessary to search for another, so I prudently waited\nto see how partners were chosen, and made no mistake when a few\nmoments later I faced one of the most luscious looking se\u00f1oritas on\nthe opposite side of the room and offered her my arm. My eyes must\nhave told the story that my lips could not utter in Spanish, for she\nsmiled upon me sweetly, arose, and put her hand upon my shoulder. My\narm encircled her waist and I began to waltz. Unfortunately my\ncompanion did not follow, but began to hop up and down in a manner\nmost distressing. Supposing the attack to be only temporary, I paused\nand, much to my relief, she soon showed signs of recovery; and in the\ncourse of time she came to a standstill looking up into my face in an\ninquiring sort of way, apparently wondering why St. Vitus had not paid\nhis respects to me also. A second attempt to follow the music met with\nresults similar to the first, and during the third attempt, which\nseemed to be trembling on the verge of a failure, St. Vitus let go my\ncompanion and seized me with such vigor that she, who was small even\nfor a Filipino, was gathered up bodily and taken around the room at\nsuch a pace that her toes touched the floor only at far distant\nintervals.\n\nAt this point my devotion to the shrine of Terpsichore ceased from\nforce of circumstances and I seated myself in one of the most\ncomfortable chairs in sight that I might carry out a previously formed\nplan to study the Filipino somewhat critically as he appears in\nsociety.\n\nThe first thing that impressed me as the dancers passed up and down\nthe room was the flash of diamonds. Nearly every woman in the room had\non a brooch that flashed the colors of the rainbow at every turn.\n\nAlmost all of them wore one or more rings that showed up brilliantly\nunder the chandelier. Many of the men too, especially the young men,\nwore gems that appeared to be exquisite. A closer inspection showed\nthat some of the gems had flaws and others were of a poor color, but\nno one would have denied that, taken as a whole, it was a really\nbeautiful display.\n\nThe dress of the ladies was richly colored. Many of their skirts were\nof silk covered with hand embroidered flowers, and their filmy pina\nwaists and broad collar pieces were rich with needle-work. They all\nwore a kind of heelless velvet slipper, very common as a dress shoe in\nthe Philippines, or high-heeled patent leather shoes with neatly\nfitting black stockings.\n\nThe men were dressed in white coats and white pantaloons or black\ncoats and white pantaloons. White shirts and collars, together with\nall sorts and styles of cravats and low-cut patent leather shoes with\nhighly colored socks completed their dress.\n\nIt was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money;\nthat they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a\ntable loaded with good things was a fact to which all of us were\nenthusiastic witnesses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VI. - A SKETCH OF LIFE IN THE PHILIPPINES.\n\n\nHouse-keeping in the Philippines presents some interesting phases. Our\nclub of American officials decided to run a mess, so we employed a\ncook and a house boy, then each of us provided himself with a personal\nservant, making a total of six servants for four men--it takes about\nthis proportion of servants to live in any sort of comfort in the\nPhilippines--and launched ourselves boldly upon the sea of domestic\neconomy. But there were shoals ahead of us, for the question of\nregulating servants is one of no small importance in the Philippines,\nand one of its most disadvantageous features is the long chain of\ndependents that usually attends it.\n\nWe gave the cooks so much a day with which to buy supplies in the\nlocal market, for our own table, making him render a daily list of\nexpenditures, and a fixed amount besides to purchase rice and fish for\nhimself and the other servants. Of course, if they wished to vary\ntheir diet and get chicken and fresh pork, which could be had at far\ndistant intervals, it was wholly a matter of their option, but the\nallowance was made on the basis of so much rice and fish a day for\neach. This allowance was about fifteen cents a day in Spanish coin per\nservant.\n\nThus far all was well. We had agreed to give the cook eight dollars a\nmonth in Spanish money, thinking that good wages would procure good\nservice, but the visions of affluence that floated before him on such\nfloods of wealth were so alluring that they drew him from the kitchen\nto the cooler veranda. In less than a week he had employed an\nassistant at four dollars a month; in less than another week that\nassistant had employed him an assistant at two dollars a month; in\nless than another week that assistant to the assistant had employed\nhim an assistant at the princely salary of fifty cents a month; and\nfrom fear that the chain of dependents would end only by our having\nthe whole Filipino race attached to our culinary force, we broke up\nhouse-keeping and went boarding again, choosing that as the less of\nthe two evils.\n\nOur house furnishings were almost wholly Philippine. The table ware\nand the food on the table came from the ends of the earth. The knives\nand forks were made in Germany, the plates were manufactured in\nEngland, the glass ware and table cloth, in the United States. The\noatmeal and flour came from the United States also. The butter came\nfrom Australia, the rice from China, the salt from Russia, and the\nother eatables from sources about as various as their separate names.\n\nSwitzerland furnished the condensed milk and Illinois the canned\ncream. Nearly all of the canned fruit bore labels from Spain.\n\nThus it can easily be seen that life in the Philippines, if lived\naccording to American ideals, is dependent upon a highly developed and\nhighly complex commerce. However, the difficulties of transportation\nand the restriction of large stocks of merchandise to Manila and some\nhalf a dozen other towns, make so great a difference between country\nlife and city life that a short comparison of the two will not be out\nof place, and life in Manila may well be taken as being fairly typical\nof the latter.\n\nLife in Manila is pleasant, but expensive. It is pleasant from the\nfact that it is not only the capital but also metropolis of the\narchipelago. Thus the combination of wealth and high official position\nhas given to Manila a society of the highest and most refined type.\n\nThe process of beautifying and improving the city which is constantly\ngoing on bids fair to give us at no distant day a city of which we may\nwell be proud.\n\nBut let him who intends living well in Manila on a small income bid\nfarewell at once to so idylic a dream, for it costs much to live well\nthere. In the city of Manila one can get almost anything he wishes,\nbut it must be paid for at the price it commands. Especially in the\ncase of eatables, this price is by no means small, because to the\nfirst cost of articles must in most cases be added the expense of\ndistant shipment from American, European, or Australian ports, and not\ninfrequently the cost of long refrigeration must also be taken into\nconsideration. But, expensive though it is, it is very pleasant to\nlive there and those who have once enjoyed it often wish again to\nquaff the cup of its delights.\n\nIn strong contrast to this pleasant life is the life of the quiet\nlittle hamlet away in the distant islands. Indeed, the Filipino from\nthe distant town, who by some good fortune has been to Manila, or, by\na coup de main, has studied in one of the Manila colleges, is looked\nup to in a true hero-worshiping attitude by all who either know him or\nhear of his fame. Life in such a place is one long state of harmless\ninactivity. Not a wave of trouble from the great outer world ever\ndisturbs its peaceful repose. One lounges forever in an air of\nindolent ease and extreme aversion to anything approaching what might\nbe called a respectable effort.\n\nOne arises in the morning about the time the sun's first rays silver\nthe top leaves of the cocoanut trees and then stirs around until nine\nor ten o'clock, when it is found expedient to avoid a further exposure\nto the sun. From then until about five o'clock in the afternoon it is\nbest to take things as they come, even though one of those things be a\nFilipino dinner. But then you may have your vehiclo attached to a\nyoung bull with a ring in his nose and go for a drive. If it is the\ndry season you will probably enjoy the drive unless you object to the\nfrequent clouds of dust swept along by the evening wind. If it is in\nthe rainy season your pleasure will depend to a considerable extent\nupon how wet you get; but, whether the season be wet or dry, your\npleasure will be regulated largely by the state of harmony existing\nbetween the driver and the bull.\n\nIn these quiet secluded nooks successive generations of Filipinos are\nborn, reared, grow old and die in an even chain of events broken only\nby the occasional erection of a new grass house on the identical spot\nwhere its predecessors have stood for ages. The son lives in the house\nof his father, cultivates the same few square feet of soil planted in\nedible roots, climbs the same cocoanut trees, follows the same winding\npath down to the stream, pounds rice in the same mortar and with the\nsame stick that his ancestors have used from time unremembered, and,\nin case of illness, curls up on a grass mat in a corner of the room\nuntil he dies or by some good fortune recovers. Beyond this narrow\nhorizon he never looks. So narrow and contracted is the life that the\nlanguages of two towns a few miles apart are so different that one\nwould scarcely recognize them as belonging to the same race of people.\n\nSuch are the two extremes of life in our new far Eastern provinces:\nthe one is active, progressive, and cosmopolitan; the other, inactive,\ndecadent, and narrow; but, whether one enjoys the first or endures the\nsecond, there comes to him after leaving a longing to lounge again in\ntropic airs and listen to the lullaby of the winds among the palms.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VII. - THE FILIPINO AT HOME.\n\n\nAs one enters a Filipino sitting-room for the first time, there is one\nfeature in the arrangement of the furniture that impresses itself upon\nhim at once, and it may be stated without fear of serious\ncontradiction that this same peculiar feature in its arrangement will\ncontinue to face him, as he enters different homes, about as certainly\nas he crosses the threshold.\n\nThe arrangement referred to is that of one large mirror, one settee,\nand some ten or a dozen chairs that appear to have had a certain\norderly affection for one another. The mirror is hung upon one of the\nlarge interior parts of the house about four feet above the floor. The\nwooden houses in the Philippines are built by setting large posts\nupright into the ground, extending into the air from twenty to thirty\nfeet. Cross timbers are fastened to these upright posts about eight or\nten feet above the ground and then not sawed off even with the posts,\nbut allowed to extend beyond them each way. The framework of the house\nis built upon these extending cross timbers, a style of building by\nwhich these large upright posts are left standing out on the inside of\nthe room from one to three feet from the walls. It is on that one of\nthese posts most nearly opposite the door that the mirror always finds\nits place. Immediately beneath the mirror is the settee; and the\nchairs are arranged in two parallel lines facing one another and at\nright angles with the ends of the settee. However odd this arrangement\nmay appear to one when he first enters a Filipino drawing-room, there\nare two things to be said in its favor. In the first place, it places\nyou face to face with the person with whom you are conversing so that\nyou can watch him,--a matter of no small moment in the Philippines. In\nthe next place, it enables you to give one of the young ladies a\nsheep's-eye in the mirror while the others present are left where\nMoses was in our much abused conundrum.\n\nThe size of the residence and the quality of its furnishings depends\nupon the wealth of the owner. But there is so vast a difference\nbetween the mode of life of the highest class and the tao, or lowest\nclass, that it is well to speak of them separately, and the great\nmiddle class of Filipinos can easily be imagined to occupy the\nintervening ground.\n\nThe rich Filipino's house is usually of wood built upon a wall of\nstone or brick from ten to fifteen feet high. The floors are kept\nhighly polished in his hallway, dressing-room, and bed-rooms. There\nare, of course, no fire-places in any of the rooms, but on some\noccasions something is needed to dry the rain-soaked atmosphere, for\neven in the dry season it has been seen to rain for five successive\ndays and nights without the cessation of a moment.\n\nA long chain of dependents is attached to the household of the rich\nFilipino. The master has his special body servant to be present at all\ntimes to do his master's bidding, in short, to be the visible\nmechanism of his master's volition. So, too, the lady of the house has\nher servant woman to do the slightest bidding of her ladyship. Then\nthere is the cook who is almost invariably a man, a house boy or two,\nand the coachman. These functionaries, with their assistants and\nassistants to the assistants, together with a servant or two for the\nexclusive service of the children, complete the economic household.\n\nSuch a family has an abundance of rice and wheat bread, also of\nchicken and fish with occasional fresh beef. They have also a good\ndeal of dulce. They regularly serve wine and frequently serve beer\non their tables.\n\nIn strong contrast with this mode of life is that of the tao. His\ndiet consists almost wholly of rice and small uncleaned fish boiled\ntogether. As a rule knife, fork, plate, and spoon find no place in his\nhousehold. The rice and fish are boiled in a pot and then allowed to\ncool in the same vessel or poured out to cool in a large earthen or\nwooden bowl. Then Mr. Tao together with Mrs. Tao and all the young\nTaos squat on their heels around the mixture and satisfy that\nintangible thing called the appetite. They do not use chop sticks as\nthe Chinese do, but the rice and fish are caught in a hollow formed by\nthe first three fingers of the right hand. The thumb is then placed\nbehind the mass. It is raised up and poised before the mouth, with a\nskill coming from the evolution of ages, when a contraction of the\nmuscles of the thumb throws the mass into the mouth with a skill that\nis marvelous to any but a Filipino. To judge from the most reliable\ninformation, the poorest class do not have an abundance of food,\nalthough it would seem that such a condition of things would be\nwell-nigh impossible. However, in a census of one hundred school\nchildren there were found six boys and four girls who declared that\nthey had never had enough to eat, and the native teacher stated that\nthis was probably true.\n\nThe wide gulf between the tao and the rich man is filled by the\ngreat middle class of Filipinos.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VIII. - VISIT TO A LEPER COLONY.\n\n\nNot far from our town was a leper colony and the first Saturday that\ncould be spared was set aside for a trip to the place. It happened\nthat none of the other Americans were at leisure on this particular\nmorning, but, rather then delay the trip or miss it altogether, the\nwriter, armed with a revolver, started out alone.\n\nThe road had been described so accurately by one who was supposed to\nknow it that it was deemed well-nigh impossible to miss the way. The\nmain highway was followed to the point where the by-path supposed to\nlead to the settlement turned off through some bamboo thickets and a\nlow tropical wood. This path led straight away towards the sea-coast\nwhere the houses of the colony were said to stand in a cocoanut grove\nby the beach.\n\nUpon arriving at the settlement, a very inhospitable reception was\nreceived from a mangy cur that growled and showed a very uninviting\nset of sharp, white teeth behind his snarling lips. The growling of\nthe dog had attracted the attention of an old man who, with age-bent\nback, was pounding rice in a mortar about fifty yards away. He turned\nslowly around and, upon seeing an intruder into the primitive quiet of\nthe place, gave a sharp, far-reaching call. The sound had scarcely\nrung through the grove when from about a dozen of the little grass\nhouses dotted here and there fifteen or twenty men armed with bolos\ncame out and gathered around the old man. A sense of my danger flashed\nupon me. Three miles from town and alone in a tropical jungle, I could\nbe almost instantly overcome by this band of bolo-men, and the only\nreport that would ever reach my people would be that I had\n\"disappeared.\" Of course, attack was by no means certain, but the\npotentiality of the situation was thrilling. A drawn revolver and the\ngleaming of its shining barrel had the effect of stopping the men, who\nseemed to be hesitating as to a course of action, until a somewhat\ndignified retreat was made to an open space in the rear from where a\nless dignified and a more hasty retreat began which did not stop short\nof Bacalod.\n\nEnough had been seen, however, even in this short visit, to give\nconvincing proof that the settlement visited was no colony of lepers;\nso, that afternoon two servant boys being taken as guides and\ninterpreters, another attempt was made to reach the goal desired.\n\nThis attempt was successful, and, after about two hours of walking, a\nlittle cluster of grass huts snugly hidden by the sea-coast came into\nview. As we approached, one would have thought it a gala-day. Some few\nchildren, apparently from six to thirteen years of age, almost wholly\nnude, were romping and playing in the open space around which the huts\nstood, and no one would ever have thought that any cloud so horrible\nas leprosy could hover over a place apparently so happy.\n\nBy the side of the path as we passed was a man and his wife setting\nout potato plants. His hands were so puffed and his fingers so short\nthat he could scarcely use them, but he was working along as best he\ncould. His wife's feet were so swollen and twisted that she walked\nonly with the greatest difficulty. We passed them by and entered the\nopen space above referred to.\n\nThe children now saw us, and those of them who could darted away like\nfrightened rabbits, each to his own burrow. An old man who was sitting\nin the warm afternoon sun on the little bamboo platform before his hut\nwas aroused from his lethargic repose by the scampering away of the\nchildren. He arose, trembling upon his tottering limbs, all drawn and\ntwisted, and hobbled away into his hut.\n\nThe children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at\nthe doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of\nthe settlement. In a few moments we were surrounded by a circle of\nhuman beings at once so repulsive and so pitiable that its graphic\nvividness can never be accurately portrayed.\n\nThe old man referred to above, having put on a pair of snow-white\npantaloons, appeared now at the doorway of his hut, followed a few\nmoments later by his wife who had evidently clothed herself in the\nbest raiment she had. At a call from the old man, all the men, women,\nand children in the settlement came out of their huts and stood in a\nline before us. The old man was spokesman and in his native visayan\ntongue made a heart-rending appeal for aid which we were powerless to\ngive. Attention was called to a leper woman, apparently about\ntwenty-five years of age, whose face had been attacked by the disease\nand whose appearance was truly pathetic. Upon her hip was a child\nabout a year and a half old and, strange to say, the child showed as\nyet no signs whatever of the disease.\n\nWhat an indissoluble enigma is life! Here in a little cluster of grass\nhuts in a secluded nook of a secluded island of an all but secluded\narchipelago was gathered together a little community of wretched\nnatives, driven by their loathsomeness from association with others\neven of the same half-savage race. Yet here, men and women loved and\nwere married, by mutual trust if not by law, and children were born of\nthe union to live forever under the unspeakable horror that\novershadowed the unfortunate parents. Love, hatred, sorrow, and\njoy--every passion that enters into the complex structure of the human\nheart even here, in this scene of sadness and despair, was playing\napparently as freely as where misfortune and disease had never crossed\nthe portals of life.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER IX. - A \"HIKE.\"\n\n\nWe were lounging lazily in our hammocks at Jimamaylan one evening in\nApril. Supper was just ended, and the soldiers in the post were\ncollected in groups here and there spinning yarns to pass away the\ntime, when a Filipino clad only in a loin cloth came down the street\nat a steadily swinging run and stopped in front of the sentry. He\nbrought the announcement that a band of ladrones had just burned a\nsugar mill and were advancing to sack a barrio about fifteen miles\naway.\n\nThe invitation of the commanding officer to go on a \"hike\" was eagerly\naccepted, and, in ten minutes after the message was given, the troops\nwere on the march followed by two adventurous pedagogues.\n\nDarkness was just closing in as we left the town, but a resplendent\ntropic moon soon made the night almost as brilliant as the day. The\ntrail we followed led over rough and rocky country. Sometimes for a\ndistance of a mile or more we passed over barren wastes of volcanic\nslag poured out in anger by some peak whose convulsions have long\nsince ceased. Again we would descend into a tropical jungle from the\ndense foliage of which the ladrones could have leaped at any moment,\nhad they known of our coming, and annihilated our little band. We\nforded rapid streams with the water at our breasts, and halted only\nonce in that rapid march of fifteen miles.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the town we met a man who was standing\nguard against a surprise by the ladrones. Nothing could well have been\nmuch more grotesque and nothing could much better illustrate the\nabsolutely primitive condition of the Filipinos in the interior of the\nislands than the appearance of this guard. A pair of knee pants, a\nconical grass hat, and a hemp shirt formed his entire apparel. A long\nflat wooden shield, a bolo, and a long bamboo spear with a sharp,\nflat, iron point, completed his equipment for battle.\n\nHere stood the first and the twentieth centuries side by side. The\nFilipino who had advanced only a stage beyond the condition of\nprimitive man with his knife, spear, and wooden shield, stood side by\nside with the American soldier, a representative of modern life with\nhis magazine rifle, his canteen, his knapsack,--with every article of\nhis clothing made to give him the highest possible efficiency as the\nunit of a military organization.\n\nA few yards farther on we met another guard equipped similarly to the\nfirst. Upon reaching the town, news had just been received that a\ndetachment of troops from another post had intercepted the ladrones\nand fought a skirmish with them. The ladrones had escaped and we set\nout in pursuit of them on a chase wilder than a Quixotic dream. We\nwound our way into the mountains behind the town, inquiring at every\ngrass hut we passed whether the band of ladrones had passed that way,\nbut only once was even a trace of them found. Then it was learned that\nat a certain place they had separated into groups of three or four and\ngone glimmering through the dream of things that were. This place was\nin a secluded nook of the mountains where in years gone by some\nadventurous Spaniard had erected a primitive water mill to grind his\nsugar-cane. We had now marched about twenty miles and the feet of the\npedagogues were a mass of blisters. They had reached the point where\nthat form of military maneuvering called \"hiking\" ceased to possess\nany alluring charms. So a native was persuaded to come out of his lone\nmountain hut and hitch up his carabao and cart. He was then made to\nget on the carabao's back, while the aforesaid pedagogues lay down on\nthe sugar-cane pulp that had been put into the body of the cart, and\nthe driver was instructed to start for the post we had left hours\nbefore, and not to stop until he got there. Being uncertain but that\nsome of the ladrones would learn of our having left the body of troops\nand would try the metal of our steel, we at first agreed that neither\nof us should go to sleep, but it was later decided that probably the\ndriver had no greater desire to cross the Styx than his passengers had\nand that in case of danger he would awaken us, so both took a revolver\nin each hand, stretched out supinely and went to sleep.\n\nSuch a sleep! The rough jolting of the cart over an almost impassable\nroad was never enough to break the spell of slumber. When we awoke the\nblazing tropic sun was past the midday mark of morning, shining full\ninto our unprotected and well-nigh blistered faces.\n\nA pack of dogs were heralding our approach to a little village at the\nfoot of the mountains where ponies were procured to take us back to\nthe post."

                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently\nno time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth dimension of Space\nas a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house\nbecame quite quiet.\n\nOn reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up\nagainst a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realize\nhis position. Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\nhundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the\nDowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone\ninto hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains on\none of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who\nhad been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr\nto nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair\nby the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six\nweeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become\nreconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that\nnotorious sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible\nnight when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his\ndressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and\nconfessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox\nout of \u00a350,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card, and swore that\nthe ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back\nto him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because\nhe had seen a green hand tapping at the window-pane, to the beautiful\nLady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round\nher throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin,\nand who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of the\nKing's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he went\nover his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as\nhe recalled to mind his last appearance as \"Red Reuben, or the Strangled\nBabe,\" his d\u00e9but as \"Guant Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,\"\n\nand the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely\nplaying ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And\nafter all this some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him\nthe Rising Sun Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite\nunbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever been treated in this\nmanner. Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance, and remained till\ndaylight in an attitude of deep thought.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III\n\n\nThe next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed\nthe ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. \"I have\nno wish,\" he said, \"to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say\nthat, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,\"--a very just remark,\nat which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.\n\n\"Upon the other hand,\" he continued, \"if he really declines to use the\nRising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him. It\nwould be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside\nthe bedrooms.\"\n\nFor the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the\nblood-stain on the library floor. This certainly was very strange, as\nthe door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept\nclosely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a\ngood deal of comment. Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red,\nthen it would be vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came\ndown for family prayers, according to the simple rites of the Free\nAmerican Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright\nemerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party\nvery much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening. The\nonly person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia, who,\nfor some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the\nsight of the blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was\nemerald-green.\n\nThe second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in\nthe hall. Rushing down-stairs, they found that a large suit of old\narmour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone\nfloor, while seated in a high-backed chair was the Canterville ghost,\nrubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face. The\ntwins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged\ntwo pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained\nby long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United\nStates Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in\naccordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost\nstarted up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a\nmist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so\nleaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase\nhe recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of\ndemoniac laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely\nuseful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single\nnight, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French\ngovernesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly\nlaughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and\nrang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door\nopened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown. \"I am\nafraid you are far from well,\" she said, \"and have brought you a bottle\nof Doctor Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a\nmost excellent remedy.\" The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at\nonce to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an\naccomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family\ndoctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's\nuncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps,\nhowever, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself\nwith becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep\nchurchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.\n\nOn reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the\nmost violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross\nmaterialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what\nreally distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit\nof mail. He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by\nthe sight of a Spectre in armour, if for no more sensible reason, at\nleast out of respect for their natural poet Longfellow, over whose\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\nhour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides it was his own suit.\n\nHe had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament, and had\nbeen highly complimented on it by no less a person than the Virgin Queen\nherself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely overpowered\nby the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen\nheavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees severely, and\nbruising the knuckles of his right hand.\n\nFor some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of\nhis room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.\n\nHowever, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to\nmake a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his\nfamily. He selected Friday, August 17th, for his appearance, and spent\nmost of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in\nfavour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet\nfrilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards evening a\nviolent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was\njust such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to\nmake his way quietly to Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the\nfoot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\nof low music. He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville\nblood-stain by means of Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent. Having reduced\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and\nhis wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead,\nwhile he hissed into her trembling husband's ear the awful secrets of\nthe charnel-house. With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made\nup his mind. She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and\ngentle. A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more\nthan sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the\ncounterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins, he was quite\ndetermined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be done was, of\ncourse, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling\nsensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each\nother, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse,\ntill they became paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw off the\nwinding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white, bleached bones and\none rolling eyeball, in the character of \"Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's\nSkeleton,\" a r\u00f4le in which he had on more than one occasion produced a\ngreat effect, and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of\n\"Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.\"\n\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the\nlight-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves\nbefore they retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still,\nand, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the\nwindow-panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family\nslept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\ncould hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States. He\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his\nmurdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like\nan evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.\n\nOnce he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only\nthe baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange\nsixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\nin the midnight air. Finally he reached the corner of the passage that\nled to luckless Washington's room. For a moment he paused there, the\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's\nshroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was\ncome. He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had\nhe done so than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid\nhis blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was\nstanding a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous\nas a madman's dream! Its head was bald and burnished; its face round,\nand fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\nfeatures into an eternal grin. From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\nlight, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like\nto his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form. On its breast\nwas a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of\nshame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime,\nand, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\n\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's\njack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler. Once in the\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small\npallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes. After a time, however,\nthe brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to\ngo and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight. Accordingly,\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling\nthat, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid\nof his new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins. On reaching\nthe spot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had\nevidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from\nits hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it\nwas leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable\nattitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his\nhorror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a\nrecumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity\nbed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow\nturnip lying at his feet! Unable to understand this curious\ntransformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there,\nin the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:--\n        +------------------------------------+\n        |         YE OTIS GHOSTE             |\n        | Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook, |\n        |    Beware of Ye Imitationes.       |\n        |   All others are counterfeite.     |\n        +------------------------------------+\nThe whole thing flashed across him. He had been tricked, foiled, and\nout-witted! The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his\ntoothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his\nhead, swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\nschool, that, when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds\nof blood would be wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.\n\nHardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of\na distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh,\nand waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\nreason, did not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back\nto his room, thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose. There he\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was\nexceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which this oath\nhad been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second time. \"Perdition\nseize the naughty fowl,\" he muttered, \"I have seen the day when, with my\nstout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow\nfor me an 'twere in death!\" He then retired to a comfortable lead\ncoffin, and stayed there till evening.\n\n\nCHAPTER: IV\n\n\nThe next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were\ncompletely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five\ndays he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point\nof the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want\nit, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a\nlow, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating\nthe symbolic value of sensuous phenomena. The question of phantasmic\napparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a\ndifferent matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large\noriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every month, and he\ndid not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is\nquite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand,\nhe was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.\n\nFor the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as\nusual between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible\nprecaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots,\ntrod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large\nblack velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for\noiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good\ndeal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of\nprotection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he\nslipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a\nlittle humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see\nthat there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a\ncertain degree, it served his purpose. Still in spite of everything he\nwas not left unmolested. Strings were continually being stretched across\nthe corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion,\nwhile dressed for the part of \"Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley\nWoods,\" he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide,\nwhich the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry\nChamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged\nhim, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and\nsocial position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the\nnext night in his celebrated character of \"Reckless Rupert, or the\nHeadless Earl.\"\n\nHe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in\nfact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means\nof it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord\nCanterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome\nJack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\ndown the terrace at twilight. Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\nLord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken\nheart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it\nhad been a great success. It was, however an extremely difficult\n\"make-up,\" if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more\nscientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three\nhours to make his preparations. At last everything was ready, and he was\nvery pleased with his appearance. The big leather riding-boots that went\nwith the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\nfind one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite\nsatisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting\nand crept down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins,\nwhich I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of\nthe colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make\nan effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water\nfell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his\nleft shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed. The shock to his\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\ncould go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold. The only\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\nhad not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences\nmight have been very serious.\n\nHe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,\nand contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in\nlist slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\ndraughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the\ntwins. The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September. He\nhad gone down-stairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that\nthere, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing\nhimself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of\nthe United States Minister and his wife which had now taken the place of\nthe Canterville family pictures. He was simply but neatly clad in a long\nshroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip\nof yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In\nfact, he was dressed for the character of \"Jonas the Graveless, or the\nCorpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,\" one of his most remarkable\nimpersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to\nremember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their\nneighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a quarter-past two o'clock in\nthe morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring. As\nhe was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any\ntraces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a\ndark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads,\nand shrieked out \"BOO!\" in his ear.\n\nSeized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural,\nhe rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him\nthere with the big garden-syringe, and being thus hemmed in by his\nenemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the\ngreat iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to\nmake his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own\nroom in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.\n\nAfter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins\nlay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\nservants, but it was of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings\nwere so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed\nhis great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had\nbeen engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized a wonderful\nclam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse\neuchre, poker, and other American national games, and Virginia rode\nabout the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire,\nwho had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville\nChase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in\nfact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who,\nin reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best\ncongratulations to the Minister's worthy wife.\n\nThe Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the\nhouse, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let\nmatters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the\nyoung Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had\nonce bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice\nwith the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the\nfloor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state that, though\nhe lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but\n\"Double Sixes.\" The story was well known at the time, though, of course,\nout of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt\nwas made to hush it up, and a full account of all the circumstances\nconnected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle's\nRecollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends. The ghost, then,\nwas naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence\nover the Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his\nown first cousin having been married en secondes noces to the Sieur de\nBulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are\nlineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to\nVirginia's little lover in his celebrated impersonation of \"The Vampire\nMonk, or the Bloodless Benedictine,\" a performance so horrible that when\nold Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in\nthe year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which\nculminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after\ndisinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and\nleaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment,\nhowever, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the\nlittle Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal\nBedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.\n\n\nCHAPTER: V\n\n\nA few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out\nriding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting\nthrough a hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go\nup by the back staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past\nthe Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied\nshe saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother's maid, who\nsometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend\nher habit. To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville\nGhost himself! He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of\nthe yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing\nmadly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his hand, and his\nwhole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so forlorn, and so\nmuch out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea\nhad been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity,\nand determined to try and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so\ndeep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she\nspoke to him.\n\n\"I am so sorry for you,\" she said, \"but my brothers are going back to\nEton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy\nyou.\"\n\n\"It is absurd asking me to behave myself,\" he answered, looking round in\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,\n\"quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and\nwalk about at night, if that is what you mean. It is my only reason for\nexisting.\"\n\n\"It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very\nwicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had\nkilled your wife.\"\n\n\"Well, I quite admit it,\" said the Ghost, petulantly, \"but it was a\npurely family matter, and concerned no one else.\"\n\n\"It is very wrong to kill any one,\" said Virginia, who at times had a\nsweet puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.\n\n\"Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very\nplain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about\ncookery. Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent\npricket, and do you know how she had it sent to table? However, it is\nno matter now, for it is all over, and I don't think it was very nice of\nher brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.\"\n\n\"Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost--I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry? I\nhave a sandwich in my case. Would you like it?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you,\nall the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\nvulgar, dishonest family.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Virginia, stamping her foot, \"it is you who are rude, and\nhorrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the\npaints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain\nin the library. First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and\nI couldn't do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the\nchrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese\nwhite, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing\nto look at, and not at all easy to paint. I never told on you, though I\nwas very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for\nwho ever heard of emerald-green blood?\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" said the Ghost, rather meekly, \"what was I to do? It is\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother\nbegan it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I\nshould not have your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of\ntaste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest\nin England; but I know you Americans don't care for things of this\nkind.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\nand improve your mind. My father will be only too happy to give you a\nfree passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind,\nthere will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are\nall Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\nhave a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family ghost.\"\n\n\"I don't think I should like America.\"\n\n\"I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,\" said Virginia,\nsatirically.\n\n\"No ruins! no curiosities!\" answered the Ghost; \"you have your navy and\nyour manners.\"\n\n\"Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week's\nholiday.\"\n\n\"Please don't go, Miss Virginia,\" he cried; \"I am so lonely and so\nunhappy, and I really don't know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I\ncannot.\"\n\n\"That's quite absurd! You have merely to go to bed and blow out the\ncandle. It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\nchurch, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why, even\nbabies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.\"\n\n\"I have not slept for three hundred years,\" he said sadly, and\nVirginia's beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; \"for three hundred\nyears I have not slept, and I am so tired.\"\n\nVirginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like\nrose-leaves. She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked\nup into his old withered face.\n\n\"Poor, poor Ghost,\" she murmured; \"have you no place where you can\nsleep?\"\n\n\"Far away beyond the pine-woods,\" he answered, in a low, dreamy voice,\n\"there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\nsings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold crystal\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\nsleepers.\"\n\nVirginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\n\n\"You mean the Garden of Death,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth,\nwith the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have\nno yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at\npeace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of death's\nhouse, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death\nis.\"\n\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\nthere was silence. She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\n\nThen the ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of\nthe wind.\n\n\"Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?\"\n\n\"Oh, often,\" cried the little girl, looking up; \"I know it quite well.\n\nIt is painted in curious black letters, and is difficult to read. There\nare only six lines:\n    \"'When a golden girl can win\n    Prayer from out the lips of sin,\n    When the barren almond bears,\n    And a little child gives away its tears,\n    Then shall all the house be still\n    And peace come to Canterville.'\n\n\"But I don't know what they mean.\"\n\n\"They mean,\" he said, sadly, \"that you must weep with me for my sins,\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle,\nthe angel of death will have mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\ncannot prevail.\"\n\nVirginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair\nas he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes. \"I am not afraid,\" she said\nfirmly, \"and I will ask the angel to have mercy on you.\"\n\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as\nhe led her across the dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were\nbroidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back. \"Go back! little Virginia,\"\n\nthey cried, \"go back!\" but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly,\nand she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails\nand goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and\nmurmured, \"Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,\"\n\nbut the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When\nthey reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she\ncould not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly\nfading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A\nbitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her\ndress. \"Quick, quick,\" cried the Ghost, \"or it will be too late,\" and\nin a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry\nChamber was empty.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VI\n\n\nAbout ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not\ncome down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia\nanywhere. As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\nevening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all\nalarmed at first, but when six o'clock struck, and Virginia did not\nappear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for\nher, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house. At\nhalf-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\nof their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of\nexcitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly\nremembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies\npermission to camp in the park. He accordingly at once set off for\nBlackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son\nand two of the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire, who was\nperfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too,\nbut Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a\nscuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gipsies had\ngone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as\nthe fire was still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.\n\nHaving sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran\nhome, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the\ncounty, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been\nkidnapped by tramps or gipsies. He then ordered his horse to be brought\nround, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down\nto dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with a groom. He had hardly,\nhowever, gone a couple of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after\nhim, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with\nhis face very flushed, and no hat. \"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,\" gasped\nout the boy, \"but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.\n\nPlease don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year,\nthere would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me back,\nwill you? I can't go! I won't go!\"\n\nThe Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace,\nand was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down\nfrom his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, \"Well,\nCecil, if you won't go back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must\nget you a hat at Ascot.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!\" cried the little Duke, laughing,\nand they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of\nthe station-master if any one answering to the description of Virginia\nhad been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her. The\nstation-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him\nthat a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a\nhat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his\nshutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away,\nwhich he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as there was a\nlarge common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman, but\ncould get no information from him, and, after riding all over the\ncommon, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase\nabout eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found\nWashington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with\nlanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest trace of\nVirginia had been discovered. The gipsies had been caught on Brockley\nmeadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they should be late. Indeed, they had\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's disappearance, as they\nwere very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his\npark, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search.\n\nThe carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone\nover, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any\nrate, Virginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest\ndepression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they\nfound a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\nwas poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and\nhaving her forehead bathed with eau de cologne by the old housekeeper.\n\nMr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up\nsupper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one\nspoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very\nfond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the\nentreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that\nnothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in\nthe morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down\nimmediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight\nbegan to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded\nthey heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder\nshook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a\npanel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out\non the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her\nhand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs.\nOtis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with\nviolent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.\n\n\"Good heavens! child, where have you been?\" said Mr. Otis, rather\nangrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them.\n\n\"Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and\nyour mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these\npractical jokes any more.\"\n\n\"Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!\" shrieked the twins, as they\ncapered about.\n\n\"My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side\nagain,\" murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair.\n\n\"Papa,\" said Virginia, quietly, \"I have been with the Ghost. He is dead,\nand you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was\nreally sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of\nbeautiful jewels before he died.\"\n\nThe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave\nand serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a\nlighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they\ncame to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia\ntouched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves\nin a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated\nwindow. Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was\na gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone\nfloor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers\nan old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its\nreach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was\ncovered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but\na pile of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding\nher little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the\nparty looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\ndisclosed to them.\n\n\"Hallo!\" suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out\nof the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\nsituated. \"Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.\"\n\n\"God has forgiven him,\" said Virginia, gravely, as she rose to her feet,\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.\n\n\"What an angel you are!\" cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round\nher neck, and kissed her.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VII\n\n\nFour days after these curious incidents, a funeral started from\nCanterville Chase at about eleven o'clock at night. The hearse was drawn\nby eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\nnodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\npurple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville\ncoat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\nservants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully\nimpressive. Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up\nspecially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first\ncarriage along with little Virginia. Then came the United States\nMinister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the\nlast carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had\nbeen frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she\nhad a right to see the last of him. A deep grave had been dug in the\ncorner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service\nwas read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, the servants, according to an old custom\nobserved in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as\nthe coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward,\nand laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms. As\nshe did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its\nsilent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a\nnightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of the\nGarden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a\nword during the drive home.\n\nThe next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given\nto Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby\nnecklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen\nof sixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis\nfelt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"I know that in this country mortmain is held to\napply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that\nthese jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg\nyou, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you\nunder certain strange conditions. As for my daughter, she is merely a\nchild, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such\nappurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I\nmay say, is no mean authority upon Art,--having had the privilege of\nspending several winters in Boston when she was a girl,--that these gems\nare of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\nprice. Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you\nwill recognize how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\nin the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such\nvain gauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\nBritish aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who\nhave been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles\nof Republican simplicity. Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box, as a memento of\nyour unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is extremely old, and\nconsequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to\ncomply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good deal\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with medi\u00e6valism\nin any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was\nborn in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned\nfrom a trip to Athens.\"\n\nLord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister's speech,\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile,\nand when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\nsaid: \"My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky\nancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are\nmuch indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck. The jewels\nare clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough\nto take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave\nin a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. As for their being\nheirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or\nlegal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite\nunknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and\nwhen Miss Virginia grows up, I dare say she will be pleased to have\npretty things to wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the\nfurniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to\nthe ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity\nSir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he\nwas really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase.\"\n\nMr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville's refusal, and\nbegged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was\nquite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to\nretain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of\n1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's first\ndrawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the\nuniversal theme of admiration. For Virginia received the coronet, which\nis the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her\nboy-lover as soon as he came of age. They were both so charming, and\nthey loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the\nmatch, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch\nthe Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less\nthan three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to\nsay, Mr. Otis himself. Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke\npersonally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his\nown words, \"was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating\ninfluences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of\nRepublican simplicity should be forgotten.\" His objections, however,\nwere completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the\naisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his\narm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of\nEngland.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to\nCanterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over\nin the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods. There had\nbeen a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir\nSimon's tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it\nsimply the initials of the old gentleman's name, and the verse from the\nlibrary window. The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses,\nwhich she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for\nsome time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There\nthe Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her\nfeet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly\nhe threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her,\n\"Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.\"\n\n\"Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have,\" he answered, smiling, \"you have never told me what\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.\"\n\n\"I have never told any one, Cecil,\" said Virginia, gravely.\n\n\"I know that, but you might tell me.\"\n\n\"Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you. Poor Sir Simon! I owe\nhim a great deal. Yes, don't laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see\nwhat Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than\nboth.\"\n\nThe Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.\n\n\"You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,\" he murmured.\n\n\"You have always had that, Cecil.\"\n\n\"And you will tell our children some day, won't you?\"\n\nVirginia blushed.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.\n\nYet Millet would have us understand that in spite of this, the\nshepherd is performing a duty to humanity not to be underrated. The\nsheep he has so carefully and conscientiously reared will form food\nto-morrow for many a hungry town-dweller. Further, he would have us\nfollow the peasant as he closes the pen for the night and traces his\ntired steps towards his simple home in the village. The frugal and\nhard-earned meal, prepared for him by his wife, who like himself has\nhad her share of duties to occupy her during the day, is partaken of\nsurrounded by a hungry and joyous group of children. Such themes\nsuggested by the simplicity of his own life appealed to him with\nirresistible force, and it is in their portrayal that his greatness is\nmanifested.\n\nPerhaps no season of the year presented the same attraction for Millet\nas the spring. The period when all the earth after its long winter\nsleep is about to waken into new life seems to have always been a\nsource of inspiration to him. In \"The Sower\" he emphasises the fact\nthat the fruits of the harvest are not to be had without due labour\nbeing expended upon the earth. The sloping field, barren of\nvegetation, and crowned at the top with a small clump of trees, is\nbeing broken up by the distant plough drawn by two horses and guided\nby a peasant. The latter figure is one of the noblest of Millet's\ncreations. By his strained and ever-attentive attitude, by his\ncontinuous tramp over the rough and broken ground, he shows us the\nmonotony of his toil. He crosses the field in one direction, only to\nreturn at an interval of a few feet. In the foreground we have the\nsower, a middle-aged man of typical peasant type, on whose left side a\nbag of seeds is slung. With automatic precision he withdraws a\nhandful, and strews it into the furrows open to receive it. So long as\nhe continues in the same track his labour will be well performed, and\nhence his task is just as monotonous as that of his fellow-worker\nhigher up in the field. The silhouetting of these two figures against\nthe light is symbolical of the labour to be expended in life before\nresults are forthcoming.\n\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that in considering the works of\nMillet, one must not judge him from the standpoint of a mere painter.\n\nHis brush is only the means to an end, and by its means he is enabled\nto bring the fruits of his philosophic observation before us in\npermanent form. It has been charged against the \"Angelus\" that it was\nnot a remarkably fine piece of painting, that many a young artist of\nthe present generation is infinitely better equipped, technically\nspeaking, than the master who wrought this celebrated canvas. This may\nin a measure be true, but it must never be forgotten that Millet\nbrought into play exactly the means which could illustrate his meaning\nin the clearest terms. He had not intended, in painting such a\npicture, to produce a work which would astonish his fellow artists\nwith its brilliancy of handling or magnificence of colour. He wanted\nto make the beholder forget the painter and absorb the lesson. This\nquality runs right through the art of Millet, and it is from this\nstandpoint that we are obliged to weigh his merits.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE\n\n\nJean Fran\u00e7ois Millet was born on October 4, 1814, that is at the\nperiod when French art, at any rate as far as landscape painting is\nconcerned, had reached its lowest ebb. Throughout the eighteenth\ncentury the landscape painter had been hard put to make a living. The\ntaste of connoisseurs throughout the century had been for portraits\nand interiors, or for those numerous pastoral subjects which were\ncarried out with so much decorative charm by such men as Watteau and\nBoucher. Such landscape painting as existed was of the type\npopularised by Vernet; it was built upon a curious mixture of Italian\ninfluence coming from Panini and Salvator Rosa. The only evidence of\nrevolt against such a state of affairs we find in the works of Hubert\nRobert and Moreau. These two, and more especially would I direct the\nreader's attention to the latter, struggled hard to break down the\nconventionalities of the time. They endeavoured to infuse some sense\nof atmosphere into their pictures, and whilst frequently their trees\nand figures are painfully formal, they yet stand alone in the French\nschool as the pioneers of a phase of art which was to attain its\nzenith in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBut after the Revolution, and during the whole of the time that France\nwas under the domination of Napoleon, very rigid principles indeed\nwere enforced with regard to the direction that art should take. The\ninnovation which had its commencement in the reign of Louis XVI. swept\neverything before it as it gained force. Classical art and traditions\ndominated the whole French school, and no artist, however great his\nreputation, attempted for many years to swim against the stream. In\nspite of the principles of liberty and equality which were claimed for\nall under the new r\u00e9gime, a terribly strict eye was kept upon any\ninnovations which might break out in the form of a naturalistic art.\n\nThe directors of this new movement failed to see that the conditions\nwhich had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed\naway, and that the latter's supremacy was due to the fact that their\nproductions were symbolical of the loftiest thoughts of their own\nepoch. The art which expresses the ambitions and noblest thoughts of\nits time will alone endure. These expressions are not applicable to\nany other condition than those which called them forth, and hence in\nattempting to purify the rococo which had existed up to the middle of\nthe eighteenth century, by a return to classical traditions, they were\nonly copying that which their predecessors had done, and in so doing\nleft us without any original expression of their own time.\n\nInto such a condition of affairs was Millet born, and he was numbered\namongst that little band of men which included Rousseau, Corot, Dupr\u00e9,\nDiaz, and Daumier, who were to lay the foundations of the modern\nnaturalistic school. At the outset it was seemingly a hopeless\nstruggle they undertook; a struggle against prejudice and influence\nwhich was only to be brought to a victorious culmination after years\nof struggle and disappointment. Of this little band, Millet was\nperhaps the best equipped for the privations which were necessary. He\ncame of a peasant stock who inhabited Gruchy, a small village\nsituated in the commune of Gr\u00e9ville, close to Cherbourg. Grouped\nunderneath the humble roof was the grandmother, who had been left a\nwidow fifteen years before; her son, Jean Louis Nicolas Millet, and\nhis wife and eight children, of which our artist was the second. His\ngrandmother appears to have been a pious old lady, whose chief delight\nwas in her grandchildren, to whom she taught those religious\nprinciples which stood them in good stead in after life. We are told\nthat Millet's father possessed a force of character one does not often\nfind amongst men in his rank of life. He was of a contemplative\ndisposition, and had a keenly developed feeling for natural beauty. He\npossessed moreover a keen appreciation of music, which unfortunately\nhe does not appear to have had much opportunity of cultivating. His\nwife was an excellent housewife and of a religious turn of mind. The\nhouse they occupied, situated quite a short distance from the sea, was\nplaced in a tract of country which, whilst it had rugged and\npicturesque features, was not of a nature which would yield\nextraordinary results under cultivation. It was, therefore, a hard\nstruggle for existence which Millet in his first years saw going\non around him. Not that the family were any the less happy for having\nto work laboriously for their livelihood. They had been brought up\namidst such surroundings; their wants were simple and easily\ngratified, and the tranquillity of the m\u00e9nage more than\ncounterbalanced those doubtful luxuries which easier circumstances\nwould have brought their way. Throughout his life Millet maintained\nthe extreme simplicity he had seen practised in the home of his\nchildhood, and long years afterwards he was accustomed to look back\nwith pleasureable memories upon his early years.\n\nGruchy, situated in one of the wildest parts of Normandy, feels the\nfull effect of every storm which blows up from the Atlantic. There is\nnothing to shelter the exposed hamlets studded along the coast from\nthe fury of the western gale, and the rocks are but too often strewn\nwith the wrecks of vessels which have come to grief in that terrible\nsea. Millet in his youth must have witnessed many of these\ncatastrophes. Quite a number of drawings by him are extant\nrepresenting succour being extended to some vessel in difficulties, or\nthe hauling up of some wreckage on to the rocks. The studious boy\nmust have been impressed as he saw the sternness of the combat in his\nnative country between men and nature; the wind-swept fields, and\nhills bare to the point of savageness. The very trees themselves\ndwarfed and gnarled; in their struggle with the elements they have\nbeen made tough and hardy as the inhabitants of the country\nthemselves, and, stunted as they are, yet show well that they can\nresist the force of the fiercest storm. The brooding and contemplative\ncharacter of the father having descended to the son, we can quite\nimagine the effect such surroundings would have upon him. As he looked\nback in after years upon his roamings in his native country, he\nappreciated the awe-inspiring character of the scenery in which he had\nbeen born. He would doubtless recall many a walk amidst the fields\nwith the wind blowing in his face as it rushed in from the Atlantic,\nthe rain beating hard upon the freshly ploughed fields, and the\ndistant figure of the ploughman struggling hard with his team against\nthe stiff sou'wester. The great mass of vapour overhead whirled before\nthe violence of the storm, casting grey and pearly light over the\nwhole scene, whilst far away on the top of the hill a clump of trees,\nbent with their resistance to the wind, are silhouetted against the\nsky. Many a drawing of this kind we encounter in the later work of\nMillet, which shows how his thoughts harked back in certain moments to\nthe scenes he had left behind him for ever.\n\nWe know that on one or two occasions he returned to Gruchy. Once or\ntwice he had urgent business which took him back, but sometimes he\nwent with no other purpose than to renew acquaintance with the scenes\nof yore.\n\nLittle Jean Fran\u00e7ois was his grandmother's favourite. It was she who\ntaught him the names of things which surrounded him, and perhaps\ndirected his thoughts in the channels to which they were finally to be\ndevoted. Her brother Charles, who formed one of the family, used to\ntake him for walks, telling him stories on the way. Millet was\ndevotedly attached to this old man, and when at the age of seven years\nhe lost him, the gap in his life thus left made an impression upon his\nmemory never to be effaced.\n\nFive years afterwards he was placed in the hands of the vicar for the\npurpose of preparing him for his first communion. The good man seems\nto have been taken with the child; he found him so attentive to all\nnatural phenomenon which was passing around him and intelligent in an\nunusual degree. He quickly learnt a considerable amount of Latin,\nwhich introduced him to the great classics. Unfortunately for Millet,\nthe vicar accepted an offer of transference to a better parish in the\nvicinity. The boy had made such progress with his master that it was\ndecided that he should go with him to his new abode. He was, however,\nso missed in his own home, that when he came back for his first\nholidays it was decided that he should not return.\n\nHe now gave serious attention to the agricultural pursuits of his\nfather. He threw himself heartily into the work of the farm, and\nassisted in the work of sowing and harvesting, of pruning and\nthrashing according to the season. His spare time was occupied in\nreading with avidity various masterpieces of literature. The authors\nhe found at hand were such as F\u00e9n\u00e9lon and Bossuet, but he developed a\ndecided preference, which lasted till the end of his life, for Virgil\nand the Bible.\n\nIt was at this time that his taste for art began to be developed.\n\nHe drew the objects he found around him, and soon acquired sufficient\nconfidence in his skill to execute a large drawing representing two\nshepherds keeping guard over their sheep. These first efforts date\nfrom about his seventeenth year, and foretell the advent of the style\nin which he was later to become pre-eminent.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE MIGRATION TO PARIS\n\n\nHow frequently has it happened that the first years in the life of a\ngenius have been employed in labour quite different from that to which\nthey should have been directed. Such a state of affairs the more often\noccurs when the sense of duty has been strong enough to overcome\ntemporarily the inclination to pursue the natural bent. In the case of\nMillet, however, the early years which he devoted to the farm and its\npursuits were by no means wasted. It is on record that he became very\nproficient in the various duties in which he was engaged, but at the\nsame time we can be quite sure that his extraordinary faculties of\nobservation were constantly being brought into play, and the fruits of\nhis observations are to be seen in the pictures of his mature period.\n\nA considerable portion of his spare time was taken up with drawing,\nnot only the persons and objects he found around him, but also\nsubjects suggested to him by the books he was in the habit of reading.\n\nHis family, so far from throwing any obstacles in his way, encouraged\nhim. In fact it was his father who took him first to Cherbourg in\norder to show a painter of that town, named Mouchel, the early\nproducts of his son's genius. The decision at which Millet p\u00e8re had\narrived was prompted by a drawing in charcoal of an old peasant\nwalking along the road, which had struck him forcibly as being a work\nof extraordinary merit. It says much for Mouchel's breadth of mind\nthat he was equally impressed with the drawings. A man who had been\nbrought up in the school of David, and who had lived in one of the\nmost reactionary periods of French art, was hardly to be expected to\ntake kindly to a style so diametrically opposed to all the traditions\ninto which he himself had been inculcated; certainly the young\nMillet, who had now arrived at the age of eighteen, had not developed\nthe extraordinary freedom which his works of ten years later\ndemonstrate. But there was sufficient originality even in his early\ndrawings to call forth condemnation from a man who had been so\nsaturated with the teaching of David.\n\nHe prevailed upon Millet to leave his son with him, and set him to\nwork to copy many well-known works of art which he brought before his\npupil by means of engravings. Two months were spent in this way when\nnews reached Millet that his father had been seized with sudden\nillness, and he was obliged in the circumstances to return to\nGr\u00e9ville. He arrived to find the old man unconscious, and very shortly\nafterwards he died.\n\nThis misfortune awoke in Millet a sense of duty which compelled him to\ndesert his studies in Cherbourg and superintend the management of the\nfarm. For some time he devoted himself entirely to his new duties, but\nthe struggle betwixt duty and genius continued; he gave himself to his\nwork with all the energy at his disposal, but his thoughts were ever\nwandering to his art.\n\nAdded to his own inclinations, his grandmother, who perceived his\nextraordinary gifts, strongly persuaded him to devote his attention\nentirely to art, and consequently after some little time he decided to\nreturn to Cherbourg. Here he entered the studio of M. Langlois, an\nartist whose reputation in the town was considerable. Again in this\nworthy man he came in contact with a painter who had been brought up\nentirely under classical influence. Langlois, who had in his early\ndays been a pupil of Gros, had absorbed the classical tradition to\nsuch an extent as to be incapable of appreciating any other style. He\nappears to have endeavoured to mould Millet in his own method rather\nthan develop the latent genius which the latter possessed. The\nincompatibility of these two men speedily caused the younger to strike\nout in his own way. He saw more good in frequenting the museums and\nmaking copies of such works as appealed to him than in listening to\nthe advice of his teacher. All this occurred, however, without any\nbreach of friendship occurring. On the contrary, Langlois, after\nperceiving the futility of inducing his pupil to follow in his\nfootsteps, did all he could to advance his interests.\n\nBy means of his influence some of Millet's drawings were brought\nbefore the Municipal Council, and Langlois suggested that Millet\nshould be sent to Paris in order to further his development, and that\nthe Council should set aside a modest pension to meet his requirements\nin that city. The discussion appears to have been very prolonged, and\nupon the question being put to a vote it was only carried by means of\nthe casting vote of the mayor. Four hundred francs was at first\nallotted to him in this way, which was further increased shortly\nafterwards to six hundred. Such encouragement, meagre though it was,\nwas sufficient to give him a foothold in the metropolis. He left\nCherbourg in January 1837, on a cold and raw day, the snow falling\nheavily throughout the entire journey, and arrived in Paris in a very\ndisheartened condition. The miserable weather, coupled with the long\njourney in which he had had time to think of the small sum which lay\nbetween him and starvation, going to a city which he had never seen\nbefore, had all served to work upon his nerves, and he entered the\ngreat city sick at heart and very despondent.\n\nOne of the first visits he made after he was somewhat settled down in\nParis was to the Louvre. Here he was brought into contact for the\nfirst time with many masters, who were to mould his yet plastic\ntemperament into the form which enabled him to give to the world, in\nlater years, so many masterpieces. As I have said before, it was\nMantegna who first captivated him, and the influence of the mighty\nPaduan was never finally to be shaken off. Michel Angelo awed him with\nhis sublimity; his classical severity tempered with intense humanism,\nhis masculine strength, were bound to have their effect upon so\nserious a character as Millet. Strange as it may seem to those who are\nbut superficially acquainted with his art, and are only too apt to\njudge him by the influence he has had upon modern French painting, he\nwas fascinated with the antique. The traditions of Phidias and\nPraxiteles, in the form in which they had been transmitted through the\ngreatest minds of the Renaissance, were ever the factors which guided\nhim throughout his career. It was this same spirit which impelled his\nfervid admiration for Nicolas Poussin, a master who to-day is sadly\nunderrated and but little understood. It was the mysteries of line,\nthe wonders of pose and composition rather than the magic of colour\nwhich appealed to him. He had a profound admiration for the glowing\ncanvases of Titian and Rubens, but he could never overlook entirely\ntheir defects of drawing or, in the case of Rubens, the tendency to\nvulgarity. From his remarks in after years it would appear that he was\nbaffled with the mysticisms of Velazquez and Rembrandt; pure painting\nitself could never hold him. He needed to grasp the message which lay\nbehind it before he felt fully taken into the confidence of the\npainter; and as the minds of the Dutchman and the Spaniard ran in\nquite different channels to his own, they spoke with a language he\nnever understood. That he had a perceptive and critically independent\nmind may be gauged from his enthusiasm for Delacroix, whose work he\nencountered for the first time at the Luxembourg.\n\nDuring this period of study he was carefully considering under what\nmaster he should place himself. His choice unhappily fell upon\nDelaroche. To any one acquainted with the work of the latter master,\na more unsuitable selection could not have been made. Delaroche and\nthe painters who surrounded him can be appropriately described as\nconstituting the back-wash of the Empire style, which had reached its\nclimax with David. His subjects were always treated with academic\nreserve. No pyrotechnics were permitted; on the contrary, an\neverlasting and mistaken striving for finish was encouraged:\noriginality was sternly suppressed. To paint human life as it really\nwas, was too vulgar for any of the painters of this time. They held\nthe public taste enslaved for years. An innovator such as Millet was\ndestined to become found his position almost untenable. The band of\ncritics and painters formed a monopoly which it seemed almost\nimpossible to break down, and it was only after years of bitter and\ndetermined struggle that the school of nature finally routed its\nopponent.\n\nDelaroche doubtlessly found the peasant painter a little rude both in\nhis person and in his ideas about art. He paid but little attention to\nthe young man who had placed himself in his hands, and devoted all his\ntime to students who were more amenable to his influence. A\ntemperament so sensitive as Millet's was bound to notice this\nneglect, and consequently after a time he became so discouraged that\nhe ceased to frequent Delaroche's studio. Another very good reason for\nthis action was the lack of resources to continue his payments. Even\nduring the time he had been with Delaroche he lost no opportunity of\nturning a few honest francs by painting the portraits of any who could\nbe got to sit to him. Delaroche, however, had a more kindly heart than\nMillet imagined. He seems to have found out the real distress of the\nyoung artist, and to have assisted him pecuniarily in many ways, and\nthere is no doubt that he appreciated the talent of the young Norman\nmuch more than he cared to own. Many of his remarks on record would\nserve to show that Delaroche already felt that his pupil was destined\nto be one of the leaders of the movement which was finally to\noverthrow his own style, and doubtlessly felt a great admiration for a\nman who had the courage and strength to swim against rather than with\nthe current.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STRUGGLE FOR RECOGNITION\n\n\nFreed from all encumbrances save poverty, Millet was now to work out\nhis own destiny according to the dictates of his genius. He joined a\nfriend named Marolle, and the two together occupying a very small\napartment endeavoured to eke out an existence. It was only too soon\napparent that young as he was, and the taste of the public being not\nyet ready for development upon the lines his genius directed him, that\nhis livelihood could not be secured by endeavouring to sell such\nsubjects as appealed to him. In these straits he turned to\nportrait-painting, just as many great painters before and since him\nhave done. That the struggle was very keen can well be imagined by the\nfact that he was unable to obtain more than five to ten francs apiece;\nand, as commissions were very scarce, he was hard put to gain the\nmeans of subsistence. This state of affairs lasted until 1840, in\nwhich year he endeavoured to obtain admission to the Salon with two\nportraits, one of which was that of his friend. This, however, was\nrejected, and the other picture, although accepted, was unnoticed by\neither the critics or the public.\n\nHaving occasion the next year to pay a visit to Cherbourg, he felt\nobliged to report himself to the Municipal Council who had had the\ngenerosity to send him in the first place to Paris. Its worthy members\nexpressed themselves as but little satisfied with the result of their\ninvestment; they claimed that they had had as yet but little to show\nfor their money, and they suggested, partly as a means of\ndemonstrating that they had had some little return, and also, in order\nto see of what stuff their prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was made, that he should paint a\nportrait of the recently deceased mayor. As Millet had not been\npersonally acquainted with that worthy citizen, and as the only guide\nwhich could be supplied him was a portrait made in miniature when he\nwas a young man of some twenty-three or twenty-four years of age, the\ntask was by no means easy. However, the artist set to work with a\nwill, and finally accomplished the picture to his own satisfaction.\n\nUpon it being shown to the Council, one and all declared, as any one\nwith the slightest knowledge of such matters could have told them\nbefore it was commenced, that it bore not the least resemblance to the\ndefunct magistrate. They therefore demurred at the three hundred\nfrancs they had agreed to pay him for the portrait, and offered him\none-third of that amount instead. Millet was deeply offended by the\ninsult, and informed the Council that he made them a present of the\npicture.\n\nIt was during this short visit to his native country that he met his\nfirst wife, a Mlle. Ono, whose portrait he had painted. From the first\nshe was very delicate, and he lost her after much suffering, three\nyears later. His second wife was Mlle. Catherine Lemaire, who was\ndestined to be the companion of his struggles until the end of his\nlife.\n\nMeanwhile Millet was occupied with subjects which he thought would\nappeal to the general public. A number of classical pictures date from\nthis epoch. It was an endeavour on his part to fall in as far as\npossible with the current taste, and so supply means of subsistence\nfor his family. At the same time he did not neglect his favourite\nsubjects, and many are the wonderful studies of peasant life which\ndate from these years. His reputation had so far advanced that he was\noffered the position of teacher of drawing in the college at\nCherbourg. It must have been only after prolonged deliberation that he\nrefused the proffered post. Here a certain annual stipend was assured\nhim, and if it was not large in itself it would at any rate suffice to\nkeep the wolf from the door. He preferred, however, to return to Paris\nand work out his own destiny as best he might.\n\nMillet, who lived at this time in the Rue Rochechouart, began to\nsurround himself with that little group of friends who remained\nfaithful to him until the end of his career. Amongst the earliest were\nCharles Jacque and Diaz: the latter had several clients amongst the\nsmall dealers, whom he induced to visit Millet's studio and make now\nand again a small purchase.\n\nMillet now became a fairly regular contributor to the Salon, but\ngenerally sent some classical or religious picture as well as one of\nhis peasant subjects. For example, in 1848 he sent the marvellous\nstudy of \"The Winnower,\" which we all know so well, accompanied by a\ncanvas, \"The Captivity of the Jews at Babylon.\" The latter, however,\nwas so badly received that he utilised the canvas upon its return for\na large picture of a \"Shepherdess tending her Sheep.\"\n\nIn spite of the headway that he was making, the struggle for existence\nseemed keener than ever, and but for the kindness of friends he and\nhis family would frequently have actually wanted for food. A timely\nadvance of one hundred francs obtained for him from the Minister of\nFine Arts, together with a commission from the State, for which he was\npaid the sum of eighteen hundred francs, were for some time the only\nrelief he obtained from his embarrassments. That he was not particular\nas to how he earned his daily bread is apparent from the fact that he\ndid not despise an order for a shop sign for a midwife, for which he\nwas paid the miserable amount of thirty francs.\n\nThe year 1848 was not an encouraging one for a painter who was\nstanding on the threshold of his career. The whole of Europe was\nseething with revolution. A repetition of the fearful year of 1792 was\neverywhere expected. The struggle betwixt reaction and property on the\none hand, and lawlessness and revolution on the other, was being waged\nwith grim determination. The issue was for long in the balance. One\nnever knew from one day to another what was going to happen. In such a\ndeplorable state of affairs men's minds were running on politics and\nwars rather than upon art. Millet amongst the rest was called upon to\nshoulder the musket, and it can be easily imagined with what\nreluctance he did so.\n\nParis, the great centre of art, had yet not afforded him much\nencouragement. Life was dear in the big city, and surrounded on all\nsides by bricks and mortar he was not free to go out into the fields\nand study the objects which were uppermost in his mind. He resolved to\nescape from it, and once having put the plan into execution he never\nreturned.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET IN HIS MATURITY\n\n\nThe Barbizon of 1850 was a very different place from the Barbizon of\nto-day. The world fame of the men who passed a quiet and strenuous\nexistence in the little village has transformed it into a tourist\nresort, with restaurants and caf\u00e9s, the stopping-places for\nwaggonettes which in summer bring their daily load of sightseers,\neager to see the homes of the painters whose names are now household\nwords.\n\nIt would have been well-nigh impossible for the little band to have\nchosen a more suitable spot for their labours. Rousseau and Millet,\nmuch as they were drawn towards each other by the tie of a sympathetic\ndisposition and by their common interest in art, yet were widely\ndissimilar from one another in their outlook upon art and their\nmethods of worship at the common shrine. Rousseau--one can see it from\nevery picture he painted--loved with all the yearning of a passionate\nand restless temperament the inanimate in Nature. Observe with what\nfidelity he draws his trees, with what caressing tenderness his clouds\nand skies are treated; solitude appealed to him above all things, and\nif here and there he was obliged to insert a few figures to complete\nhis composition, one instinctively feels that he would rather have\nsubstituted a group of cattle or a flock of sheep. In the glades of\nthe forest, far from the busy haunts of men, with the glorious\nsunlight penetrating from above, the breeze moaning through the\nbranches, he was happy. A wild and turbulent temperament such as his\nnot infrequently discovers exquisite enjoyment amidst such perfect\ntranquillity.\n\nBarbizon, situated on the fringe of the great forest of Fontainebleau,\ntherefore, permitted Rousseau to come into daily contact with the\nscenes which so appealed to him.\n\nMillet, on the other hand, was absorbed in the peasant. The man who\ntilled the soil and raised the produce humanity requires for its\nsubsistence by the sweat of his brow; the manifold duties of the\nlabourer, his life and sorrows, appealed to him with irresistible\nforce. An unpeopled track of wild and uncultivated land would not call\nforth any emotion in him, no matter how sublime the scenery might be.\n\nThe life of the village, spreading itself into the vast and fertile\nplain behind, held him absorbed; a peasant himself and living amongst\nthe people he so loved, he was in a position to bring before an\nunthinking world the poignant monotony of their useful lives.\n\nUpon their first arrival at Barbizon, the two artists put up at a\nsmall inn, working all day in a tiny place they had rented from some\npeasants and fitted up as a studio. The inconveniences of this\narrangement were soon apparent, and shortly afterwards Millet took a\nsmall house which was destined to be his abode for the remainder of\nhis life; an old barn in the immediate vicinity meanwhile provided him\nwith an excellent studio.\n\nFrom this period onward we must date the greatest productions of the\nmaster, the works which have induced more thought than those of any\nother peasant painter. A peasant among peasants, his life was of the\nmost rigid simplicity. Behind his little abode a large garden\nstretched away almost to the fringe of the forest itself, and here he\nwas accustomed to work every morning, growing a portion of the food\nnecessary to the sustenance of his family. The afternoon he devoted to\npainting, whilst the evening was given over to intercourse with his\nlittle circle of friends. The simplicity and tranquillity of his life\naroused the whole of his powers to action, and surrounded with\neverything he valued in life he was supremely happy.\n\nThe country around Barbizon appealed to him irresistibly. The\ntimber-studded plains, the gently undulating, highly cultivated\nfields, presented a strange contrast to the wild and rugged country\namidst which he had spent his childhood, and no doubt conduced to the\ndevelopment of a more refined and contemplative style than he would\notherwise have acquired. Upon his few visits to his native country he\nappears to have been more impressed than ever with its austerity, and\nthe drawings which these journeys called forth bore ample evidence of\nthis feeling in him.\n\nLack of the necessary funds to carry on even his simple m\u00e9nage was\never the bane of Millet's life. On many occasions Sensier, his\nintimate friend and afterwards his biographer, informs us he dissuaded\nhim from suicide.\n\nThe sums that he owed, small though they were, rendered him in\nconstant fear of the brokers. With creditors so importunate in their\ndemands for satisfaction, and with the constant lack of recognition,\nwhich was his lot, it is astonishing that Millet achieved so much. He\nwas relieved more than once by the kind-hearted and ever faithful\nRousseau, who when his friend was sorest pressed found some delicately\nhidden means to relieve him. It was he who acquired for 4000 francs\nthe wonderful \"Peasant grafting a Tree,\" when the picture failed to\nfind a purchaser; and in order that Millet should not be aware of his\ngenerosity, he made the offer in the name of an imaginary American.\n\nThis sort of goodness he repeated more than once, and it redounds\nstill more to his credit when we remember that Rousseau himself was\nnot infrequently in pecuniary difficulties.\n\nA constant succession of important works made their appearance during\nthe first ten years Millet spent at Barbizon. The first was the\nwell-known \"Sower,\" which has ever been one of the most popular of his\npictures. Then came the far finer \"Peasants going to Work,\" which for\nmany years was in an English Collection. The \"Gleaners,\" perhaps the\nnoblest canvas the master ever painted, dates from 1857, in which year\nit was seen at the Salon; the celebrated \"Angelus\" followed it two\nyears later. The prices which Millet obtained for this series of\nremarkable works was fantastically small. The \"Gleaners\" brought him a\npaltry 2000 francs, whilst he accounted himself lucky to encounter an\namateur who gave him the same sum for the small \"Woman feeding Fowls.\"\n\nThe \"Angelus,\" which was never exhibited, was sold in the year it was\npainted to a Monsieur Feydeau, an architect, for 1800 francs. It then\npassed through several hands before the late Monsieur Secr\u00e9tan\ncompeted up to 160,000 francs before he became possessed of the prize\nat the John Wilson sale.\n\nThe purchase, however, proved a sound investment, for upon the\ndispersal of his collection it was knocked down for 553,000 francs to\na Monsieur Proust, acting on behalf of the French Government. The\nlatter, however, when they gave the commission to buy the picture, had\nno idea that such a high value would be placed upon it, and\nconsequently refused to ratify the sale; a syndicate now came upon the\nscene, who took it to America. The price, however, proved greater than\neven the millionaires of the States were prepared to give, and the\ncanvas again returned to France, where it found a resting-place in the\ncollection of Monsieur Chauchard, who paid the enormous sum of 800,000\nfrancs for its possession.\n\nIn 1859 Millet sent two works to the Salon, a \"Woman grazing her Cow,\"\nand \"Death and the Woodman.\" The latter, one of the most\nphilosophical of Millet's pictures, which to-day is the principal\nattraction of the Jacobsen Museum at Copenhagen, was rejected.\n\nDisappointments of this kind came with such systematic regularity to\nthe painter that he must have become proof against them. He always had\nbitter enemies amongst the critics, who never failed to pour abuse\nupon his method and his subjects. Even a number of his fellow artists\njoined in the chorus of disapproval. But the vehemence with which he\nwas attacked was striking evidence of the impression he was making and\nthe inward sense of his own powers; and the fact that he was working\nout his destiny according to the dictates of his own genius supported\nhim against this outpouring of prejudice and malice. The social side\nof life appealed to him more strongly as the years rolled on, and the\nmurmurings which had been heard in 1859 as to the socialistic\ntendencies of \"Death and the Woodman\" swelled to a roar when the\nstupendous \"Man with the Hoe\" was exhibited fourteen years later. The\nlatter, one of the most virile studies of depraved humanity which the\nworld has ever seen, has always been a favourite with social\nreformers, and has inspired one remarkable poem. Even his most\nimplacable critics were disarmed before this canvas; its power was\nmagnetic; it was an inspiration, soul moving and trenchant.\n\nHis financial difficulties never completely dispersed. At one time, in\norder to insure himself a little tranquillity, he made a contract with\ntwo speculators, whereby they were to become possessors of all the\nwork he produced for three years, in consideration of their assuring\nhim a thousand francs a month. A great number of Millet's finest\nproductions passed thus through their hands, including the \"Return\nfrom the Fields\" and the \"Man with the Hoe.\" The partners were not\nlong in quarrelling, and after a lawsuit had been fought, Millet was\nleft in the hands of a man who frequently would not or could not pay\nhim in ready money, and whose bills he was frequently forced to\ndiscount at considerable loss.\n\nOne little gleam of sunshine rendered his later days happy. This was a\ncommission from a Colmar banker, Monsieur Thomas by name, who required\nfour allegorical compositions representing the Seasons, to decorate\nhis rooms. The artist was overjoyed by this piece of good fortune,\nand immediately commenced a most conscientious study of such mural\ndecoration as was within reach, in order that he might do full justice\nto his patron. He paid frequent visits to Fontainebleau and the\nLouvre, and even desired a friend to inquire if he could not obtain\nreproductions of the frescoes at Herculaneum and Pompeii. In spite of\nall this elaborate preparation, the subjects were not such as appealed\nto his genius, and in spite of them being well and soundly painted, we\nare told that they presented no features which called for special\ncomment.\n\nHe found, however, a much more genial occupation in accomplishing a\nseries of drawings ordered by a Monsieur Gavet, who paid the artist\n1000, 700, and 450 francs each, according to their size. He made\naltogether ninety-five drawings in this way, and it is said that this\ngentleman had in his possession the finest work in black and white and\nwater-colour the artist ever executed.\n\nTowards the latter end of his life the death of dear relatives and\nfriends cast a sorrowful gloom over him. Amongst the latter Rousseau,\nwho expired in his presence on the 22nd of December 1867, was\nperhaps the loss which seemed to him hardest to bear. A staunch and\ntrusty friend, who was to be relied upon when his prospects seemed the\nmost hopeless, he had been one of the very few who had appreciated\nMillet's talents at their full worth, and who, moreover, scanty as his\nown means were, was ever ready to stretch out his hand to assist his\nstruggling friend.\n\nShortly afterwards Millet paid a visit to his patron, Herr Hartmann,\nat M\u00fcnster, and from here he went for a short time into Switzerland.\n\nUpon his return he devoted himself with great earnestness to work, and\nachieved a certain success at the Salons with his exhibits. The\noutbreak of the war with Germany caused him to migrate with his family\nto Cherbourg, where he thought he might continue to work, removed as\nfar as possible from the scenes of carnage and struggle which were\ngoing on farther east. Transported once more amongst the scenes of his\nchildhood, he felt an increased impetus to production, and when he\nreturned to Barbizon late in 1871, he brought with him a number of\ncanvases of the highest quality; conspicuous amongst them was the\nwonderful \"Gr\u00e9ville Church,\" now in the Louvre.\n\nThe anxieties of his troublous life were, however, beginning to show\ntheir effect upon his constitution; a persistent cough developed, and\nalthough an amelioration would occasionally occur, it was always\nsucceeded by a worse condition than before. His health suffered a\ngeneral decline, and he finally breathed his last on the 20th of\nJanuary 1875. He was buried in the little cemetery of Chailly, beside\nhis friend Rousseau, amidst the scenery they both loved so well.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE MAN AND HIS ART\n\n\nMillet is an instance of an artist working out his own destiny,\nimpelled by irresistible genius, in the teeth of seemingly\ninsurmountable obstacles. He started life with enormous disadvantages;\nwithout friends in influential circles to spread his fame or plead his\ncause; without money to enable him to outlive and triumph over the\nignorant fanaticism of critics and artists, so soaked in the\nconventionalised art of their time that they had not perception enough\nto appreciate the full meaning of that naturalistic movement, which\nwas finally to sweep away the quasi-classic art they boasted of with\nsuch bombastic effusion. The path was hard and thorny, and his triumph\nwas not finally consummated until after his death. He himself found\nhis only satisfaction in the fact that he had lived his life according\nto the dictates of his genius, and had achieved the maximum of which\nhe was capable.\n\nMillet and our own Cotman were somewhat kindred spirits; there is much\nmore affinity between the work of the two men than is apparent to any\none who has not closely studied them. The marvellous \"Breaking the\nClod,\" now happily permanently housed at the British Museum, betrays\nthe same tremendous conception and broad outlook which characterises\nmany a drawing of Millet's. Both highly strung to a painful extent,\nthey were each conscious of their inability to curb the power which\nprescribed a certain course for them, and in spite of pecuniary\ndifficulties and unpopularity, an inevitable result of their intense\noriginality, they pursued a steady course to the end of their lives.\n\nThe socialistic doctrines which have been read into the work of Millet\nare rather the outcome of the world's uneasy conscience being brought\nface to face with a crushing indictment of existing conditions, than\nof any design on the artist's part to further the cause of a political\npropaganda by means of his art. This somewhat extravagant reading into\nhis art has certainly been carried to excess. Particularly has such\nbeen the case in America, where a large number of his finest works are\nat present to be found, curiously enough in the hands of enormously\nwealthy people, who are frequently perhaps the least able to\nunderstand the real meaning of his message.\n\nComing from a peasant stock, his sympathies were always with the\npeasant; it was the only class he understood or cared for. He lived as\none of them, and shared to a large extent in their labour. He has been\ndesignated, not inappropriately, the philosopher in sabots. Rightly or\nwrongly he has come to be looked upon as one of the high priests of\ncommunistic doctrines. Few pictures have been so anathematised as the\n\"Man with the Hoe,\" and perhaps none have done more to inculcate\nsympathy with the degradation of the lower orders of the human race.\n\nThe revolting brutality and vacancy of that face haunts the\nimagination. Is it possible that fellow-creatures so utterly debased\nby toil and neglect exist? Millet dispels any doubt upon the question\nby bequeathing to humanity this trenchant portrait. By no means\nlimited to Barbizon or France, these poor creatures exist in every\ncountry, and curiously enough are considered an essential element in\neach country's development.\n\nThis poignantly human note is observable in almost every work Millet\nwrought; his passionate sympathy with his fellow-man is the keynote of\nhis art. The wood-cutter in his arduous toil, the shepherd in his\nsolitariness, the labourer turning the soil with unvarying and\nlaborious monotony, the mother caring for her children--all carry the\nsame message for him of that strange and incomprehensible mingling of\njoy and sadness we call life. Like many great minds before and since\nhis time, our artist found the greatest joy in life in a placid and\nnever changing melancholy. But the peasants he chose knew nothing of\nthe sadness he saw in them. Completely inured to their toil, and\nsubdued by it, with no refining or uplifting influence to stimulate\nthem, they knew nothing, aspired to nothing beyond what they were; it\nwas left to Millet to supply the \"might have been.\" He saw the inky\nblackness of the mind of the \"Man with the Hoe,\" the pathetic\ninequality between the mounted farmer directing the safe storage of\nhis crop, and the stooping figures of the \"Gleaners\" eager to scrape\nup the miserable crumbs which had fallen from the rich man's table. He\ntraced the lives of these simple folk until we arrive at the grim and\ngaunt figure of Death, who, as he grasps the woodman by the shoulder,\nreminds him that his course is finished and that he, in common with\nall his fellow-men, must enter the great unknown land from which there\nis no return. It is a sad and melancholy art, vibrating with purity\nand truth, the outpouring of a great soul yearning to express itself\nto the utmost of its power. The mind and character of the man can be\nread in every line and in every touch of the brush. His drawings and\netchings are even more searching in their virility than his pictures.\n\nThere is a spontaneousness about them we search for in vain in his\nwork in oil and pastel. In black and white his intensely emotional\nmind found a swift method of expression; in the laboriousness of oil\npainting he was fettered with the complications of the medium. It can\nbe fairly said that only in one or two paintings--a notable example\ncan be cited in the wondrous \"Sawyers\" at South Kensington--does he\nrise to the height of a great painter. Millet was a poet, a\nphilosopher, a great thinker, and the means he chose for expressing\nhimself were those which were best fitted to his purpose. His\npredilections in art were concentrated upon the greatest, and\nconsequently the men who appealed to him were the thinkers of the\nages. Mantegna and Correggio, Michel Angelo and the mighty Greeks,\nthese were the masters who left their impress upon his mind and art.\n\nThe influence of so sincere and profound an artist has necessarily\nbeen profound. He has moulded men who have achieved world-wide fame;\nSegantini, for example, would never have risen to the heights he did\nhad the example of Millet not been ever before him. There have been\nmany who, without possessing his genius, have endeavoured to follow\nin his footsteps, but successfully as his imitators have sometimes\ncaught his style, their productions can never live alongside his,\nbecause they lack the real ring of sincerity.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n        a. One bed, or folding cot,\n        b. One oil stove,\n        c. One lamp,\n        d. Enough supplies of all kinds sufficient for six months,\n        e. Pots, pans, kettles, etc.\nIt is needless to say that positions in Manila and Iloilo were now at\na premium.\n\nWas it possible that teachers were to be sent to places where even the\nnecessaries of life could not be obtained! Was it possible that many\nwould be sent to places so remote that for six months no fresh\nsupplies could be gotten! A mass meeting was held at once, and a\ncommittee was appointed to send a cablegram to the Associated Press\npetitioning aid from the American people at large. Realizing what\nconsternation would be created throughout the United States by such a\nmessage, two of the teachers leaped into a carriage at the close of\nthe meeting and a few moments later were closeted with the chief\nexecutive of the department. As a result the committee was persuaded\nnot to send the cablegram to the Associated Press until by courtesy it\nhad been sent to the President. Of course, this diplomatic move tided\naffairs over and the teachers who had flatly refused to budge from\nManila now agreed to go on to their stations, being assured that\nwhatever action was best would be taken.\n\nThe day had come when we must separate. We were to enter an untried\nand an unknown field. It was fitting that we have a final joyous\nmeeting, so the best orchestra in the archipelago was engaged and we\n\"chased the hours with flying feet\" until dawn so that whatever might\ncome to us in that unknown future upon which we were entering each\nwould hold in pleasant memory our last evening together.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER III. - A DRAMA IN ACTUAL LIFE.\n\n\nAlmost every one heeded the warning to go to his station forearmed\nwith at least necessaries of life, but, as it had never fallen to the\nlot of the writer to cook, he refused to learn at that late day, so he\ntook no pot, no pan, no kettle, putting his future into the hands of\nan uncertain fate and relying upon the unknown hospitality of the\nFilipino.\n\nBacalod, the capital of the province of Occidental Negros, was our\ndestination. The second morning after leaving Manila, we awoke with\nthe \"Kilpatrick\" lying at anchor in a shallow bay. We were several\nmiles from the shore and nothing in sight indicated that we had\nreached a place of any importance. Late the night before we had been\nawakened by the loud, sharp ringing of the ship's bells, accompanied\nby the reversal of the engines and a general disturbance awaking the\ncrew. So our first impressions on coming on deck were that we had run\naground. But the captain assured us that everything was ship-shape and\nthat this was the nearest point of approach to Capiz, a town of\nconsiderable importance on the island of Panay, where a body of troops\nwas to embark for home. Not even the grass hut of a native was in\nsight. Search as we would, not a sign was seen of a stream flowing\ninto the sea, indicating the probable presence of a town. There was\nnot a sign of life of any kind save one lone column of thin, blue\nsmoke that arose from the side of a mountain miles away. One would\nhave thought that we were explorers of three hundred years ago lying\noff the shore of some unknown land.\n\nAfter breakfast the steam launch, together with all the boats, was\nlowered, and several of us who had determined to miss no opportunity\nto gather information about the islands took our places in the launch\nby the side of the ship's mate, and steamed away across the water with\na long line of boats strung out in the rear. We headed away toward a\ngroup of cocoanut trees, and about an hour later stepped ashore on a\npile of decayed coral rocks that extended some twenty or thirty feet\nout into the water, thus forming the only landing place of a town of\nseveral thousands of people and of considerable commercial importance.\n\nA few moments after we had landed, an army wagon drawn by a\nmagnificent pair of mules came up out of a tropical jungle along a\nnarrow road. We clambered into the wagon and were soon lost in the\ndepths of foliage from which we had just seen the vehicle emerge.\n\nLong waving bamboos with their plumy leafage hung over the road from\neach side, meeting and overlapping in the center until they formed an\narchway so dense that the tropical sun now high in the heavens\npenetrated it only at intervals. At times the wagon sank up to the\nhubs in the soft earth, and the muscles of the mules stood out like\nwhip-cords under the skin as they drew us forward.\n\nAt a sharp turn in the road we came upon the first division of troops\nthat was to embark for home. The look of joy upon their sun-browned\nfaces was inexpressible. Their work was done, and with elastic step\nand smiling faces they saluted us as they passed by. The reign of\nforce was at an end; it was going out with them; the reign of peace\nhad begun; it was coming in with us.\n\nIn the afternoon when we returned from the town the last of the troops\nhad arrived and, as we drove up, the bugle was sounding the call to\nsupper. We noticed native women mingling with the troops and, indeed,\na native woman was in constant attention waiting upon one of the\nsoldiers with whom we ate. Her clothes were clean, her hair was nicely\ncombed, and her general appearance was neat. She seemed to anticipate\nthe slightest wish of the soldier with whom she was. She brought him\nwater to drink, cleaned his plate after the meal and saw that his\nknife, fork, and spoon were put into his haversack.\n\nWe had now finished supper and the launch had returned for the last\nload of troops. The lieutenant in command of the company gave the\norder to \"fall in\"; the men shouldered their rifles and fell into\nline. \"Forward, march!\" called the lieutenant, and the column swept\nforward towards the boats. The women had until now restrained\nthemselves, but, as their husbands marched away never to return, their\nfeelings could no longer be restrained. One young woman of about\neighteen, who was leaning against a rock by the roadside sobbing, when\nher husband passed, leaped up in frenzy of passionate love and caught\nthe rifle from his shoulder. Her first impulse seemed to be to throw\nthe gun away, but suddenly realizing the futility of such an act she\nburst into tears, shouldered the rifle herself and marched on by his\nside. Another woman of more mature age threw her arms around the legs\nof a tall stalwart man, and drew him bodily from the line.\n\nBut the troops marched on and entered the boats. One woman who had\nbeen unnoticed before came down into the shallow water and caught hold\nof our last boat as if to prevent its leaving, while others stood\nmingling their sobs with the sounds of the wavelets as they broke on\nthe sands. As we passed away, an expectant mother, standing in bold\noutline against the twilight sky, threw up her hands in an agony of\ndespair and then sank upon the stones. The curtain had fallen upon a\ndrama in actual life deeper in pathos than any other we had ever seen\nor ever expected to see. Depth of passion, depth of love! Who can\nfathom the human heart?\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. - WHAT THE TEACHERS DID.\n\n\nThere is a remarkable sameness about the towns in the Philippines.\n\nThey all have a large open square about the middle of the town, around\nthree sides of which are Chinese stores, unless one side lies open to\nthe sea, and on the fourth is the great stone ecclesia. The streets\nrun at right angles to one another and divide up the town into\ncreditable squares.\n\nEverybody in the Philippines lives up-stairs, for the ground is so\nsoaked with water during the rainy season that it is a menace to\nhealth to live upon the ground floor. So even the poorest nippa hut\nis built upon stakes four or five feet above the ground.\n\nBacalod is a typical Philippine town. As we landed, a broad open\nsquare was spread out before us. Two sides of the square were lined\nwith two-story houses in which were Chinese stores below and Filipino\nhomes above. On the third side stood the great stone church in whose\nmassive tower the clock was striking the hour of four, while the\nfourth lay open to the sea that had borne us thither.\n\nWe landed, but it was in a method new to us and one not usually\nemployed by the traveling public.\n\nWhen our sail boat ran aground on the sandy bottom a hundred yards or\nmore from the shore, a crowd of Filipino men who were on the beach\nslowly rolled up their pantaloons and waded out to the rescue,--for\nthe money that was in it. The boat's crew elevated their trousers'\nlegs also and slided down into the water. Each of us then straddled\nthe neck of a Filipino standing in the water and was held by ankles to\nbe steadied while our biped mounts proceeded to the shore.\n\nWe were now on the ground and face to face with the situation. To give\nthe reader an idea of the actual conditions met by the first teachers\nwho went to the Islands, the following is copied from the instructions\ngiven us in Manila:\n    1. There shall be two sessions daily of all schools, and the\n    last hour of the morning session shall be devoted solely to\n    instructing the Filipino teachers.\n\n    2. In cases where teachers are sent to a town in which there\n    is no school-house, they are expected to secure the aid of the\n    people and have one built.\n\n    3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is\n    stopped.\n\n    4. All supplies must be kept under lock and key. In towns\n    where there is no case or box to lock the supplies in, and it\n    is also impossible to get the town council to furnish a case,\n    a requisition may be sent to Manila, and, if an appropriation\n    can be secured, one will be made and sent out.\n\nThus it can be easily seen that we were indeed pioneers. In many\nplaces no school-house was to be found, and in some cases it was even\ndifficult to get the town council to provide a case in which to keep\nthe supplies.\n\nThe work of the teachers was, in short; to \"make the English language\nthe basis of instruction in the public schools.\" On our arrival at\nBacalod two schools were found in progress, for some soldiers had been\ndetailed for the work here previous to our coming. One of these was\nfor boys and the other, for girls. Thus the work here had been in a\nmeasure simplified, but complications that had arisen at Talisay, one\nof the largest and richest towns on the island, demanded a change of\nteachers and the writer was assigned to the place as superintendent.\n\nHere an attempt had been made to start a school but it had failed\nignominiously and a system of education was to be put into operation\nfrom the very start.\n\nThe Filipinos are not strong advocates of co-education, so separate\nschools were to be started for the boys and the girls. The one for the\nboys was gotten well in hand before the one for the girls was\nattempted at all.\n\nA few days after reaching the town and securing a home the\npresidente of the town had it publicly announced that the following\nMonday morning at eight o'clock a public school for boys would be\nopened in a building that had been rented for the purpose by the\nmunicipal council. About the middle of the afternoon of the same day a\nman beat a little drum throughout all the streets of the town to call\nthe people out and the town clerk announced both in Spanish and in the\nnative language that this public school would begin at the time and\nplace mentioned above; that instruction would be free to all who came;\nthat the government would furnish all supplies; and that instruction\nwould be given in the English language. A native principal and\nassistants were employed and everything was ready to begin.\n\nThe official report of the result is as follows:\n    Boys' public school of Talisay, Negros, P. I., began November\n    4, 1901. Forty-three boys present at eight o'clock. Forty-one\n    of them knew \"good morning\" and \"good afternoon\" but do not\n    know the distinction between them. Two of them speak simple\n    Spanish. At eight forty-five, eight more, who had been\n    attending an early morning private school, came in together.\n\n    The books they brought were so varied and so different from\n    one another that it seemed impossible to bring any reasonable\n    degree of order out of such a chaos, and so, after struggling\n    vainly for about a week with the problem, the superintendent\n    by one fell stroke removed everything in use and put in a\n    uniform system, and from that day on the English language has\n    been the basis of instruction in the public schools of\n    Talisay. The work was of necessity very slow at first, but by\n    the end of a year two schools were going nicely and a number\n    of the brightest boys and girls had made really excellent\n    progress.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER V. - A \"BAILE.\"\n\n\nNot long after the arrival of our party at Bacalod we received an\ninvitation to a \"baile\" given in our honor by the inhabitants of\nSilay, a town some ten or twelve miles up the northern coast and one\nnoted for its social life. The invitation was accepted with pleasure,\nand about the middle of the afternoon on the day appointed we were\nclad in the immaculate white of the tropics and steaming away up the\ncoast on board a launch sent for our conveyance. Twilight was still\nlingering on the path of day when we anchored just off shore at the\ntown. A row-boat containing the officials of the city came out to meet\nus and, in due season, we were ushered into a spacious drawing-room\nfilled almost to overflowing with the \u00e9lite of the town. The \u00e9lite of\ntowns in the Philippines speak Spanish, and, as only one or two of our\nparty could at that time boast of more than a formal acquaintance with\nthe Castilian tongue, the exchange of ideas that evening between us\nand the Filipinos was of necessity not very rapid.\n\nThe necessity of easy communication between us was rendered somewhat\nless indispensable by the announcement of supper as soon as we were\nrested from our trip. When we had taken our places at the table a\nyoung Filipino about twenty-five years of age arose and gave a lengthy\ntoast to the recent union of the Philippines with the United States.\n\nBut as we Americans were unable to scale the dizzy heights of his\nclimaxes or sink to the depths of his pathos, we forewent the\npleasures of his oratory and turned our attention to the savory odor\nof lamb, chicken, and roast pig that came slyly stealing up our\nnostrils to send us nerve dispatches about the gastronomic delights of\nour not far distant future.\n\nAt last the toast was ended and the world-wide soup ushered in a long\ntrain of things good to eat, served in a style better fitted to the\ndelights of the appetite than to the formalities of dinners, for, as\nsoon as the pleasant task of one dish was completed by any one, the\nnext was served him at once regardless of the progress made by the\nothers at the table.\n\nThe last course was dulce. The new-comers to the Philippines will\nnot be long in making the acquaintance of this dish, and at all\nmeetings, both public and private, where eatables are served, it\nperforms an important part. It is anything sweet, and it may vary all\nthe way from an india-rubber-like black mixture of cocoanut milk and\ndirty sugar to a really toothsome and respectable confection. No\nmatter of what materials a dish is composed, just so long as it is\nsweet, it is dulce.\n\nAfter paying our respects to this last course, we arose from the table\nand entered a great rectangular room from the center of whose ceiling\nhung a large glass chandelier, a mass of shimmering crystals. In the\nchairs around the room were the wealth, the youth, and the beauty of\nthe town.\n\nThe first and also the last number of every Filipino dance of any\nformality is the \"rigodon.\" The dancers are arranged in a square, or\nquadrangle according to the number participating, and are then led\nthrough a tangled maze of figures that so utterly bewilders the novice\nthat he sinks into his chair at the end of the dance wondering how it\nall came to pass.\n\nWe Americans breathed a sigh of relief when the \"rigodon\" ended, and\nmustered fresh courage for social conquests in the waltz that was now\nbreathing forth from the trembling strings. My companion in the first\ndance had been the young lady by whose side I had sat at dinner. But\nit now became necessary to search for another, so I prudently waited\nto see how partners were chosen, and made no mistake when a few\nmoments later I faced one of the most luscious looking se\u00f1oritas on\nthe opposite side of the room and offered her my arm. My eyes must\nhave told the story that my lips could not utter in Spanish, for she\nsmiled upon me sweetly, arose, and put her hand upon my shoulder. My\narm encircled her waist and I began to waltz. Unfortunately my\ncompanion did not follow, but began to hop up and down in a manner\nmost distressing. Supposing the attack to be only temporary, I paused\nand, much to my relief, she soon showed signs of recovery; and in the\ncourse of time she came to a standstill looking up into my face in an\ninquiring sort of way, apparently wondering why St. Vitus had not paid\nhis respects to me also. A second attempt to follow the music met with\nresults similar to the first, and during the third attempt, which\nseemed to be trembling on the verge of a failure, St. Vitus let go my\ncompanion and seized me with such vigor that she, who was small even\nfor a Filipino, was gathered up bodily and taken around the room at\nsuch a pace that her toes touched the floor only at far distant\nintervals.\n\nAt this point my devotion to the shrine of Terpsichore ceased from\nforce of circumstances and I seated myself in one of the most\ncomfortable chairs in sight that I might carry out a previously formed\nplan to study the Filipino somewhat critically as he appears in\nsociety.\n\nThe first thing that impressed me as the dancers passed up and down\nthe room was the flash of diamonds. Nearly every woman in the room had\non a brooch that flashed the colors of the rainbow at every turn.\n\nAlmost all of them wore one or more rings that showed up brilliantly\nunder the chandelier. Many of the men too, especially the young men,\nwore gems that appeared to be exquisite. A closer inspection showed\nthat some of the gems had flaws and others were of a poor color, but\nno one would have denied that, taken as a whole, it was a really\nbeautiful display.\n\nThe dress of the ladies was richly colored. Many of their skirts were\nof silk covered with hand embroidered flowers, and their filmy pina\nwaists and broad collar pieces were rich with needle-work. They all\nwore a kind of heelless velvet slipper, very common as a dress shoe in\nthe Philippines, or high-heeled patent leather shoes with neatly\nfitting black stockings.\n\nThe men were dressed in white coats and white pantaloons or black\ncoats and white pantaloons. White shirts and collars, together with\nall sorts and styles of cravats and low-cut patent leather shoes with\nhighly colored socks completed their dress.\n\nIt was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money;\nthat they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a\ntable loaded with good things was a fact to which all of us were\nenthusiastic witnesses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VI. - A SKETCH OF LIFE IN THE PHILIPPINES.\n\n\nHouse-keeping in the Philippines presents some interesting phases. Our\nclub of American officials decided to run a mess, so we employed a\ncook and a house boy, then each of us provided himself with a personal\nservant, making a total of six servants for four men--it takes about\nthis proportion of servants to live in any sort of comfort in the\nPhilippines--and launched ourselves boldly upon the sea of domestic\neconomy. But there were shoals ahead of us, for the question of\nregulating servants is one of no small importance in the Philippines,\nand one of its most disadvantageous features is the long chain of\ndependents that usually attends it.\n\nWe gave the cooks so much a day with which to buy supplies in the\nlocal market, for our own table, making him render a daily list of\nexpenditures, and a fixed amount besides to purchase rice and fish for\nhimself and the other servants. Of course, if they wished to vary\ntheir diet and get chicken and fresh pork, which could be had at far\ndistant intervals, it was wholly a matter of their option, but the\nallowance was made on the basis of so much rice and fish a day for\neach. This allowance was about fifteen cents a day in Spanish coin per\nservant.\n\nThus far all was well. We had agreed to give the cook eight dollars a\nmonth in Spanish money, thinking that good wages would procure good\nservice, but the visions of affluence that floated before him on such\nfloods of wealth were so alluring that they drew him from the kitchen\nto the cooler veranda. In less than a week he had employed an\nassistant at four dollars a month; in less than another week that\nassistant had employed him an assistant at two dollars a month; in\nless than another week that assistant to the assistant had employed\nhim an assistant at the princely salary of fifty cents a month; and\nfrom fear that the chain of dependents would end only by our having\nthe whole Filipino race attached to our culinary force, we broke up\nhouse-keeping and went boarding again, choosing that as the less of\nthe two evils.\n\nOur house furnishings were almost wholly Philippine. The table ware\nand the food on the table came from the ends of the earth. The knives\nand forks were made in Germany, the plates were manufactured in\nEngland, the glass ware and table cloth, in the United States. The\noatmeal and flour came from the United States also. The butter came\nfrom Australia, the rice from China, the salt from Russia, and the\nother eatables from sources about as various as their separate names.\n\nSwitzerland furnished the condensed milk and Illinois the canned\ncream. Nearly all of the canned fruit bore labels from Spain.\n\nThus it can easily be seen that life in the Philippines, if lived\naccording to American ideals, is dependent upon a highly developed and\nhighly complex commerce. However, the difficulties of transportation\nand the restriction of large stocks of merchandise to Manila and some\nhalf a dozen other towns, make so great a difference between country\nlife and city life that a short comparison of the two will not be out\nof place, and life in Manila may well be taken as being fairly typical\nof the latter.\n\nLife in Manila is pleasant, but expensive. It is pleasant from the\nfact that it is not only the capital but also metropolis of the\narchipelago. Thus the combination of wealth and high official position\nhas given to Manila a society of the highest and most refined type.\n\nThe process of beautifying and improving the city which is constantly\ngoing on bids fair to give us at no distant day a city of which we may\nwell be proud.\n\nBut let him who intends living well in Manila on a small income bid\nfarewell at once to so idylic a dream, for it costs much to live well\nthere. In the city of Manila one can get almost anything he wishes,\nbut it must be paid for at the price it commands. Especially in the\ncase of eatables, this price is by no means small, because to the\nfirst cost of articles must in most cases be added the expense of\ndistant shipment from American, European, or Australian ports, and not\ninfrequently the cost of long refrigeration must also be taken into\nconsideration. But, expensive though it is, it is very pleasant to\nlive there and those who have once enjoyed it often wish again to\nquaff the cup of its delights.\n\nIn strong contrast to this pleasant life is the life of the quiet\nlittle hamlet away in the distant islands. Indeed, the Filipino from\nthe distant town, who by some good fortune has been to Manila, or, by\na coup de main, has studied in one of the Manila colleges, is looked\nup to in a true hero-worshiping attitude by all who either know him or\nhear of his fame. Life in such a place is one long state of harmless\ninactivity. Not a wave of trouble from the great outer world ever\ndisturbs its peaceful repose. One lounges forever in an air of\nindolent ease and extreme aversion to anything approaching what might\nbe called a respectable effort.\n\nOne arises in the morning about the time the sun's first rays silver\nthe top leaves of the cocoanut trees and then stirs around until nine\nor ten o'clock, when it is found expedient to avoid a further exposure\nto the sun. From then until about five o'clock in the afternoon it is\nbest to take things as they come, even though one of those things be a\nFilipino dinner. But then you may have your vehiclo attached to a\nyoung bull with a ring in his nose and go for a drive. If it is the\ndry season you will probably enjoy the drive unless you object to the\nfrequent clouds of dust swept along by the evening wind. If it is in\nthe rainy season your pleasure will depend to a considerable extent\nupon how wet you get; but, whether the season be wet or dry, your\npleasure will be regulated largely by the state of harmony existing\nbetween the driver and the bull.\n\nIn these quiet secluded nooks successive generations of Filipinos are\nborn, reared, grow old and die in an even chain of events broken only\nby the occasional erection of a new grass house on the identical spot\nwhere its predecessors have stood for ages. The son lives in the house\nof his father, cultivates the same few square feet of soil planted in\nedible roots, climbs the same cocoanut trees, follows the same winding\npath down to the stream, pounds rice in the same mortar and with the\nsame stick that his ancestors have used from time unremembered, and,\nin case of illness, curls up on a grass mat in a corner of the room\nuntil he dies or by some good fortune recovers. Beyond this narrow\nhorizon he never looks. So narrow and contracted is the life that the\nlanguages of two towns a few miles apart are so different that one\nwould scarcely recognize them as belonging to the same race of people.\n\nSuch are the two extremes of life in our new far Eastern provinces:\nthe one is active, progressive, and cosmopolitan; the other, inactive,\ndecadent, and narrow; but, whether one enjoys the first or endures the\nsecond, there comes to him after leaving a longing to lounge again in\ntropic airs and listen to the lullaby of the winds among the palms.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VII. - THE FILIPINO AT HOME.\n\n\nAs one enters a Filipino sitting-room for the first time, there is one\nfeature in the arrangement of the furniture that impresses itself upon\nhim at once, and it may be stated without fear of serious\ncontradiction that this same peculiar feature in its arrangement will\ncontinue to face him, as he enters different homes, about as certainly\nas he crosses the threshold.\n\nThe arrangement referred to is that of one large mirror, one settee,\nand some ten or a dozen chairs that appear to have had a certain\norderly affection for one another. The mirror is hung upon one of the\nlarge interior parts of the house about four feet above the floor. The\nwooden houses in the Philippines are built by setting large posts\nupright into the ground, extending into the air from twenty to thirty\nfeet. Cross timbers are fastened to these upright posts about eight or\nten feet above the ground and then not sawed off even with the posts,\nbut allowed to extend beyond them each way. The framework of the house\nis built upon these extending cross timbers, a style of building by\nwhich these large upright posts are left standing out on the inside of\nthe room from one to three feet from the walls. It is on that one of\nthese posts most nearly opposite the door that the mirror always finds\nits place. Immediately beneath the mirror is the settee; and the\nchairs are arranged in two parallel lines facing one another and at\nright angles with the ends of the settee. However odd this arrangement\nmay appear to one when he first enters a Filipino drawing-room, there\nare two things to be said in its favor. In the first place, it places\nyou face to face with the person with whom you are conversing so that\nyou can watch him,--a matter of no small moment in the Philippines. In\nthe next place, it enables you to give one of the young ladies a\nsheep's-eye in the mirror while the others present are left where\nMoses was in our much abused conundrum.\n\nThe size of the residence and the quality of its furnishings depends\nupon the wealth of the owner. But there is so vast a difference\nbetween the mode of life of the highest class and the tao, or lowest\nclass, that it is well to speak of them separately, and the great\nmiddle class of Filipinos can easily be imagined to occupy the\nintervening ground.\n\nThe rich Filipino's house is usually of wood built upon a wall of\nstone or brick from ten to fifteen feet high. The floors are kept\nhighly polished in his hallway, dressing-room, and bed-rooms. There\nare, of course, no fire-places in any of the rooms, but on some\noccasions something is needed to dry the rain-soaked atmosphere, for\neven in the dry season it has been seen to rain for five successive\ndays and nights without the cessation of a moment.\n\nA long chain of dependents is attached to the household of the rich\nFilipino. The master has his special body servant to be present at all\ntimes to do his master's bidding, in short, to be the visible\nmechanism of his master's volition. So, too, the lady of the house has\nher servant woman to do the slightest bidding of her ladyship. Then\nthere is the cook who is almost invariably a man, a house boy or two,\nand the coachman. These functionaries, with their assistants and\nassistants to the assistants, together with a servant or two for the\nexclusive service of the children, complete the economic household.\n\nSuch a family has an abundance of rice and wheat bread, also of\nchicken and fish with occasional fresh beef. They have also a good\ndeal of dulce. They regularly serve wine and frequently serve beer\non their tables.\n\nIn strong contrast with this mode of life is that of the tao. His\ndiet consists almost wholly of rice and small uncleaned fish boiled\ntogether. As a rule knife, fork, plate, and spoon find no place in his\nhousehold. The rice and fish are boiled in a pot and then allowed to\ncool in the same vessel or poured out to cool in a large earthen or\nwooden bowl. Then Mr. Tao together with Mrs. Tao and all the young\nTaos squat on their heels around the mixture and satisfy that\nintangible thing called the appetite. They do not use chop sticks as\nthe Chinese do, but the rice and fish are caught in a hollow formed by\nthe first three fingers of the right hand. The thumb is then placed\nbehind the mass. It is raised up and poised before the mouth, with a\nskill coming from the evolution of ages, when a contraction of the\nmuscles of the thumb throws the mass into the mouth with a skill that\nis marvelous to any but a Filipino. To judge from the most reliable\ninformation, the poorest class do not have an abundance of food,\nalthough it would seem that such a condition of things would be\nwell-nigh impossible. However, in a census of one hundred school\nchildren there were found six boys and four girls who declared that\nthey had never had enough to eat, and the native teacher stated that\nthis was probably true.\n\nThe wide gulf between the tao and the rich man is filled by the\ngreat middle class of Filipinos.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VIII. - VISIT TO A LEPER COLONY.\n\n\nNot far from our town was a leper colony and the first Saturday that\ncould be spared was set aside for a trip to the place. It happened\nthat none of the other Americans were at leisure on this particular\nmorning, but, rather then delay the trip or miss it altogether, the\nwriter, armed with a revolver, started out alone.\n\nThe road had been described so accurately by one who was supposed to\nknow it that it was deemed well-nigh impossible to miss the way. The\nmain highway was followed to the point where the by-path supposed to\nlead to the settlement turned off through some bamboo thickets and a\nlow tropical wood. This path led straight away towards the sea-coast\nwhere the houses of the colony were said to stand in a cocoanut grove\nby the beach.\n\nUpon arriving at the settlement, a very inhospitable reception was\nreceived from a mangy cur that growled and showed a very uninviting\nset of sharp, white teeth behind his snarling lips. The growling of\nthe dog had attracted the attention of an old man who, with age-bent\nback, was pounding rice in a mortar about fifty yards away. He turned\nslowly around and, upon seeing an intruder into the primitive quiet of\nthe place, gave a sharp, far-reaching call. The sound had scarcely\nrung through the grove when from about a dozen of the little grass\nhouses dotted here and there fifteen or twenty men armed with bolos\ncame out and gathered around the old man. A sense of my danger flashed\nupon me. Three miles from town and alone in a tropical jungle, I could\nbe almost instantly overcome by this band of bolo-men, and the only\nreport that would ever reach my people would be that I had\n\"disappeared.\" Of course, attack was by no means certain, but the\npotentiality of the situation was thrilling. A drawn revolver and the\ngleaming of its shining barrel had the effect of stopping the men, who\nseemed to be hesitating as to a course of action, until a somewhat\ndignified retreat was made to an open space in the rear from where a\nless dignified and a more hasty retreat began which did not stop short\nof Bacalod.\n\nEnough had been seen, however, even in this short visit, to give\nconvincing proof that the settlement visited was no colony of lepers;\nso, that afternoon two servant boys being taken as guides and\ninterpreters, another attempt was made to reach the goal desired.\n\nThis attempt was successful, and, after about two hours of walking, a\nlittle cluster of grass huts snugly hidden by the sea-coast came into\nview. As we approached, one would have thought it a gala-day. Some few\nchildren, apparently from six to thirteen years of age, almost wholly\nnude, were romping and playing in the open space around which the huts\nstood, and no one would ever have thought that any cloud so horrible\nas leprosy could hover over a place apparently so happy.\n\nBy the side of the path as we passed was a man and his wife setting\nout potato plants. His hands were so puffed and his fingers so short\nthat he could scarcely use them, but he was working along as best he\ncould. His wife's feet were so swollen and twisted that she walked\nonly with the greatest difficulty. We passed them by and entered the\nopen space above referred to.\n\nThe children now saw us, and those of them who could darted away like\nfrightened rabbits, each to his own burrow. An old man who was sitting\nin the warm afternoon sun on the little bamboo platform before his hut\nwas aroused from his lethargic repose by the scampering away of the\nchildren. He arose, trembling upon his tottering limbs, all drawn and\ntwisted, and hobbled away into his hut.\n\nThe children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at\nthe doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of\nthe settlement. In a few moments we were surrounded by a circle of\nhuman beings at once so repulsive and so pitiable that its graphic\nvividness can never be accurately portrayed.\n\nThe old man referred to above, having put on a pair of snow-white\npantaloons, appeared now at the doorway of his hut, followed a few\nmoments later by his wife who had evidently clothed herself in the\nbest raiment she had. At a call from the old man, all the men, women,\nand children in the settlement came out of their huts and stood in a\nline before us. The old man was spokesman and in his native visayan\ntongue made a heart-rending appeal for aid which we were powerless to\ngive. Attention was called to a leper woman, apparently about\ntwenty-five years of age, whose face had been attacked by the disease\nand whose appearance was truly pathetic. Upon her hip was a child\nabout a year and a half old and, strange to say, the child showed as\nyet no signs whatever of the disease.\n\nWhat an indissoluble enigma is life! Here in a little cluster of grass\nhuts in a secluded nook of a secluded island of an all but secluded\narchipelago was gathered together a little community of wretched\nnatives, driven by their loathsomeness from association with others\neven of the same half-savage race. Yet here, men and women loved and\nwere married, by mutual trust if not by law, and children were born of\nthe union to live forever under the unspeakable horror that\novershadowed the unfortunate parents. Love, hatred, sorrow, and\njoy--every passion that enters into the complex structure of the human\nheart even here, in this scene of sadness and despair, was playing\napparently as freely as where misfortune and disease had never crossed\nthe portals of life.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER IX. - A \"HIKE.\"\n\n\nWe were lounging lazily in our hammocks at Jimamaylan one evening in\nApril. Supper was just ended, and the soldiers in the post were\ncollected in groups here and there spinning yarns to pass away the\ntime, when a Filipino clad only in a loin cloth came down the street\nat a steadily swinging run and stopped in front of the sentry. He\nbrought the announcement that a band of ladrones had just burned a\nsugar mill and were advancing to sack a barrio about fifteen miles\naway.\n\nThe invitation of the commanding officer to go on a \"hike\" was eagerly\naccepted, and, in ten minutes after the message was given, the troops\nwere on the march followed by two adventurous pedagogues.\n\nDarkness was just closing in as we left the town, but a resplendent\ntropic moon soon made the night almost as brilliant as the day. The\ntrail we followed led over rough and rocky country. Sometimes for a\ndistance of a mile or more we passed over barren wastes of volcanic\nslag poured out in anger by some peak whose convulsions have long\nsince ceased. Again we would descend into a tropical jungle from the\ndense foliage of which the ladrones could have leaped at any moment,\nhad they known of our coming, and annihilated our little band. We\nforded rapid streams with the water at our breasts, and halted only\nonce in that rapid march of fifteen miles.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the town we met a man who was standing\nguard against a surprise by the ladrones. Nothing could well have been\nmuch more grotesque and nothing could much better illustrate the\nabsolutely primitive condition of the Filipinos in the interior of the\nislands than the appearance of this guard. A pair of knee pants, a\nconical grass hat, and a hemp shirt formed his entire apparel. A long\nflat wooden shield, a bolo, and a long bamboo spear with a sharp,\nflat, iron point, completed his equipment for battle.\n\nHere stood the first and the twentieth centuries side by side. The\nFilipino who had advanced only a stage beyond the condition of\nprimitive man with his knife, spear, and wooden shield, stood side by\nside with the American soldier, a representative of modern life with\nhis magazine rifle, his canteen, his knapsack,--with every article of\nhis clothing made to give him the highest possible efficiency as the\nunit of a military organization.\n\nA few yards farther on we met another guard equipped similarly to the\nfirst. Upon reaching the town, news had just been received that a\ndetachment of troops from another post had intercepted the ladrones\nand fought a skirmish with them. The ladrones had escaped and we set\nout in pursuit of them on a chase wilder than a Quixotic dream. We\nwound our way into the mountains behind the town, inquiring at every\ngrass hut we passed whether the band of ladrones had passed that way,\nbut only once was even a trace of them found. Then it was learned that\nat a certain place they had separated into groups of three or four and\ngone glimmering through the dream of things that were. This place was\nin a secluded nook of the mountains where in years gone by some\nadventurous Spaniard had erected a primitive water mill to grind his\nsugar-cane. We had now marched about twenty miles and the feet of the\npedagogues were a mass of blisters. They had reached the point where\nthat form of military maneuvering called \"hiking\" ceased to possess\nany alluring charms. So a native was persuaded to come out of his lone\nmountain hut and hitch up his carabao and cart. He was then made to\nget on the carabao's back, while the aforesaid pedagogues lay down on\nthe sugar-cane pulp that had been put into the body of the cart, and\nthe driver was instructed to start for the post we had left hours\nbefore, and not to stop until he got there. Being uncertain but that\nsome of the ladrones would learn of our having left the body of troops\nand would try the metal of our steel, we at first agreed that neither\nof us should go to sleep, but it was later decided that probably the\ndriver had no greater desire to cross the Styx than his passengers had\nand that in case of danger he would awaken us, so both took a revolver\nin each hand, stretched out supinely and went to sleep.\n\nSuch a sleep! The rough jolting of the cart over an almost impassable\nroad was never enough to break the spell of slumber. When we awoke the\nblazing tropic sun was past the midday mark of morning, shining full\ninto our unprotected and well-nigh blistered faces.\n\nA pack of dogs were heralding our approach to a little village at the\nfoot of the mountains where ponies were procured to take us back to\nthe post."

                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently\nno time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth dimension of Space\nas a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house\nbecame quite quiet.\n\nOn reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up\nagainst a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realize\nhis position. Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\nhundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the\nDowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone\ninto hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains on\none of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who\nhad been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr\nto nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair\nby the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six\nweeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become\nreconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that\nnotorious sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible\nnight when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his\ndressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and\nconfessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox\nout of \u00a350,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card, and swore that\nthe ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back\nto him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because\nhe had seen a green hand tapping at the window-pane, to the beautiful\nLady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round\nher throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin,\nand who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of the\nKing's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he went\nover his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as\nhe recalled to mind his last appearance as \"Red Reuben, or the Strangled\nBabe,\" his d\u00e9but as \"Guant Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,\"\n\nand the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely\nplaying ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And\nafter all this some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him\nthe Rising Sun Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite\nunbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever been treated in this\nmanner. Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance, and remained till\ndaylight in an attitude of deep thought.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III\n\n\nThe next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed\nthe ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. \"I have\nno wish,\" he said, \"to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say\nthat, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,\"--a very just remark,\nat which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.\n\n\"Upon the other hand,\" he continued, \"if he really declines to use the\nRising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him. It\nwould be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside\nthe bedrooms.\"\n\nFor the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the\nblood-stain on the library floor. This certainly was very strange, as\nthe door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept\nclosely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a\ngood deal of comment. Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red,\nthen it would be vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came\ndown for family prayers, according to the simple rites of the Free\nAmerican Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright\nemerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party\nvery much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening. The\nonly person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia, who,\nfor some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the\nsight of the blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was\nemerald-green.\n\nThe second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in\nthe hall. Rushing down-stairs, they found that a large suit of old\narmour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone\nfloor, while seated in a high-backed chair was the Canterville ghost,\nrubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face. The\ntwins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged\ntwo pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained\nby long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United\nStates Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in\naccordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost\nstarted up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a\nmist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so\nleaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase\nhe recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of\ndemoniac laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely\nuseful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single\nnight, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French\ngovernesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly\nlaughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and\nrang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door\nopened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown. \"I am\nafraid you are far from well,\" she said, \"and have brought you a bottle\nof Doctor Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a\nmost excellent remedy.\" The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at\nonce to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an\naccomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family\ndoctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's\nuncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps,\nhowever, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself\nwith becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep\nchurchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.\n\nOn reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the\nmost violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross\nmaterialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what\nreally distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit\nof mail. He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by\nthe sight of a Spectre in armour, if for no more sensible reason, at\nleast out of respect for their natural poet Longfellow, over whose\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\nhour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides it was his own suit.\n\nHe had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament, and had\nbeen highly complimented on it by no less a person than the Virgin Queen\nherself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely overpowered\nby the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen\nheavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees severely, and\nbruising the knuckles of his right hand.\n\nFor some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of\nhis room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.\n\nHowever, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to\nmake a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his\nfamily. He selected Friday, August 17th, for his appearance, and spent\nmost of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in\nfavour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet\nfrilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards evening a\nviolent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was\njust such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to\nmake his way quietly to Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the\nfoot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\nof low music. He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville\nblood-stain by means of Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent. Having reduced\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and\nhis wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead,\nwhile he hissed into her trembling husband's ear the awful secrets of\nthe charnel-house. With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made\nup his mind. She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and\ngentle. A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more\nthan sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the\ncounterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins, he was quite\ndetermined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be done was, of\ncourse, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling\nsensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each\nother, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse,\ntill they became paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw off the\nwinding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white, bleached bones and\none rolling eyeball, in the character of \"Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's\nSkeleton,\" a r\u00f4le in which he had on more than one occasion produced a\ngreat effect, and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of\n\"Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.\"\n\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the\nlight-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves\nbefore they retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still,\nand, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the\nwindow-panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family\nslept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\ncould hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States. He\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his\nmurdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like\nan evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.\n\nOnce he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only\nthe baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange\nsixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\nin the midnight air. Finally he reached the corner of the passage that\nled to luckless Washington's room. For a moment he paused there, the\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's\nshroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was\ncome. He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had\nhe done so than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid\nhis blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was\nstanding a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous\nas a madman's dream! Its head was bald and burnished; its face round,\nand fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\nfeatures into an eternal grin. From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\nlight, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like\nto his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form. On its breast\nwas a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of\nshame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime,\nand, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\n\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's\njack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler. Once in the\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small\npallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes. After a time, however,\nthe brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to\ngo and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight. Accordingly,\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling\nthat, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid\nof his new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins. On reaching\nthe spot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had\nevidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from\nits hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it\nwas leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable\nattitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his\nhorror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a\nrecumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity\nbed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow\nturnip lying at his feet! Unable to understand this curious\ntransformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there,\nin the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:--\n        +------------------------------------+\n        |         YE OTIS GHOSTE             |\n        | Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook, |\n        |    Beware of Ye Imitationes.       |\n        |   All others are counterfeite.     |\n        +------------------------------------+\nThe whole thing flashed across him. He had been tricked, foiled, and\nout-witted! The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his\ntoothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his\nhead, swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\nschool, that, when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds\nof blood would be wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.\n\nHardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of\na distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh,\nand waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\nreason, did not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back\nto his room, thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose. There he\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was\nexceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which this oath\nhad been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second time. \"Perdition\nseize the naughty fowl,\" he muttered, \"I have seen the day when, with my\nstout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow\nfor me an 'twere in death!\" He then retired to a comfortable lead\ncoffin, and stayed there till evening.\n\n\nCHAPTER: IV\n\n\nThe next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were\ncompletely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five\ndays he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point\nof the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want\nit, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a\nlow, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating\nthe symbolic value of sensuous phenomena. The question of phantasmic\napparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a\ndifferent matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large\noriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every month, and he\ndid not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is\nquite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand,\nhe was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.\n\nFor the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as\nusual between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible\nprecaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots,\ntrod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large\nblack velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for\noiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good\ndeal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of\nprotection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he\nslipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a\nlittle humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see\nthat there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a\ncertain degree, it served his purpose. Still in spite of everything he\nwas not left unmolested. Strings were continually being stretched across\nthe corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion,\nwhile dressed for the part of \"Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley\nWoods,\" he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide,\nwhich the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry\nChamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged\nhim, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and\nsocial position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the\nnext night in his celebrated character of \"Reckless Rupert, or the\nHeadless Earl.\"\n\nHe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in\nfact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means\nof it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord\nCanterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome\nJack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\ndown the terrace at twilight. Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\nLord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken\nheart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it\nhad been a great success. It was, however an extremely difficult\n\"make-up,\" if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more\nscientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three\nhours to make his preparations. At last everything was ready, and he was\nvery pleased with his appearance. The big leather riding-boots that went\nwith the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\nfind one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite\nsatisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting\nand crept down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins,\nwhich I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of\nthe colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make\nan effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water\nfell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his\nleft shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed. The shock to his\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\ncould go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold. The only\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\nhad not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences\nmight have been very serious.\n\nHe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,\nand contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in\nlist slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\ndraughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the\ntwins. The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September. He\nhad gone down-stairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that\nthere, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing\nhimself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of\nthe United States Minister and his wife which had now taken the place of\nthe Canterville family pictures. He was simply but neatly clad in a long\nshroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip\nof yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In\nfact, he was dressed for the character of \"Jonas the Graveless, or the\nCorpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,\" one of his most remarkable\nimpersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to\nremember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their\nneighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a quarter-past two o'clock in\nthe morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring. As\nhe was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any\ntraces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a\ndark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads,\nand shrieked out \"BOO!\" in his ear.\n\nSeized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural,\nhe rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him\nthere with the big garden-syringe, and being thus hemmed in by his\nenemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the\ngreat iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to\nmake his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own\nroom in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.\n\nAfter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins\nlay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\nservants, but it was of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings\nwere so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed\nhis great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had\nbeen engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized a wonderful\nclam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse\neuchre, poker, and other American national games, and Virginia rode\nabout the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire,\nwho had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville\nChase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in\nfact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who,\nin reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best\ncongratulations to the Minister's worthy wife.\n\nThe Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the\nhouse, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let\nmatters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the\nyoung Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had\nonce bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice\nwith the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the\nfloor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state that, though\nhe lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but\n\"Double Sixes.\" The story was well known at the time, though, of course,\nout of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt\nwas made to hush it up, and a full account of all the circumstances\nconnected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle's\nRecollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends. The ghost, then,\nwas naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence\nover the Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his\nown first cousin having been married en secondes noces to the Sieur de\nBulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are\nlineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to\nVirginia's little lover in his celebrated impersonation of \"The Vampire\nMonk, or the Bloodless Benedictine,\" a performance so horrible that when\nold Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in\nthe year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which\nculminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after\ndisinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and\nleaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment,\nhowever, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the\nlittle Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal\nBedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.\n\n\nCHAPTER: V\n\n\nA few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out\nriding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting\nthrough a hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go\nup by the back staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past\nthe Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied\nshe saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother's maid, who\nsometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend\nher habit. To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville\nGhost himself! He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of\nthe yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing\nmadly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his hand, and his\nwhole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so forlorn, and so\nmuch out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea\nhad been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity,\nand determined to try and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so\ndeep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she\nspoke to him.\n\n\"I am so sorry for you,\" she said, \"but my brothers are going back to\nEton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy\nyou.\"\n\n\"It is absurd asking me to behave myself,\" he answered, looking round in\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,\n\"quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and\nwalk about at night, if that is what you mean. It is my only reason for\nexisting.\"\n\n\"It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very\nwicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had\nkilled your wife.\"\n\n\"Well, I quite admit it,\" said the Ghost, petulantly, \"but it was a\npurely family matter, and concerned no one else.\"\n\n\"It is very wrong to kill any one,\" said Virginia, who at times had a\nsweet puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.\n\n\"Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very\nplain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about\ncookery. Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent\npricket, and do you know how she had it sent to table? However, it is\nno matter now, for it is all over, and I don't think it was very nice of\nher brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.\"\n\n\"Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost--I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry? I\nhave a sandwich in my case. Would you like it?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you,\nall the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\nvulgar, dishonest family.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Virginia, stamping her foot, \"it is you who are rude, and\nhorrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the\npaints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain\nin the library. First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and\nI couldn't do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the\nchrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese\nwhite, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing\nto look at, and not at all easy to paint. I never told on you, though I\nwas very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for\nwho ever heard of emerald-green blood?\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" said the Ghost, rather meekly, \"what was I to do? It is\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother\nbegan it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I\nshould not have your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of\ntaste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest\nin England; but I know you Americans don't care for things of this\nkind.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\nand improve your mind. My father will be only too happy to give you a\nfree passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind,\nthere will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are\nall Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\nhave a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family ghost.\"\n\n\"I don't think I should like America.\"\n\n\"I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,\" said Virginia,\nsatirically.\n\n\"No ruins! no curiosities!\" answered the Ghost; \"you have your navy and\nyour manners.\"\n\n\"Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week's\nholiday.\"\n\n\"Please don't go, Miss Virginia,\" he cried; \"I am so lonely and so\nunhappy, and I really don't know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I\ncannot.\"\n\n\"That's quite absurd! You have merely to go to bed and blow out the\ncandle. It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\nchurch, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why, even\nbabies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.\"\n\n\"I have not slept for three hundred years,\" he said sadly, and\nVirginia's beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; \"for three hundred\nyears I have not slept, and I am so tired.\"\n\nVirginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like\nrose-leaves. She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked\nup into his old withered face.\n\n\"Poor, poor Ghost,\" she murmured; \"have you no place where you can\nsleep?\"\n\n\"Far away beyond the pine-woods,\" he answered, in a low, dreamy voice,\n\"there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\nsings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold crystal\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\nsleepers.\"\n\nVirginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\n\n\"You mean the Garden of Death,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth,\nwith the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have\nno yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at\npeace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of death's\nhouse, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death\nis.\"\n\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\nthere was silence. She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\n\nThen the ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of\nthe wind.\n\n\"Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?\"\n\n\"Oh, often,\" cried the little girl, looking up; \"I know it quite well.\n\nIt is painted in curious black letters, and is difficult to read. There\nare only six lines:\n    \"'When a golden girl can win\n    Prayer from out the lips of sin,\n    When the barren almond bears,\n    And a little child gives away its tears,\n    Then shall all the house be still\n    And peace come to Canterville.'\n\n\"But I don't know what they mean.\"\n\n\"They mean,\" he said, sadly, \"that you must weep with me for my sins,\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle,\nthe angel of death will have mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\ncannot prevail.\"\n\nVirginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair\nas he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes. \"I am not afraid,\" she said\nfirmly, \"and I will ask the angel to have mercy on you.\"\n\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as\nhe led her across the dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were\nbroidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back. \"Go back! little Virginia,\"\n\nthey cried, \"go back!\" but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly,\nand she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails\nand goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and\nmurmured, \"Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,\"\n\nbut the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When\nthey reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she\ncould not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly\nfading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A\nbitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her\ndress. \"Quick, quick,\" cried the Ghost, \"or it will be too late,\" and\nin a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry\nChamber was empty.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VI\n\n\nAbout ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not\ncome down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia\nanywhere. As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\nevening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all\nalarmed at first, but when six o'clock struck, and Virginia did not\nappear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for\nher, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house. At\nhalf-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\nof their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of\nexcitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly\nremembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies\npermission to camp in the park. He accordingly at once set off for\nBlackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son\nand two of the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire, who was\nperfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too,\nbut Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a\nscuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gipsies had\ngone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as\nthe fire was still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.\n\nHaving sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran\nhome, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the\ncounty, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been\nkidnapped by tramps or gipsies. He then ordered his horse to be brought\nround, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down\nto dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with a groom. He had hardly,\nhowever, gone a couple of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after\nhim, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with\nhis face very flushed, and no hat. \"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,\" gasped\nout the boy, \"but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.\n\nPlease don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year,\nthere would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me back,\nwill you? I can't go! I won't go!\"\n\nThe Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace,\nand was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down\nfrom his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, \"Well,\nCecil, if you won't go back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must\nget you a hat at Ascot.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!\" cried the little Duke, laughing,\nand they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of\nthe station-master if any one answering to the description of Virginia\nhad been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her. The\nstation-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him\nthat a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a\nhat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his\nshutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away,\nwhich he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as there was a\nlarge common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman, but\ncould get no information from him, and, after riding all over the\ncommon, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase\nabout eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found\nWashington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with\nlanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest trace of\nVirginia had been discovered. The gipsies had been caught on Brockley\nmeadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they should be late. Indeed, they had\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's disappearance, as they\nwere very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his\npark, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search.\n\nThe carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone\nover, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any\nrate, Virginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest\ndepression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they\nfound a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\nwas poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and\nhaving her forehead bathed with eau de cologne by the old housekeeper.\n\nMr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up\nsupper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one\nspoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very\nfond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the\nentreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that\nnothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in\nthe morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down\nimmediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight\nbegan to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded\nthey heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder\nshook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a\npanel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out\non the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her\nhand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs.\nOtis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with\nviolent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.\n\n\"Good heavens! child, where have you been?\" said Mr. Otis, rather\nangrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them.\n\n\"Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and\nyour mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these\npractical jokes any more.\"\n\n\"Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!\" shrieked the twins, as they\ncapered about.\n\n\"My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side\nagain,\" murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair.\n\n\"Papa,\" said Virginia, quietly, \"I have been with the Ghost. He is dead,\nand you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was\nreally sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of\nbeautiful jewels before he died.\"\n\nThe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave\nand serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a\nlighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they\ncame to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia\ntouched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves\nin a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated\nwindow. Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was\na gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone\nfloor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers\nan old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its\nreach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was\ncovered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but\na pile of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding\nher little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the\nparty looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\ndisclosed to them.\n\n\"Hallo!\" suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out\nof the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\nsituated. \"Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.\"\n\n\"God has forgiven him,\" said Virginia, gravely, as she rose to her feet,\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.\n\n\"What an angel you are!\" cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round\nher neck, and kissed her.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VII\n\n\nFour days after these curious incidents, a funeral started from\nCanterville Chase at about eleven o'clock at night. The hearse was drawn\nby eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\nnodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\npurple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville\ncoat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\nservants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully\nimpressive. Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up\nspecially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first\ncarriage along with little Virginia. Then came the United States\nMinister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the\nlast carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had\nbeen frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she\nhad a right to see the last of him. A deep grave had been dug in the\ncorner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service\nwas read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, the servants, according to an old custom\nobserved in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as\nthe coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward,\nand laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms. As\nshe did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its\nsilent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a\nnightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of the\nGarden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a\nword during the drive home.\n\nThe next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given\nto Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby\nnecklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen\nof sixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis\nfelt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"I know that in this country mortmain is held to\napply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that\nthese jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg\nyou, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you\nunder certain strange conditions. As for my daughter, she is merely a\nchild, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such\nappurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I\nmay say, is no mean authority upon Art,--having had the privilege of\nspending several winters in Boston when she was a girl,--that these gems\nare of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\nprice. Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you\nwill recognize how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\nin the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such\nvain gauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\nBritish aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who\nhave been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles\nof Republican simplicity. Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box, as a memento of\nyour unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is extremely old, and\nconsequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to\ncomply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good deal\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with medi\u00e6valism\nin any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was\nborn in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned\nfrom a trip to Athens.\"\n\nLord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister's speech,\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile,\nand when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\nsaid: \"My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky\nancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are\nmuch indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck. The jewels\nare clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough\nto take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave\nin a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. As for their being\nheirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or\nlegal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite\nunknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and\nwhen Miss Virginia grows up, I dare say she will be pleased to have\npretty things to wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the\nfurniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to\nthe ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity\nSir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he\nwas really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase.\"\n\nMr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville's refusal, and\nbegged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was\nquite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to\nretain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of\n1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's first\ndrawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the\nuniversal theme of admiration. For Virginia received the coronet, which\nis the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her\nboy-lover as soon as he came of age. They were both so charming, and\nthey loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the\nmatch, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch\nthe Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less\nthan three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to\nsay, Mr. Otis himself. Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke\npersonally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his\nown words, \"was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating\ninfluences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of\nRepublican simplicity should be forgotten.\" His objections, however,\nwere completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the\naisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his\narm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of\nEngland.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to\nCanterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over\nin the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods. There had\nbeen a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir\nSimon's tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it\nsimply the initials of the old gentleman's name, and the verse from the\nlibrary window. The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses,\nwhich she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for\nsome time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There\nthe Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her\nfeet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly\nhe threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her,\n\"Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.\"\n\n\"Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have,\" he answered, smiling, \"you have never told me what\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.\"\n\n\"I have never told any one, Cecil,\" said Virginia, gravely.\n\n\"I know that, but you might tell me.\"\n\n\"Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you. Poor Sir Simon! I owe\nhim a great deal. Yes, don't laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see\nwhat Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than\nboth.\"\n\nThe Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.\n\n\"You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,\" he murmured.\n\n\"You have always had that, Cecil.\"\n\n\"And you will tell our children some day, won't you?\"\n\nVirginia blushed.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.\n\nYet Millet would have us understand that in spite of this, the\nshepherd is performing a duty to humanity not to be underrated. The\nsheep he has so carefully and conscientiously reared will form food\nto-morrow for many a hungry town-dweller. Further, he would have us\nfollow the peasant as he closes the pen for the night and traces his\ntired steps towards his simple home in the village. The frugal and\nhard-earned meal, prepared for him by his wife, who like himself has\nhad her share of duties to occupy her during the day, is partaken of\nsurrounded by a hungry and joyous group of children. Such themes\nsuggested by the simplicity of his own life appealed to him with\nirresistible force, and it is in their portrayal that his greatness is\nmanifested.\n\nPerhaps no season of the year presented the same attraction for Millet\nas the spring. The period when all the earth after its long winter\nsleep is about to waken into new life seems to have always been a\nsource of inspiration to him. In \"The Sower\" he emphasises the fact\nthat the fruits of the harvest are not to be had without due labour\nbeing expended upon the earth. The sloping field, barren of\nvegetation, and crowned at the top with a small clump of trees, is\nbeing broken up by the distant plough drawn by two horses and guided\nby a peasant. The latter figure is one of the noblest of Millet's\ncreations. By his strained and ever-attentive attitude, by his\ncontinuous tramp over the rough and broken ground, he shows us the\nmonotony of his toil. He crosses the field in one direction, only to\nreturn at an interval of a few feet. In the foreground we have the\nsower, a middle-aged man of typical peasant type, on whose left side a\nbag of seeds is slung. With automatic precision he withdraws a\nhandful, and strews it into the furrows open to receive it. So long as\nhe continues in the same track his labour will be well performed, and\nhence his task is just as monotonous as that of his fellow-worker\nhigher up in the field. The silhouetting of these two figures against\nthe light is symbolical of the labour to be expended in life before\nresults are forthcoming.\n\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that in considering the works of\nMillet, one must not judge him from the standpoint of a mere painter.\n\nHis brush is only the means to an end, and by its means he is enabled\nto bring the fruits of his philosophic observation before us in\npermanent form. It has been charged against the \"Angelus\" that it was\nnot a remarkably fine piece of painting, that many a young artist of\nthe present generation is infinitely better equipped, technically\nspeaking, than the master who wrought this celebrated canvas. This may\nin a measure be true, but it must never be forgotten that Millet\nbrought into play exactly the means which could illustrate his meaning\nin the clearest terms. He had not intended, in painting such a\npicture, to produce a work which would astonish his fellow artists\nwith its brilliancy of handling or magnificence of colour. He wanted\nto make the beholder forget the painter and absorb the lesson. This\nquality runs right through the art of Millet, and it is from this\nstandpoint that we are obliged to weigh his merits.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE\n\n\nJean Fran\u00e7ois Millet was born on October 4, 1814, that is at the\nperiod when French art, at any rate as far as landscape painting is\nconcerned, had reached its lowest ebb. Throughout the eighteenth\ncentury the landscape painter had been hard put to make a living. The\ntaste of connoisseurs throughout the century had been for portraits\nand interiors, or for those numerous pastoral subjects which were\ncarried out with so much decorative charm by such men as Watteau and\nBoucher. Such landscape painting as existed was of the type\npopularised by Vernet; it was built upon a curious mixture of Italian\ninfluence coming from Panini and Salvator Rosa. The only evidence of\nrevolt against such a state of affairs we find in the works of Hubert\nRobert and Moreau. These two, and more especially would I direct the\nreader's attention to the latter, struggled hard to break down the\nconventionalities of the time. They endeavoured to infuse some sense\nof atmosphere into their pictures, and whilst frequently their trees\nand figures are painfully formal, they yet stand alone in the French\nschool as the pioneers of a phase of art which was to attain its\nzenith in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBut after the Revolution, and during the whole of the time that France\nwas under the domination of Napoleon, very rigid principles indeed\nwere enforced with regard to the direction that art should take. The\ninnovation which had its commencement in the reign of Louis XVI. swept\neverything before it as it gained force. Classical art and traditions\ndominated the whole French school, and no artist, however great his\nreputation, attempted for many years to swim against the stream. In\nspite of the principles of liberty and equality which were claimed for\nall under the new r\u00e9gime, a terribly strict eye was kept upon any\ninnovations which might break out in the form of a naturalistic art.\n\nThe directors of this new movement failed to see that the conditions\nwhich had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed\naway, and that the latter's supremacy was due to the fact that their\nproductions were symbolical of the loftiest thoughts of their own\nepoch. The art which expresses the ambitions and noblest thoughts of\nits time will alone endure. These expressions are not applicable to\nany other condition than those which called them forth, and hence in\nattempting to purify the rococo which had existed up to the middle of\nthe eighteenth century, by a return to classical traditions, they were\nonly copying that which their predecessors had done, and in so doing\nleft us without any original expression of their own time.\n\nInto such a condition of affairs was Millet born, and he was numbered\namongst that little band of men which included Rousseau, Corot, Dupr\u00e9,\nDiaz, and Daumier, who were to lay the foundations of the modern\nnaturalistic school. At the outset it was seemingly a hopeless\nstruggle they undertook; a struggle against prejudice and influence\nwhich was only to be brought to a victorious culmination after years\nof struggle and disappointment. Of this little band, Millet was\nperhaps the best equipped for the privations which were necessary. He\ncame of a peasant stock who inhabited Gruchy, a small village\nsituated in the commune of Gr\u00e9ville, close to Cherbourg. Grouped\nunderneath the humble roof was the grandmother, who had been left a\nwidow fifteen years before; her son, Jean Louis Nicolas Millet, and\nhis wife and eight children, of which our artist was the second. His\ngrandmother appears to have been a pious old lady, whose chief delight\nwas in her grandchildren, to whom she taught those religious\nprinciples which stood them in good stead in after life. We are told\nthat Millet's father possessed a force of character one does not often\nfind amongst men in his rank of life. He was of a contemplative\ndisposition, and had a keenly developed feeling for natural beauty. He\npossessed moreover a keen appreciation of music, which unfortunately\nhe does not appear to have had much opportunity of cultivating. His\nwife was an excellent housewife and of a religious turn of mind. The\nhouse they occupied, situated quite a short distance from the sea, was\nplaced in a tract of country which, whilst it had rugged and\npicturesque features, was not of a nature which would yield\nextraordinary results under cultivation. It was, therefore, a hard\nstruggle for existence which Millet in his first years saw going\non around him. Not that the family were any the less happy for having\nto work laboriously for their livelihood. They had been brought up\namidst such surroundings; their wants were simple and easily\ngratified, and the tranquillity of the m\u00e9nage more than\ncounterbalanced those doubtful luxuries which easier circumstances\nwould have brought their way. Throughout his life Millet maintained\nthe extreme simplicity he had seen practised in the home of his\nchildhood, and long years afterwards he was accustomed to look back\nwith pleasureable memories upon his early years.\n\nGruchy, situated in one of the wildest parts of Normandy, feels the\nfull effect of every storm which blows up from the Atlantic. There is\nnothing to shelter the exposed hamlets studded along the coast from\nthe fury of the western gale, and the rocks are but too often strewn\nwith the wrecks of vessels which have come to grief in that terrible\nsea. Millet in his youth must have witnessed many of these\ncatastrophes. Quite a number of drawings by him are extant\nrepresenting succour being extended to some vessel in difficulties, or\nthe hauling up of some wreckage on to the rocks. The studious boy\nmust have been impressed as he saw the sternness of the combat in his\nnative country between men and nature; the wind-swept fields, and\nhills bare to the point of savageness. The very trees themselves\ndwarfed and gnarled; in their struggle with the elements they have\nbeen made tough and hardy as the inhabitants of the country\nthemselves, and, stunted as they are, yet show well that they can\nresist the force of the fiercest storm. The brooding and contemplative\ncharacter of the father having descended to the son, we can quite\nimagine the effect such surroundings would have upon him. As he looked\nback in after years upon his roamings in his native country, he\nappreciated the awe-inspiring character of the scenery in which he had\nbeen born. He would doubtless recall many a walk amidst the fields\nwith the wind blowing in his face as it rushed in from the Atlantic,\nthe rain beating hard upon the freshly ploughed fields, and the\ndistant figure of the ploughman struggling hard with his team against\nthe stiff sou'wester. The great mass of vapour overhead whirled before\nthe violence of the storm, casting grey and pearly light over the\nwhole scene, whilst far away on the top of the hill a clump of trees,\nbent with their resistance to the wind, are silhouetted against the\nsky. Many a drawing of this kind we encounter in the later work of\nMillet, which shows how his thoughts harked back in certain moments to\nthe scenes he had left behind him for ever.\n\nWe know that on one or two occasions he returned to Gruchy. Once or\ntwice he had urgent business which took him back, but sometimes he\nwent with no other purpose than to renew acquaintance with the scenes\nof yore.\n\nLittle Jean Fran\u00e7ois was his grandmother's favourite. It was she who\ntaught him the names of things which surrounded him, and perhaps\ndirected his thoughts in the channels to which they were finally to be\ndevoted. Her brother Charles, who formed one of the family, used to\ntake him for walks, telling him stories on the way. Millet was\ndevotedly attached to this old man, and when at the age of seven years\nhe lost him, the gap in his life thus left made an impression upon his\nmemory never to be effaced.\n\nFive years afterwards he was placed in the hands of the vicar for the\npurpose of preparing him for his first communion. The good man seems\nto have been taken with the child; he found him so attentive to all\nnatural phenomenon which was passing around him and intelligent in an\nunusual degree. He quickly learnt a considerable amount of Latin,\nwhich introduced him to the great classics. Unfortunately for Millet,\nthe vicar accepted an offer of transference to a better parish in the\nvicinity. The boy had made such progress with his master that it was\ndecided that he should go with him to his new abode. He was, however,\nso missed in his own home, that when he came back for his first\nholidays it was decided that he should not return.\n\nHe now gave serious attention to the agricultural pursuits of his\nfather. He threw himself heartily into the work of the farm, and\nassisted in the work of sowing and harvesting, of pruning and\nthrashing according to the season. His spare time was occupied in\nreading with avidity various masterpieces of literature. The authors\nhe found at hand were such as F\u00e9n\u00e9lon and Bossuet, but he developed a\ndecided preference, which lasted till the end of his life, for Virgil\nand the Bible.\n\nIt was at this time that his taste for art began to be developed.\n\nHe drew the objects he found around him, and soon acquired sufficient\nconfidence in his skill to execute a large drawing representing two\nshepherds keeping guard over their sheep. These first efforts date\nfrom about his seventeenth year, and foretell the advent of the style\nin which he was later to become pre-eminent.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE MIGRATION TO PARIS\n\n\nHow frequently has it happened that the first years in the life of a\ngenius have been employed in labour quite different from that to which\nthey should have been directed. Such a state of affairs the more often\noccurs when the sense of duty has been strong enough to overcome\ntemporarily the inclination to pursue the natural bent. In the case of\nMillet, however, the early years which he devoted to the farm and its\npursuits were by no means wasted. It is on record that he became very\nproficient in the various duties in which he was engaged, but at the\nsame time we can be quite sure that his extraordinary faculties of\nobservation were constantly being brought into play, and the fruits of\nhis observations are to be seen in the pictures of his mature period.\n\nA considerable portion of his spare time was taken up with drawing,\nnot only the persons and objects he found around him, but also\nsubjects suggested to him by the books he was in the habit of reading.\n\nHis family, so far from throwing any obstacles in his way, encouraged\nhim. In fact it was his father who took him first to Cherbourg in\norder to show a painter of that town, named Mouchel, the early\nproducts of his son's genius. The decision at which Millet p\u00e8re had\narrived was prompted by a drawing in charcoal of an old peasant\nwalking along the road, which had struck him forcibly as being a work\nof extraordinary merit. It says much for Mouchel's breadth of mind\nthat he was equally impressed with the drawings. A man who had been\nbrought up in the school of David, and who had lived in one of the\nmost reactionary periods of French art, was hardly to be expected to\ntake kindly to a style so diametrically opposed to all the traditions\ninto which he himself had been inculcated; certainly the young\nMillet, who had now arrived at the age of eighteen, had not developed\nthe extraordinary freedom which his works of ten years later\ndemonstrate. But there was sufficient originality even in his early\ndrawings to call forth condemnation from a man who had been so\nsaturated with the teaching of David.\n\nHe prevailed upon Millet to leave his son with him, and set him to\nwork to copy many well-known works of art which he brought before his\npupil by means of engravings. Two months were spent in this way when\nnews reached Millet that his father had been seized with sudden\nillness, and he was obliged in the circumstances to return to\nGr\u00e9ville. He arrived to find the old man unconscious, and very shortly\nafterwards he died.\n\nThis misfortune awoke in Millet a sense of duty which compelled him to\ndesert his studies in Cherbourg and superintend the management of the\nfarm. For some time he devoted himself entirely to his new duties, but\nthe struggle betwixt duty and genius continued; he gave himself to his\nwork with all the energy at his disposal, but his thoughts were ever\nwandering to his art.\n\nAdded to his own inclinations, his grandmother, who perceived his\nextraordinary gifts, strongly persuaded him to devote his attention\nentirely to art, and consequently after some little time he decided to\nreturn to Cherbourg. Here he entered the studio of M. Langlois, an\nartist whose reputation in the town was considerable. Again in this\nworthy man he came in contact with a painter who had been brought up\nentirely under classical influence. Langlois, who had in his early\ndays been a pupil of Gros, had absorbed the classical tradition to\nsuch an extent as to be incapable of appreciating any other style. He\nappears to have endeavoured to mould Millet in his own method rather\nthan develop the latent genius which the latter possessed. The\nincompatibility of these two men speedily caused the younger to strike\nout in his own way. He saw more good in frequenting the museums and\nmaking copies of such works as appealed to him than in listening to\nthe advice of his teacher. All this occurred, however, without any\nbreach of friendship occurring. On the contrary, Langlois, after\nperceiving the futility of inducing his pupil to follow in his\nfootsteps, did all he could to advance his interests.\n\nBy means of his influence some of Millet's drawings were brought\nbefore the Municipal Council, and Langlois suggested that Millet\nshould be sent to Paris in order to further his development, and that\nthe Council should set aside a modest pension to meet his requirements\nin that city. The discussion appears to have been very prolonged, and\nupon the question being put to a vote it was only carried by means of\nthe casting vote of the mayor. Four hundred francs was at first\nallotted to him in this way, which was further increased shortly\nafterwards to six hundred. Such encouragement, meagre though it was,\nwas sufficient to give him a foothold in the metropolis. He left\nCherbourg in January 1837, on a cold and raw day, the snow falling\nheavily throughout the entire journey, and arrived in Paris in a very\ndisheartened condition. The miserable weather, coupled with the long\njourney in which he had had time to think of the small sum which lay\nbetween him and starvation, going to a city which he had never seen\nbefore, had all served to work upon his nerves, and he entered the\ngreat city sick at heart and very despondent.\n\nOne of the first visits he made after he was somewhat settled down in\nParis was to the Louvre. Here he was brought into contact for the\nfirst time with many masters, who were to mould his yet plastic\ntemperament into the form which enabled him to give to the world, in\nlater years, so many masterpieces. As I have said before, it was\nMantegna who first captivated him, and the influence of the mighty\nPaduan was never finally to be shaken off. Michel Angelo awed him with\nhis sublimity; his classical severity tempered with intense humanism,\nhis masculine strength, were bound to have their effect upon so\nserious a character as Millet. Strange as it may seem to those who are\nbut superficially acquainted with his art, and are only too apt to\njudge him by the influence he has had upon modern French painting, he\nwas fascinated with the antique. The traditions of Phidias and\nPraxiteles, in the form in which they had been transmitted through the\ngreatest minds of the Renaissance, were ever the factors which guided\nhim throughout his career. It was this same spirit which impelled his\nfervid admiration for Nicolas Poussin, a master who to-day is sadly\nunderrated and but little understood. It was the mysteries of line,\nthe wonders of pose and composition rather than the magic of colour\nwhich appealed to him. He had a profound admiration for the glowing\ncanvases of Titian and Rubens, but he could never overlook entirely\ntheir defects of drawing or, in the case of Rubens, the tendency to\nvulgarity. From his remarks in after years it would appear that he was\nbaffled with the mysticisms of Velazquez and Rembrandt; pure painting\nitself could never hold him. He needed to grasp the message which lay\nbehind it before he felt fully taken into the confidence of the\npainter; and as the minds of the Dutchman and the Spaniard ran in\nquite different channels to his own, they spoke with a language he\nnever understood. That he had a perceptive and critically independent\nmind may be gauged from his enthusiasm for Delacroix, whose work he\nencountered for the first time at the Luxembourg.\n\nDuring this period of study he was carefully considering under what\nmaster he should place himself. His choice unhappily fell upon\nDelaroche. To any one acquainted with the work of the latter master,\na more unsuitable selection could not have been made. Delaroche and\nthe painters who surrounded him can be appropriately described as\nconstituting the back-wash of the Empire style, which had reached its\nclimax with David. His subjects were always treated with academic\nreserve. No pyrotechnics were permitted; on the contrary, an\neverlasting and mistaken striving for finish was encouraged:\noriginality was sternly suppressed. To paint human life as it really\nwas, was too vulgar for any of the painters of this time. They held\nthe public taste enslaved for years. An innovator such as Millet was\ndestined to become found his position almost untenable. The band of\ncritics and painters formed a monopoly which it seemed almost\nimpossible to break down, and it was only after years of bitter and\ndetermined struggle that the school of nature finally routed its\nopponent.\n\nDelaroche doubtlessly found the peasant painter a little rude both in\nhis person and in his ideas about art. He paid but little attention to\nthe young man who had placed himself in his hands, and devoted all his\ntime to students who were more amenable to his influence. A\ntemperament so sensitive as Millet's was bound to notice this\nneglect, and consequently after a time he became so discouraged that\nhe ceased to frequent Delaroche's studio. Another very good reason for\nthis action was the lack of resources to continue his payments. Even\nduring the time he had been with Delaroche he lost no opportunity of\nturning a few honest francs by painting the portraits of any who could\nbe got to sit to him. Delaroche, however, had a more kindly heart than\nMillet imagined. He seems to have found out the real distress of the\nyoung artist, and to have assisted him pecuniarily in many ways, and\nthere is no doubt that he appreciated the talent of the young Norman\nmuch more than he cared to own. Many of his remarks on record would\nserve to show that Delaroche already felt that his pupil was destined\nto be one of the leaders of the movement which was finally to\noverthrow his own style, and doubtlessly felt a great admiration for a\nman who had the courage and strength to swim against rather than with\nthe current.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STRUGGLE FOR RECOGNITION\n\n\nFreed from all encumbrances save poverty, Millet was now to work out\nhis own destiny according to the dictates of his genius. He joined a\nfriend named Marolle, and the two together occupying a very small\napartment endeavoured to eke out an existence. It was only too soon\napparent that young as he was, and the taste of the public being not\nyet ready for development upon the lines his genius directed him, that\nhis livelihood could not be secured by endeavouring to sell such\nsubjects as appealed to him. In these straits he turned to\nportrait-painting, just as many great painters before and since him\nhave done. That the struggle was very keen can well be imagined by the\nfact that he was unable to obtain more than five to ten francs apiece;\nand, as commissions were very scarce, he was hard put to gain the\nmeans of subsistence. This state of affairs lasted until 1840, in\nwhich year he endeavoured to obtain admission to the Salon with two\nportraits, one of which was that of his friend. This, however, was\nrejected, and the other picture, although accepted, was unnoticed by\neither the critics or the public.\n\nHaving occasion the next year to pay a visit to Cherbourg, he felt\nobliged to report himself to the Municipal Council who had had the\ngenerosity to send him in the first place to Paris. Its worthy members\nexpressed themselves as but little satisfied with the result of their\ninvestment; they claimed that they had had as yet but little to show\nfor their money, and they suggested, partly as a means of\ndemonstrating that they had had some little return, and also, in order\nto see of what stuff their prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was made, that he should paint a\nportrait of the recently deceased mayor. As Millet had not been\npersonally acquainted with that worthy citizen, and as the only guide\nwhich could be supplied him was a portrait made in miniature when he\nwas a young man of some twenty-three or twenty-four years of age, the\ntask was by no means easy. However, the artist set to work with a\nwill, and finally accomplished the picture to his own satisfaction.\n\nUpon it being shown to the Council, one and all declared, as any one\nwith the slightest knowledge of such matters could have told them\nbefore it was commenced, that it bore not the least resemblance to the\ndefunct magistrate. They therefore demurred at the three hundred\nfrancs they had agreed to pay him for the portrait, and offered him\none-third of that amount instead. Millet was deeply offended by the\ninsult, and informed the Council that he made them a present of the\npicture.\n\nIt was during this short visit to his native country that he met his\nfirst wife, a Mlle. Ono, whose portrait he had painted. From the first\nshe was very delicate, and he lost her after much suffering, three\nyears later. His second wife was Mlle. Catherine Lemaire, who was\ndestined to be the companion of his struggles until the end of his\nlife.\n\nMeanwhile Millet was occupied with subjects which he thought would\nappeal to the general public. A number of classical pictures date from\nthis epoch. It was an endeavour on his part to fall in as far as\npossible with the current taste, and so supply means of subsistence\nfor his family. At the same time he did not neglect his favourite\nsubjects, and many are the wonderful studies of peasant life which\ndate from these years. His reputation had so far advanced that he was\noffered the position of teacher of drawing in the college at\nCherbourg. It must have been only after prolonged deliberation that he\nrefused the proffered post. Here a certain annual stipend was assured\nhim, and if it was not large in itself it would at any rate suffice to\nkeep the wolf from the door. He preferred, however, to return to Paris\nand work out his own destiny as best he might.\n\nMillet, who lived at this time in the Rue Rochechouart, began to\nsurround himself with that little group of friends who remained\nfaithful to him until the end of his career. Amongst the earliest were\nCharles Jacque and Diaz: the latter had several clients amongst the\nsmall dealers, whom he induced to visit Millet's studio and make now\nand again a small purchase.\n\nMillet now became a fairly regular contributor to the Salon, but\ngenerally sent some classical or religious picture as well as one of\nhis peasant subjects. For example, in 1848 he sent the marvellous\nstudy of \"The Winnower,\" which we all know so well, accompanied by a\ncanvas, \"The Captivity of the Jews at Babylon.\" The latter, however,\nwas so badly received that he utilised the canvas upon its return for\na large picture of a \"Shepherdess tending her Sheep.\"\n\nIn spite of the headway that he was making, the struggle for existence\nseemed keener than ever, and but for the kindness of friends he and\nhis family would frequently have actually wanted for food. A timely\nadvance of one hundred francs obtained for him from the Minister of\nFine Arts, together with a commission from the State, for which he was\npaid the sum of eighteen hundred francs, were for some time the only\nrelief he obtained from his embarrassments. That he was not particular\nas to how he earned his daily bread is apparent from the fact that he\ndid not despise an order for a shop sign for a midwife, for which he\nwas paid the miserable amount of thirty francs.\n\nThe year 1848 was not an encouraging one for a painter who was\nstanding on the threshold of his career. The whole of Europe was\nseething with revolution. A repetition of the fearful year of 1792 was\neverywhere expected. The struggle betwixt reaction and property on the\none hand, and lawlessness and revolution on the other, was being waged\nwith grim determination. The issue was for long in the balance. One\nnever knew from one day to another what was going to happen. In such a\ndeplorable state of affairs men's minds were running on politics and\nwars rather than upon art. Millet amongst the rest was called upon to\nshoulder the musket, and it can be easily imagined with what\nreluctance he did so.\n\nParis, the great centre of art, had yet not afforded him much\nencouragement. Life was dear in the big city, and surrounded on all\nsides by bricks and mortar he was not free to go out into the fields\nand study the objects which were uppermost in his mind. He resolved to\nescape from it, and once having put the plan into execution he never\nreturned.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET IN HIS MATURITY\n\n\nThe Barbizon of 1850 was a very different place from the Barbizon of\nto-day. The world fame of the men who passed a quiet and strenuous\nexistence in the little village has transformed it into a tourist\nresort, with restaurants and caf\u00e9s, the stopping-places for\nwaggonettes which in summer bring their daily load of sightseers,\neager to see the homes of the painters whose names are now household\nwords.\n\nIt would have been well-nigh impossible for the little band to have\nchosen a more suitable spot for their labours. Rousseau and Millet,\nmuch as they were drawn towards each other by the tie of a sympathetic\ndisposition and by their common interest in art, yet were widely\ndissimilar from one another in their outlook upon art and their\nmethods of worship at the common shrine. Rousseau--one can see it from\nevery picture he painted--loved with all the yearning of a passionate\nand restless temperament the inanimate in Nature. Observe with what\nfidelity he draws his trees, with what caressing tenderness his clouds\nand skies are treated; solitude appealed to him above all things, and\nif here and there he was obliged to insert a few figures to complete\nhis composition, one instinctively feels that he would rather have\nsubstituted a group of cattle or a flock of sheep. In the glades of\nthe forest, far from the busy haunts of men, with the glorious\nsunlight penetrating from above, the breeze moaning through the\nbranches, he was happy. A wild and turbulent temperament such as his\nnot infrequently discovers exquisite enjoyment amidst such perfect\ntranquillity.\n\nBarbizon, situated on the fringe of the great forest of Fontainebleau,\ntherefore, permitted Rousseau to come into daily contact with the\nscenes which so appealed to him.\n\nMillet, on the other hand, was absorbed in the peasant. The man who\ntilled the soil and raised the produce humanity requires for its\nsubsistence by the sweat of his brow; the manifold duties of the\nlabourer, his life and sorrows, appealed to him with irresistible\nforce. An unpeopled track of wild and uncultivated land would not call\nforth any emotion in him, no matter how sublime the scenery might be.\n\nThe life of the village, spreading itself into the vast and fertile\nplain behind, held him absorbed; a peasant himself and living amongst\nthe people he so loved, he was in a position to bring before an\nunthinking world the poignant monotony of their useful lives.\n\nUpon their first arrival at Barbizon, the two artists put up at a\nsmall inn, working all day in a tiny place they had rented from some\npeasants and fitted up as a studio. The inconveniences of this\narrangement were soon apparent, and shortly afterwards Millet took a\nsmall house which was destined to be his abode for the remainder of\nhis life; an old barn in the immediate vicinity meanwhile provided him\nwith an excellent studio.\n\nFrom this period onward we must date the greatest productions of the\nmaster, the works which have induced more thought than those of any\nother peasant painter. A peasant among peasants, his life was of the\nmost rigid simplicity. Behind his little abode a large garden\nstretched away almost to the fringe of the forest itself, and here he\nwas accustomed to work every morning, growing a portion of the food\nnecessary to the sustenance of his family. The afternoon he devoted to\npainting, whilst the evening was given over to intercourse with his\nlittle circle of friends. The simplicity and tranquillity of his life\naroused the whole of his powers to action, and surrounded with\neverything he valued in life he was supremely happy.\n\nThe country around Barbizon appealed to him irresistibly. The\ntimber-studded plains, the gently undulating, highly cultivated\nfields, presented a strange contrast to the wild and rugged country\namidst which he had spent his childhood, and no doubt conduced to the\ndevelopment of a more refined and contemplative style than he would\notherwise have acquired. Upon his few visits to his native country he\nappears to have been more impressed than ever with its austerity, and\nthe drawings which these journeys called forth bore ample evidence of\nthis feeling in him.\n\nLack of the necessary funds to carry on even his simple m\u00e9nage was\never the bane of Millet's life. On many occasions Sensier, his\nintimate friend and afterwards his biographer, informs us he dissuaded\nhim from suicide.\n\nThe sums that he owed, small though they were, rendered him in\nconstant fear of the brokers. With creditors so importunate in their\ndemands for satisfaction, and with the constant lack of recognition,\nwhich was his lot, it is astonishing that Millet achieved so much. He\nwas relieved more than once by the kind-hearted and ever faithful\nRousseau, who when his friend was sorest pressed found some delicately\nhidden means to relieve him. It was he who acquired for 4000 francs\nthe wonderful \"Peasant grafting a Tree,\" when the picture failed to\nfind a purchaser; and in order that Millet should not be aware of his\ngenerosity, he made the offer in the name of an imaginary American.\n\nThis sort of goodness he repeated more than once, and it redounds\nstill more to his credit when we remember that Rousseau himself was\nnot infrequently in pecuniary difficulties.\n\nA constant succession of important works made their appearance during\nthe first ten years Millet spent at Barbizon. The first was the\nwell-known \"Sower,\" which has ever been one of the most popular of his\npictures. Then came the far finer \"Peasants going to Work,\" which for\nmany years was in an English Collection. The \"Gleaners,\" perhaps the\nnoblest canvas the master ever painted, dates from 1857, in which year\nit was seen at the Salon; the celebrated \"Angelus\" followed it two\nyears later. The prices which Millet obtained for this series of\nremarkable works was fantastically small. The \"Gleaners\" brought him a\npaltry 2000 francs, whilst he accounted himself lucky to encounter an\namateur who gave him the same sum for the small \"Woman feeding Fowls.\"\n\nThe \"Angelus,\" which was never exhibited, was sold in the year it was\npainted to a Monsieur Feydeau, an architect, for 1800 francs. It then\npassed through several hands before the late Monsieur Secr\u00e9tan\ncompeted up to 160,000 francs before he became possessed of the prize\nat the John Wilson sale.\n\nThe purchase, however, proved a sound investment, for upon the\ndispersal of his collection it was knocked down for 553,000 francs to\na Monsieur Proust, acting on behalf of the French Government. The\nlatter, however, when they gave the commission to buy the picture, had\nno idea that such a high value would be placed upon it, and\nconsequently refused to ratify the sale; a syndicate now came upon the\nscene, who took it to America. The price, however, proved greater than\neven the millionaires of the States were prepared to give, and the\ncanvas again returned to France, where it found a resting-place in the\ncollection of Monsieur Chauchard, who paid the enormous sum of 800,000\nfrancs for its possession.\n\nIn 1859 Millet sent two works to the Salon, a \"Woman grazing her Cow,\"\nand \"Death and the Woodman.\" The latter, one of the most\nphilosophical of Millet's pictures, which to-day is the principal\nattraction of the Jacobsen Museum at Copenhagen, was rejected.\n\nDisappointments of this kind came with such systematic regularity to\nthe painter that he must have become proof against them. He always had\nbitter enemies amongst the critics, who never failed to pour abuse\nupon his method and his subjects. Even a number of his fellow artists\njoined in the chorus of disapproval. But the vehemence with which he\nwas attacked was striking evidence of the impression he was making and\nthe inward sense of his own powers; and the fact that he was working\nout his destiny according to the dictates of his own genius supported\nhim against this outpouring of prejudice and malice. The social side\nof life appealed to him more strongly as the years rolled on, and the\nmurmurings which had been heard in 1859 as to the socialistic\ntendencies of \"Death and the Woodman\" swelled to a roar when the\nstupendous \"Man with the Hoe\" was exhibited fourteen years later. The\nlatter, one of the most virile studies of depraved humanity which the\nworld has ever seen, has always been a favourite with social\nreformers, and has inspired one remarkable poem. Even his most\nimplacable critics were disarmed before this canvas; its power was\nmagnetic; it was an inspiration, soul moving and trenchant.\n\nHis financial difficulties never completely dispersed. At one time, in\norder to insure himself a little tranquillity, he made a contract with\ntwo speculators, whereby they were to become possessors of all the\nwork he produced for three years, in consideration of their assuring\nhim a thousand francs a month. A great number of Millet's finest\nproductions passed thus through their hands, including the \"Return\nfrom the Fields\" and the \"Man with the Hoe.\" The partners were not\nlong in quarrelling, and after a lawsuit had been fought, Millet was\nleft in the hands of a man who frequently would not or could not pay\nhim in ready money, and whose bills he was frequently forced to\ndiscount at considerable loss.\n\nOne little gleam of sunshine rendered his later days happy. This was a\ncommission from a Colmar banker, Monsieur Thomas by name, who required\nfour allegorical compositions representing the Seasons, to decorate\nhis rooms. The artist was overjoyed by this piece of good fortune,\nand immediately commenced a most conscientious study of such mural\ndecoration as was within reach, in order that he might do full justice\nto his patron. He paid frequent visits to Fontainebleau and the\nLouvre, and even desired a friend to inquire if he could not obtain\nreproductions of the frescoes at Herculaneum and Pompeii. In spite of\nall this elaborate preparation, the subjects were not such as appealed\nto his genius, and in spite of them being well and soundly painted, we\nare told that they presented no features which called for special\ncomment.\n\nHe found, however, a much more genial occupation in accomplishing a\nseries of drawings ordered by a Monsieur Gavet, who paid the artist\n1000, 700, and 450 francs each, according to their size. He made\naltogether ninety-five drawings in this way, and it is said that this\ngentleman had in his possession the finest work in black and white and\nwater-colour the artist ever executed.\n\nTowards the latter end of his life the death of dear relatives and\nfriends cast a sorrowful gloom over him. Amongst the latter Rousseau,\nwho expired in his presence on the 22nd of December 1867, was\nperhaps the loss which seemed to him hardest to bear. A staunch and\ntrusty friend, who was to be relied upon when his prospects seemed the\nmost hopeless, he had been one of the very few who had appreciated\nMillet's talents at their full worth, and who, moreover, scanty as his\nown means were, was ever ready to stretch out his hand to assist his\nstruggling friend.\n\nShortly afterwards Millet paid a visit to his patron, Herr Hartmann,\nat M\u00fcnster, and from here he went for a short time into Switzerland.\n\nUpon his return he devoted himself with great earnestness to work, and\nachieved a certain success at the Salons with his exhibits. The\noutbreak of the war with Germany caused him to migrate with his family\nto Cherbourg, where he thought he might continue to work, removed as\nfar as possible from the scenes of carnage and struggle which were\ngoing on farther east. Transported once more amongst the scenes of his\nchildhood, he felt an increased impetus to production, and when he\nreturned to Barbizon late in 1871, he brought with him a number of\ncanvases of the highest quality; conspicuous amongst them was the\nwonderful \"Gr\u00e9ville Church,\" now in the Louvre.\n\nThe anxieties of his troublous life were, however, beginning to show\ntheir effect upon his constitution; a persistent cough developed, and\nalthough an amelioration would occasionally occur, it was always\nsucceeded by a worse condition than before. His health suffered a\ngeneral decline, and he finally breathed his last on the 20th of\nJanuary 1875. He was buried in the little cemetery of Chailly, beside\nhis friend Rousseau, amidst the scenery they both loved so well.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE MAN AND HIS ART\n\n\nMillet is an instance of an artist working out his own destiny,\nimpelled by irresistible genius, in the teeth of seemingly\ninsurmountable obstacles. He started life with enormous disadvantages;\nwithout friends in influential circles to spread his fame or plead his\ncause; without money to enable him to outlive and triumph over the\nignorant fanaticism of critics and artists, so soaked in the\nconventionalised art of their time that they had not perception enough\nto appreciate the full meaning of that naturalistic movement, which\nwas finally to sweep away the quasi-classic art they boasted of with\nsuch bombastic effusion. The path was hard and thorny, and his triumph\nwas not finally consummated until after his death. He himself found\nhis only satisfaction in the fact that he had lived his life according\nto the dictates of his genius, and had achieved the maximum of which\nhe was capable.\n\nMillet and our own Cotman were somewhat kindred spirits; there is much\nmore affinity between the work of the two men than is apparent to any\none who has not closely studied them. The marvellous \"Breaking the\nClod,\" now happily permanently housed at the British Museum, betrays\nthe same tremendous conception and broad outlook which characterises\nmany a drawing of Millet's. Both highly strung to a painful extent,\nthey were each conscious of their inability to curb the power which\nprescribed a certain course for them, and in spite of pecuniary\ndifficulties and unpopularity, an inevitable result of their intense\noriginality, they pursued a steady course to the end of their lives.\n\nThe socialistic doctrines which have been read into the work of Millet\nare rather the outcome of the world's uneasy conscience being brought\nface to face with a crushing indictment of existing conditions, than\nof any design on the artist's part to further the cause of a political\npropaganda by means of his art. This somewhat extravagant reading into\nhis art has certainly been carried to excess. Particularly has such\nbeen the case in America, where a large number of his finest works are\nat present to be found, curiously enough in the hands of enormously\nwealthy people, who are frequently perhaps the least able to\nunderstand the real meaning of his message.\n\nComing from a peasant stock, his sympathies were always with the\npeasant; it was the only class he understood or cared for. He lived as\none of them, and shared to a large extent in their labour. He has been\ndesignated, not inappropriately, the philosopher in sabots. Rightly or\nwrongly he has come to be looked upon as one of the high priests of\ncommunistic doctrines. Few pictures have been so anathematised as the\n\"Man with the Hoe,\" and perhaps none have done more to inculcate\nsympathy with the degradation of the lower orders of the human race.\n\nThe revolting brutality and vacancy of that face haunts the\nimagination. Is it possible that fellow-creatures so utterly debased\nby toil and neglect exist? Millet dispels any doubt upon the question\nby bequeathing to humanity this trenchant portrait. By no means\nlimited to Barbizon or France, these poor creatures exist in every\ncountry, and curiously enough are considered an essential element in\neach country's development.\n\nThis poignantly human note is observable in almost every work Millet\nwrought; his passionate sympathy with his fellow-man is the keynote of\nhis art. The wood-cutter in his arduous toil, the shepherd in his\nsolitariness, the labourer turning the soil with unvarying and\nlaborious monotony, the mother caring for her children--all carry the\nsame message for him of that strange and incomprehensible mingling of\njoy and sadness we call life. Like many great minds before and since\nhis time, our artist found the greatest joy in life in a placid and\nnever changing melancholy. But the peasants he chose knew nothing of\nthe sadness he saw in them. Completely inured to their toil, and\nsubdued by it, with no refining or uplifting influence to stimulate\nthem, they knew nothing, aspired to nothing beyond what they were; it\nwas left to Millet to supply the \"might have been.\" He saw the inky\nblackness of the mind of the \"Man with the Hoe,\" the pathetic\ninequality between the mounted farmer directing the safe storage of\nhis crop, and the stooping figures of the \"Gleaners\" eager to scrape\nup the miserable crumbs which had fallen from the rich man's table. He\ntraced the lives of these simple folk until we arrive at the grim and\ngaunt figure of Death, who, as he grasps the woodman by the shoulder,\nreminds him that his course is finished and that he, in common with\nall his fellow-men, must enter the great unknown land from which there\nis no return. It is a sad and melancholy art, vibrating with purity\nand truth, the outpouring of a great soul yearning to express itself\nto the utmost of its power. The mind and character of the man can be\nread in every line and in every touch of the brush. His drawings and\netchings are even more searching in their virility than his pictures.\n\nThere is a spontaneousness about them we search for in vain in his\nwork in oil and pastel. In black and white his intensely emotional\nmind found a swift method of expression; in the laboriousness of oil\npainting he was fettered with the complications of the medium. It can\nbe fairly said that only in one or two paintings--a notable example\ncan be cited in the wondrous \"Sawyers\" at South Kensington--does he\nrise to the height of a great painter. Millet was a poet, a\nphilosopher, a great thinker, and the means he chose for expressing\nhimself were those which were best fitted to his purpose. His\npredilections in art were concentrated upon the greatest, and\nconsequently the men who appealed to him were the thinkers of the\nages. Mantegna and Correggio, Michel Angelo and the mighty Greeks,\nthese were the masters who left their impress upon his mind and art.\n\nThe influence of so sincere and profound an artist has necessarily\nbeen profound. He has moulded men who have achieved world-wide fame;\nSegantini, for example, would never have risen to the heights he did\nhad the example of Millet not been ever before him. There have been\nmany who, without possessing his genius, have endeavoured to follow\nin his footsteps, but successfully as his imitators have sometimes\ncaught his style, their productions can never live alongside his,\nbecause they lack the real ring of sincerity.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n        a. One bed, or folding cot,\n        b. One oil stove,\n        c. One lamp,\n        d. Enough supplies of all kinds sufficient for six months,\n        e. Pots, pans, kettles, etc.\nIt is needless to say that positions in Manila and Iloilo were now at\na premium.\n\nWas it possible that teachers were to be sent to places where even the\nnecessaries of life could not be obtained! Was it possible that many\nwould be sent to places so remote that for six months no fresh\nsupplies could be gotten! A mass meeting was held at once, and a\ncommittee was appointed to send a cablegram to the Associated Press\npetitioning aid from the American people at large. Realizing what\nconsternation would be created throughout the United States by such a\nmessage, two of the teachers leaped into a carriage at the close of\nthe meeting and a few moments later were closeted with the chief\nexecutive of the department. As a result the committee was persuaded\nnot to send the cablegram to the Associated Press until by courtesy it\nhad been sent to the President. Of course, this diplomatic move tided\naffairs over and the teachers who had flatly refused to budge from\nManila now agreed to go on to their stations, being assured that\nwhatever action was best would be taken.\n\nThe day had come when we must separate. We were to enter an untried\nand an unknown field. It was fitting that we have a final joyous\nmeeting, so the best orchestra in the archipelago was engaged and we\n\"chased the hours with flying feet\" until dawn so that whatever might\ncome to us in that unknown future upon which we were entering each\nwould hold in pleasant memory our last evening together.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER III. - A DRAMA IN ACTUAL LIFE.\n\n\nAlmost every one heeded the warning to go to his station forearmed\nwith at least necessaries of life, but, as it had never fallen to the\nlot of the writer to cook, he refused to learn at that late day, so he\ntook no pot, no pan, no kettle, putting his future into the hands of\nan uncertain fate and relying upon the unknown hospitality of the\nFilipino.\n\nBacalod, the capital of the province of Occidental Negros, was our\ndestination. The second morning after leaving Manila, we awoke with\nthe \"Kilpatrick\" lying at anchor in a shallow bay. We were several\nmiles from the shore and nothing in sight indicated that we had\nreached a place of any importance. Late the night before we had been\nawakened by the loud, sharp ringing of the ship's bells, accompanied\nby the reversal of the engines and a general disturbance awaking the\ncrew. So our first impressions on coming on deck were that we had run\naground. But the captain assured us that everything was ship-shape and\nthat this was the nearest point of approach to Capiz, a town of\nconsiderable importance on the island of Panay, where a body of troops\nwas to embark for home. Not even the grass hut of a native was in\nsight. Search as we would, not a sign was seen of a stream flowing\ninto the sea, indicating the probable presence of a town. There was\nnot a sign of life of any kind save one lone column of thin, blue\nsmoke that arose from the side of a mountain miles away. One would\nhave thought that we were explorers of three hundred years ago lying\noff the shore of some unknown land.\n\nAfter breakfast the steam launch, together with all the boats, was\nlowered, and several of us who had determined to miss no opportunity\nto gather information about the islands took our places in the launch\nby the side of the ship's mate, and steamed away across the water with\na long line of boats strung out in the rear. We headed away toward a\ngroup of cocoanut trees, and about an hour later stepped ashore on a\npile of decayed coral rocks that extended some twenty or thirty feet\nout into the water, thus forming the only landing place of a town of\nseveral thousands of people and of considerable commercial importance.\n\nA few moments after we had landed, an army wagon drawn by a\nmagnificent pair of mules came up out of a tropical jungle along a\nnarrow road. We clambered into the wagon and were soon lost in the\ndepths of foliage from which we had just seen the vehicle emerge.\n\nLong waving bamboos with their plumy leafage hung over the road from\neach side, meeting and overlapping in the center until they formed an\narchway so dense that the tropical sun now high in the heavens\npenetrated it only at intervals. At times the wagon sank up to the\nhubs in the soft earth, and the muscles of the mules stood out like\nwhip-cords under the skin as they drew us forward.\n\nAt a sharp turn in the road we came upon the first division of troops\nthat was to embark for home. The look of joy upon their sun-browned\nfaces was inexpressible. Their work was done, and with elastic step\nand smiling faces they saluted us as they passed by. The reign of\nforce was at an end; it was going out with them; the reign of peace\nhad begun; it was coming in with us.\n\nIn the afternoon when we returned from the town the last of the troops\nhad arrived and, as we drove up, the bugle was sounding the call to\nsupper. We noticed native women mingling with the troops and, indeed,\na native woman was in constant attention waiting upon one of the\nsoldiers with whom we ate. Her clothes were clean, her hair was nicely\ncombed, and her general appearance was neat. She seemed to anticipate\nthe slightest wish of the soldier with whom she was. She brought him\nwater to drink, cleaned his plate after the meal and saw that his\nknife, fork, and spoon were put into his haversack.\n\nWe had now finished supper and the launch had returned for the last\nload of troops. The lieutenant in command of the company gave the\norder to \"fall in\"; the men shouldered their rifles and fell into\nline. \"Forward, march!\" called the lieutenant, and the column swept\nforward towards the boats. The women had until now restrained\nthemselves, but, as their husbands marched away never to return, their\nfeelings could no longer be restrained. One young woman of about\neighteen, who was leaning against a rock by the roadside sobbing, when\nher husband passed, leaped up in frenzy of passionate love and caught\nthe rifle from his shoulder. Her first impulse seemed to be to throw\nthe gun away, but suddenly realizing the futility of such an act she\nburst into tears, shouldered the rifle herself and marched on by his\nside. Another woman of more mature age threw her arms around the legs\nof a tall stalwart man, and drew him bodily from the line.\n\nBut the troops marched on and entered the boats. One woman who had\nbeen unnoticed before came down into the shallow water and caught hold\nof our last boat as if to prevent its leaving, while others stood\nmingling their sobs with the sounds of the wavelets as they broke on\nthe sands. As we passed away, an expectant mother, standing in bold\noutline against the twilight sky, threw up her hands in an agony of\ndespair and then sank upon the stones. The curtain had fallen upon a\ndrama in actual life deeper in pathos than any other we had ever seen\nor ever expected to see. Depth of passion, depth of love! Who can\nfathom the human heart?\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. - WHAT THE TEACHERS DID.\n\n\nThere is a remarkable sameness about the towns in the Philippines.\n\nThey all have a large open square about the middle of the town, around\nthree sides of which are Chinese stores, unless one side lies open to\nthe sea, and on the fourth is the great stone ecclesia. The streets\nrun at right angles to one another and divide up the town into\ncreditable squares.\n\nEverybody in the Philippines lives up-stairs, for the ground is so\nsoaked with water during the rainy season that it is a menace to\nhealth to live upon the ground floor. So even the poorest nippa hut\nis built upon stakes four or five feet above the ground.\n\nBacalod is a typical Philippine town. As we landed, a broad open\nsquare was spread out before us. Two sides of the square were lined\nwith two-story houses in which were Chinese stores below and Filipino\nhomes above. On the third side stood the great stone church in whose\nmassive tower the clock was striking the hour of four, while the\nfourth lay open to the sea that had borne us thither.\n\nWe landed, but it was in a method new to us and one not usually\nemployed by the traveling public.\n\nWhen our sail boat ran aground on the sandy bottom a hundred yards or\nmore from the shore, a crowd of Filipino men who were on the beach\nslowly rolled up their pantaloons and waded out to the rescue,--for\nthe money that was in it. The boat's crew elevated their trousers'\nlegs also and slided down into the water. Each of us then straddled\nthe neck of a Filipino standing in the water and was held by ankles to\nbe steadied while our biped mounts proceeded to the shore.\n\nWe were now on the ground and face to face with the situation. To give\nthe reader an idea of the actual conditions met by the first teachers\nwho went to the Islands, the following is copied from the instructions\ngiven us in Manila:\n    1. There shall be two sessions daily of all schools, and the\n    last hour of the morning session shall be devoted solely to\n    instructing the Filipino teachers.\n\n    2. In cases where teachers are sent to a town in which there\n    is no school-house, they are expected to secure the aid of the\n    people and have one built.\n\n    3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is\n    stopped.\n\n    4. All supplies must be kept under lock and key. In towns\n    where there is no case or box to lock the supplies in, and it\n    is also impossible to get the town council to furnish a case,\n    a requisition may be sent to Manila, and, if an appropriation\n    can be secured, one will be made and sent out.\n\nThus it can be easily seen that we were indeed pioneers. In many\nplaces no school-house was to be found, and in some cases it was even\ndifficult to get the town council to provide a case in which to keep\nthe supplies.\n\nThe work of the teachers was, in short; to \"make the English language\nthe basis of instruction in the public schools.\" On our arrival at\nBacalod two schools were found in progress, for some soldiers had been\ndetailed for the work here previous to our coming. One of these was\nfor boys and the other, for girls. Thus the work here had been in a\nmeasure simplified, but complications that had arisen at Talisay, one\nof the largest and richest towns on the island, demanded a change of\nteachers and the writer was assigned to the place as superintendent.\n\nHere an attempt had been made to start a school but it had failed\nignominiously and a system of education was to be put into operation\nfrom the very start.\n\nThe Filipinos are not strong advocates of co-education, so separate\nschools were to be started for the boys and the girls. The one for the\nboys was gotten well in hand before the one for the girls was\nattempted at all.\n\nA few days after reaching the town and securing a home the\npresidente of the town had it publicly announced that the following\nMonday morning at eight o'clock a public school for boys would be\nopened in a building that had been rented for the purpose by the\nmunicipal council. About the middle of the afternoon of the same day a\nman beat a little drum throughout all the streets of the town to call\nthe people out and the town clerk announced both in Spanish and in the\nnative language that this public school would begin at the time and\nplace mentioned above; that instruction would be free to all who came;\nthat the government would furnish all supplies; and that instruction\nwould be given in the English language. A native principal and\nassistants were employed and everything was ready to begin.\n\nThe official report of the result is as follows:\n    Boys' public school of Talisay, Negros, P. I., began November\n    4, 1901. Forty-three boys present at eight o'clock. Forty-one\n    of them knew \"good morning\" and \"good afternoon\" but do not\n    know the distinction between them. Two of them speak simple\n    Spanish. At eight forty-five, eight more, who had been\n    attending an early morning private school, came in together.\n\n    The books they brought were so varied and so different from\n    one another that it seemed impossible to bring any reasonable\n    degree of order out of such a chaos, and so, after struggling\n    vainly for about a week with the problem, the superintendent\n    by one fell stroke removed everything in use and put in a\n    uniform system, and from that day on the English language has\n    been the basis of instruction in the public schools of\n    Talisay. The work was of necessity very slow at first, but by\n    the end of a year two schools were going nicely and a number\n    of the brightest boys and girls had made really excellent\n    progress.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER V. - A \"BAILE.\"\n\n\nNot long after the arrival of our party at Bacalod we received an\ninvitation to a \"baile\" given in our honor by the inhabitants of\nSilay, a town some ten or twelve miles up the northern coast and one\nnoted for its social life. The invitation was accepted with pleasure,\nand about the middle of the afternoon on the day appointed we were\nclad in the immaculate white of the tropics and steaming away up the\ncoast on board a launch sent for our conveyance. Twilight was still\nlingering on the path of day when we anchored just off shore at the\ntown. A row-boat containing the officials of the city came out to meet\nus and, in due season, we were ushered into a spacious drawing-room\nfilled almost to overflowing with the \u00e9lite of the town. The \u00e9lite of\ntowns in the Philippines speak Spanish, and, as only one or two of our\nparty could at that time boast of more than a formal acquaintance with\nthe Castilian tongue, the exchange of ideas that evening between us\nand the Filipinos was of necessity not very rapid.\n\nThe necessity of easy communication between us was rendered somewhat\nless indispensable by the announcement of supper as soon as we were\nrested from our trip. When we had taken our places at the table a\nyoung Filipino about twenty-five years of age arose and gave a lengthy\ntoast to the recent union of the Philippines with the United States.\n\nBut as we Americans were unable to scale the dizzy heights of his\nclimaxes or sink to the depths of his pathos, we forewent the\npleasures of his oratory and turned our attention to the savory odor\nof lamb, chicken, and roast pig that came slyly stealing up our\nnostrils to send us nerve dispatches about the gastronomic delights of\nour not far distant future.\n\nAt last the toast was ended and the world-wide soup ushered in a long\ntrain of things good to eat, served in a style better fitted to the\ndelights of the appetite than to the formalities of dinners, for, as\nsoon as the pleasant task of one dish was completed by any one, the\nnext was served him at once regardless of the progress made by the\nothers at the table.\n\nThe last course was dulce. The new-comers to the Philippines will\nnot be long in making the acquaintance of this dish, and at all\nmeetings, both public and private, where eatables are served, it\nperforms an important part. It is anything sweet, and it may vary all\nthe way from an india-rubber-like black mixture of cocoanut milk and\ndirty sugar to a really toothsome and respectable confection. No\nmatter of what materials a dish is composed, just so long as it is\nsweet, it is dulce.\n\nAfter paying our respects to this last course, we arose from the table\nand entered a great rectangular room from the center of whose ceiling\nhung a large glass chandelier, a mass of shimmering crystals. In the\nchairs around the room were the wealth, the youth, and the beauty of\nthe town.\n\nThe first and also the last number of every Filipino dance of any\nformality is the \"rigodon.\" The dancers are arranged in a square, or\nquadrangle according to the number participating, and are then led\nthrough a tangled maze of figures that so utterly bewilders the novice\nthat he sinks into his chair at the end of the dance wondering how it\nall came to pass.\n\nWe Americans breathed a sigh of relief when the \"rigodon\" ended, and\nmustered fresh courage for social conquests in the waltz that was now\nbreathing forth from the trembling strings. My companion in the first\ndance had been the young lady by whose side I had sat at dinner. But\nit now became necessary to search for another, so I prudently waited\nto see how partners were chosen, and made no mistake when a few\nmoments later I faced one of the most luscious looking se\u00f1oritas on\nthe opposite side of the room and offered her my arm. My eyes must\nhave told the story that my lips could not utter in Spanish, for she\nsmiled upon me sweetly, arose, and put her hand upon my shoulder. My\narm encircled her waist and I began to waltz. Unfortunately my\ncompanion did not follow, but began to hop up and down in a manner\nmost distressing. Supposing the attack to be only temporary, I paused\nand, much to my relief, she soon showed signs of recovery; and in the\ncourse of time she came to a standstill looking up into my face in an\ninquiring sort of way, apparently wondering why St. Vitus had not paid\nhis respects to me also. A second attempt to follow the music met with\nresults similar to the first, and during the third attempt, which\nseemed to be trembling on the verge of a failure, St. Vitus let go my\ncompanion and seized me with such vigor that she, who was small even\nfor a Filipino, was gathered up bodily and taken around the room at\nsuch a pace that her toes touched the floor only at far distant\nintervals.\n\nAt this point my devotion to the shrine of Terpsichore ceased from\nforce of circumstances and I seated myself in one of the most\ncomfortable chairs in sight that I might carry out a previously formed\nplan to study the Filipino somewhat critically as he appears in\nsociety.\n\nThe first thing that impressed me as the dancers passed up and down\nthe room was the flash of diamonds. Nearly every woman in the room had\non a brooch that flashed the colors of the rainbow at every turn.\n\nAlmost all of them wore one or more rings that showed up brilliantly\nunder the chandelier. Many of the men too, especially the young men,\nwore gems that appeared to be exquisite. A closer inspection showed\nthat some of the gems had flaws and others were of a poor color, but\nno one would have denied that, taken as a whole, it was a really\nbeautiful display.\n\nThe dress of the ladies was richly colored. Many of their skirts were\nof silk covered with hand embroidered flowers, and their filmy pina\nwaists and broad collar pieces were rich with needle-work. They all\nwore a kind of heelless velvet slipper, very common as a dress shoe in\nthe Philippines, or high-heeled patent leather shoes with neatly\nfitting black stockings.\n\nThe men were dressed in white coats and white pantaloons or black\ncoats and white pantaloons. White shirts and collars, together with\nall sorts and styles of cravats and low-cut patent leather shoes with\nhighly colored socks completed their dress.\n\nIt was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money;\nthat they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a\ntable loaded with good things was a fact to which all of us were\nenthusiastic witnesses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VI. - A SKETCH OF LIFE IN THE PHILIPPINES.\n\n\nHouse-keeping in the Philippines presents some interesting phases. Our\nclub of American officials decided to run a mess, so we employed a\ncook and a house boy, then each of us provided himself with a personal\nservant, making a total of six servants for four men--it takes about\nthis proportion of servants to live in any sort of comfort in the\nPhilippines--and launched ourselves boldly upon the sea of domestic\neconomy. But there were shoals ahead of us, for the question of\nregulating servants is one of no small importance in the Philippines,\nand one of its most disadvantageous features is the long chain of\ndependents that usually attends it.\n\nWe gave the cooks so much a day with which to buy supplies in the\nlocal market, for our own table, making him render a daily list of\nexpenditures, and a fixed amount besides to purchase rice and fish for\nhimself and the other servants. Of course, if they wished to vary\ntheir diet and get chicken and fresh pork, which could be had at far\ndistant intervals, it was wholly a matter of their option, but the\nallowance was made on the basis of so much rice and fish a day for\neach. This allowance was about fifteen cents a day in Spanish coin per\nservant.\n\nThus far all was well. We had agreed to give the cook eight dollars a\nmonth in Spanish money, thinking that good wages would procure good\nservice, but the visions of affluence that floated before him on such\nfloods of wealth were so alluring that they drew him from the kitchen\nto the cooler veranda. In less than a week he had employed an\nassistant at four dollars a month; in less than another week that\nassistant had employed him an assistant at two dollars a month; in\nless than another week that assistant to the assistant had employed\nhim an assistant at the princely salary of fifty cents a month; and\nfrom fear that the chain of dependents would end only by our having\nthe whole Filipino race attached to our culinary force, we broke up\nhouse-keeping and went boarding again, choosing that as the less of\nthe two evils.\n\nOur house furnishings were almost wholly Philippine. The table ware\nand the food on the table came from the ends of the earth. The knives\nand forks were made in Germany, the plates were manufactured in\nEngland, the glass ware and table cloth, in the United States. The\noatmeal and flour came from the United States also. The butter came\nfrom Australia, the rice from China, the salt from Russia, and the\nother eatables from sources about as various as their separate names.\n\nSwitzerland furnished the condensed milk and Illinois the canned\ncream. Nearly all of the canned fruit bore labels from Spain.\n\nThus it can easily be seen that life in the Philippines, if lived\naccording to American ideals, is dependent upon a highly developed and\nhighly complex commerce. However, the difficulties of transportation\nand the restriction of large stocks of merchandise to Manila and some\nhalf a dozen other towns, make so great a difference between country\nlife and city life that a short comparison of the two will not be out\nof place, and life in Manila may well be taken as being fairly typical\nof the latter.\n\nLife in Manila is pleasant, but expensive. It is pleasant from the\nfact that it is not only the capital but also metropolis of the\narchipelago. Thus the combination of wealth and high official position\nhas given to Manila a society of the highest and most refined type.\n\nThe process of beautifying and improving the city which is constantly\ngoing on bids fair to give us at no distant day a city of which we may\nwell be proud.\n\nBut let him who intends living well in Manila on a small income bid\nfarewell at once to so idylic a dream, for it costs much to live well\nthere. In the city of Manila one can get almost anything he wishes,\nbut it must be paid for at the price it commands. Especially in the\ncase of eatables, this price is by no means small, because to the\nfirst cost of articles must in most cases be added the expense of\ndistant shipment from American, European, or Australian ports, and not\ninfrequently the cost of long refrigeration must also be taken into\nconsideration. But, expensive though it is, it is very pleasant to\nlive there and those who have once enjoyed it often wish again to\nquaff the cup of its delights.\n\nIn strong contrast to this pleasant life is the life of the quiet\nlittle hamlet away in the distant islands. Indeed, the Filipino from\nthe distant town, who by some good fortune has been to Manila, or, by\na coup de main, has studied in one of the Manila colleges, is looked\nup to in a true hero-worshiping attitude by all who either know him or\nhear of his fame. Life in such a place is one long state of harmless\ninactivity. Not a wave of trouble from the great outer world ever\ndisturbs its peaceful repose. One lounges forever in an air of\nindolent ease and extreme aversion to anything approaching what might\nbe called a respectable effort.\n\nOne arises in the morning about the time the sun's first rays silver\nthe top leaves of the cocoanut trees and then stirs around until nine\nor ten o'clock, when it is found expedient to avoid a further exposure\nto the sun. From then until about five o'clock in the afternoon it is\nbest to take things as they come, even though one of those things be a\nFilipino dinner. But then you may have your vehiclo attached to a\nyoung bull with a ring in his nose and go for a drive. If it is the\ndry season you will probably enjoy the drive unless you object to the\nfrequent clouds of dust swept along by the evening wind. If it is in\nthe rainy season your pleasure will depend to a considerable extent\nupon how wet you get; but, whether the season be wet or dry, your\npleasure will be regulated largely by the state of harmony existing\nbetween the driver and the bull.\n\nIn these quiet secluded nooks successive generations of Filipinos are\nborn, reared, grow old and die in an even chain of events broken only\nby the occasional erection of a new grass house on the identical spot\nwhere its predecessors have stood for ages. The son lives in the house\nof his father, cultivates the same few square feet of soil planted in\nedible roots, climbs the same cocoanut trees, follows the same winding\npath down to the stream, pounds rice in the same mortar and with the\nsame stick that his ancestors have used from time unremembered, and,\nin case of illness, curls up on a grass mat in a corner of the room\nuntil he dies or by some good fortune recovers. Beyond this narrow\nhorizon he never looks. So narrow and contracted is the life that the\nlanguages of two towns a few miles apart are so different that one\nwould scarcely recognize them as belonging to the same race of people.\n\nSuch are the two extremes of life in our new far Eastern provinces:\nthe one is active, progressive, and cosmopolitan; the other, inactive,\ndecadent, and narrow; but, whether one enjoys the first or endures the\nsecond, there comes to him after leaving a longing to lounge again in\ntropic airs and listen to the lullaby of the winds among the palms.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VII. - THE FILIPINO AT HOME.\n\n\nAs one enters a Filipino sitting-room for the first time, there is one\nfeature in the arrangement of the furniture that impresses itself upon\nhim at once, and it may be stated without fear of serious\ncontradiction that this same peculiar feature in its arrangement will\ncontinue to face him, as he enters different homes, about as certainly\nas he crosses the threshold.\n\nThe arrangement referred to is that of one large mirror, one settee,\nand some ten or a dozen chairs that appear to have had a certain\norderly affection for one another. The mirror is hung upon one of the\nlarge interior parts of the house about four feet above the floor. The\nwooden houses in the Philippines are built by setting large posts\nupright into the ground, extending into the air from twenty to thirty\nfeet. Cross timbers are fastened to these upright posts about eight or\nten feet above the ground and then not sawed off even with the posts,\nbut allowed to extend beyond them each way. The framework of the house\nis built upon these extending cross timbers, a style of building by\nwhich these large upright posts are left standing out on the inside of\nthe room from one to three feet from the walls. It is on that one of\nthese posts most nearly opposite the door that the mirror always finds\nits place. Immediately beneath the mirror is the settee; and the\nchairs are arranged in two parallel lines facing one another and at\nright angles with the ends of the settee. However odd this arrangement\nmay appear to one when he first enters a Filipino drawing-room, there\nare two things to be said in its favor. In the first place, it places\nyou face to face with the person with whom you are conversing so that\nyou can watch him,--a matter of no small moment in the Philippines. In\nthe next place, it enables you to give one of the young ladies a\nsheep's-eye in the mirror while the others present are left where\nMoses was in our much abused conundrum.\n\nThe size of the residence and the quality of its furnishings depends\nupon the wealth of the owner. But there is so vast a difference\nbetween the mode of life of the highest class and the tao, or lowest\nclass, that it is well to speak of them separately, and the great\nmiddle class of Filipinos can easily be imagined to occupy the\nintervening ground.\n\nThe rich Filipino's house is usually of wood built upon a wall of\nstone or brick from ten to fifteen feet high. The floors are kept\nhighly polished in his hallway, dressing-room, and bed-rooms. There\nare, of course, no fire-places in any of the rooms, but on some\noccasions something is needed to dry the rain-soaked atmosphere, for\neven in the dry season it has been seen to rain for five successive\ndays and nights without the cessation of a moment.\n\nA long chain of dependents is attached to the household of the rich\nFilipino. The master has his special body servant to be present at all\ntimes to do his master's bidding, in short, to be the visible\nmechanism of his master's volition. So, too, the lady of the house has\nher servant woman to do the slightest bidding of her ladyship. Then\nthere is the cook who is almost invariably a man, a house boy or two,\nand the coachman. These functionaries, with their assistants and\nassistants to the assistants, together with a servant or two for the\nexclusive service of the children, complete the economic household.\n\nSuch a family has an abundance of rice and wheat bread, also of\nchicken and fish with occasional fresh beef. They have also a good\ndeal of dulce. They regularly serve wine and frequently serve beer\non their tables.\n\nIn strong contrast with this mode of life is that of the tao. His\ndiet consists almost wholly of rice and small uncleaned fish boiled\ntogether. As a rule knife, fork, plate, and spoon find no place in his\nhousehold. The rice and fish are boiled in a pot and then allowed to\ncool in the same vessel or poured out to cool in a large earthen or\nwooden bowl. Then Mr. Tao together with Mrs. Tao and all the young\nTaos squat on their heels around the mixture and satisfy that\nintangible thing called the appetite. They do not use chop sticks as\nthe Chinese do, but the rice and fish are caught in a hollow formed by\nthe first three fingers of the right hand. The thumb is then placed\nbehind the mass. It is raised up and poised before the mouth, with a\nskill coming from the evolution of ages, when a contraction of the\nmuscles of the thumb throws the mass into the mouth with a skill that\nis marvelous to any but a Filipino. To judge from the most reliable\ninformation, the poorest class do not have an abundance of food,\nalthough it would seem that such a condition of things would be\nwell-nigh impossible. However, in a census of one hundred school\nchildren there were found six boys and four girls who declared that\nthey had never had enough to eat, and the native teacher stated that\nthis was probably true.\n\nThe wide gulf between the tao and the rich man is filled by the\ngreat middle class of Filipinos.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VIII. - VISIT TO A LEPER COLONY.\n\n\nNot far from our town was a leper colony and the first Saturday that\ncould be spared was set aside for a trip to the place. It happened\nthat none of the other Americans were at leisure on this particular\nmorning, but, rather then delay the trip or miss it altogether, the\nwriter, armed with a revolver, started out alone.\n\nThe road had been described so accurately by one who was supposed to\nknow it that it was deemed well-nigh impossible to miss the way. The\nmain highway was followed to the point where the by-path supposed to\nlead to the settlement turned off through some bamboo thickets and a\nlow tropical wood. This path led straight away towards the sea-coast\nwhere the houses of the colony were said to stand in a cocoanut grove\nby the beach.\n\nUpon arriving at the settlement, a very inhospitable reception was\nreceived from a mangy cur that growled and showed a very uninviting\nset of sharp, white teeth behind his snarling lips. The growling of\nthe dog had attracted the attention of an old man who, with age-bent\nback, was pounding rice in a mortar about fifty yards away. He turned\nslowly around and, upon seeing an intruder into the primitive quiet of\nthe place, gave a sharp, far-reaching call. The sound had scarcely\nrung through the grove when from about a dozen of the little grass\nhouses dotted here and there fifteen or twenty men armed with bolos\ncame out and gathered around the old man. A sense of my danger flashed\nupon me. Three miles from town and alone in a tropical jungle, I could\nbe almost instantly overcome by this band of bolo-men, and the only\nreport that would ever reach my people would be that I had\n\"disappeared.\" Of course, attack was by no means certain, but the\npotentiality of the situation was thrilling. A drawn revolver and the\ngleaming of its shining barrel had the effect of stopping the men, who\nseemed to be hesitating as to a course of action, until a somewhat\ndignified retreat was made to an open space in the rear from where a\nless dignified and a more hasty retreat began which did not stop short\nof Bacalod.\n\nEnough had been seen, however, even in this short visit, to give\nconvincing proof that the settlement visited was no colony of lepers;\nso, that afternoon two servant boys being taken as guides and\ninterpreters, another attempt was made to reach the goal desired.\n\nThis attempt was successful, and, after about two hours of walking, a\nlittle cluster of grass huts snugly hidden by the sea-coast came into\nview. As we approached, one would have thought it a gala-day. Some few\nchildren, apparently from six to thirteen years of age, almost wholly\nnude, were romping and playing in the open space around which the huts\nstood, and no one would ever have thought that any cloud so horrible\nas leprosy could hover over a place apparently so happy.\n\nBy the side of the path as we passed was a man and his wife setting\nout potato plants. His hands were so puffed and his fingers so short\nthat he could scarcely use them, but he was working along as best he\ncould. His wife's feet were so swollen and twisted that she walked\nonly with the greatest difficulty. We passed them by and entered the\nopen space above referred to.\n\nThe children now saw us, and those of them who could darted away like\nfrightened rabbits, each to his own burrow. An old man who was sitting\nin the warm afternoon sun on the little bamboo platform before his hut\nwas aroused from his lethargic repose by the scampering away of the\nchildren. He arose, trembling upon his tottering limbs, all drawn and\ntwisted, and hobbled away into his hut.\n\nThe children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at\nthe doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of\nthe settlement. In a few moments we were surrounded by a circle of\nhuman beings at once so repulsive and so pitiable that its graphic\nvividness can never be accurately portrayed.\n\nThe old man referred to above, having put on a pair of snow-white\npantaloons, appeared now at the doorway of his hut, followed a few\nmoments later by his wife who had evidently clothed herself in the\nbest raiment she had. At a call from the old man, all the men, women,\nand children in the settlement came out of their huts and stood in a\nline before us. The old man was spokesman and in his native visayan\ntongue made a heart-rending appeal for aid which we were powerless to\ngive. Attention was called to a leper woman, apparently about\ntwenty-five years of age, whose face had been attacked by the disease\nand whose appearance was truly pathetic. Upon her hip was a child\nabout a year and a half old and, strange to say, the child showed as\nyet no signs whatever of the disease.\n\nWhat an indissoluble enigma is life! Here in a little cluster of grass\nhuts in a secluded nook of a secluded island of an all but secluded\narchipelago was gathered together a little community of wretched\nnatives, driven by their loathsomeness from association with others\neven of the same half-savage race. Yet here, men and women loved and\nwere married, by mutual trust if not by law, and children were born of\nthe union to live forever under the unspeakable horror that\novershadowed the unfortunate parents. Love, hatred, sorrow, and\njoy--every passion that enters into the complex structure of the human\nheart even here, in this scene of sadness and despair, was playing\napparently as freely as where misfortune and disease had never crossed\nthe portals of life.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER IX. - A \"HIKE.\"\n\n\nWe were lounging lazily in our hammocks at Jimamaylan one evening in\nApril. Supper was just ended, and the soldiers in the post were\ncollected in groups here and there spinning yarns to pass away the\ntime, when a Filipino clad only in a loin cloth came down the street\nat a steadily swinging run and stopped in front of the sentry. He\nbrought the announcement that a band of ladrones had just burned a\nsugar mill and were advancing to sack a barrio about fifteen miles\naway.\n\nThe invitation of the commanding officer to go on a \"hike\" was eagerly\naccepted, and, in ten minutes after the message was given, the troops\nwere on the march followed by two adventurous pedagogues.\n\nDarkness was just closing in as we left the town, but a resplendent\ntropic moon soon made the night almost as brilliant as the day. The\ntrail we followed led over rough and rocky country. Sometimes for a\ndistance of a mile or more we passed over barren wastes of volcanic\nslag poured out in anger by some peak whose convulsions have long\nsince ceased. Again we would descend into a tropical jungle from the\ndense foliage of which the ladrones could have leaped at any moment,\nhad they known of our coming, and annihilated our little band. We\nforded rapid streams with the water at our breasts, and halted only\nonce in that rapid march of fifteen miles.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the town we met a man who was standing\nguard against a surprise by the ladrones. Nothing could well have been\nmuch more grotesque and nothing could much better illustrate the\nabsolutely primitive condition of the Filipinos in the interior of the\nislands than the appearance of this guard. A pair of knee pants, a\nconical grass hat, and a hemp shirt formed his entire apparel. A long\nflat wooden shield, a bolo, and a long bamboo spear with a sharp,\nflat, iron point, completed his equipment for battle.\n\nHere stood the first and the twentieth centuries side by side. The\nFilipino who had advanced only a stage beyond the condition of\nprimitive man with his knife, spear, and wooden shield, stood side by\nside with the American soldier, a representative of modern life with\nhis magazine rifle, his canteen, his knapsack,--with every article of\nhis clothing made to give him the highest possible efficiency as the\nunit of a military organization.\n\nA few yards farther on we met another guard equipped similarly to the\nfirst. Upon reaching the town, news had just been received that a\ndetachment of troops from another post had intercepted the ladrones\nand fought a skirmish with them. The ladrones had escaped and we set\nout in pursuit of them on a chase wilder than a Quixotic dream. We\nwound our way into the mountains behind the town, inquiring at every\ngrass hut we passed whether the band of ladrones had passed that way,\nbut only once was even a trace of them found. Then it was learned that\nat a certain place they had separated into groups of three or four and\ngone glimmering through the dream of things that were. This place was\nin a secluded nook of the mountains where in years gone by some\nadventurous Spaniard had erected a primitive water mill to grind his\nsugar-cane. We had now marched about twenty miles and the feet of the\npedagogues were a mass of blisters. They had reached the point where\nthat form of military maneuvering called \"hiking\" ceased to possess\nany alluring charms. So a native was persuaded to come out of his lone\nmountain hut and hitch up his carabao and cart. He was then made to\nget on the carabao's back, while the aforesaid pedagogues lay down on\nthe sugar-cane pulp that had been put into the body of the cart, and\nthe driver was instructed to start for the post we had left hours\nbefore, and not to stop until he got there. Being uncertain but that\nsome of the ladrones would learn of our having left the body of troops\nand would try the metal of our steel, we at first agreed that neither\nof us should go to sleep, but it was later decided that probably the\ndriver had no greater desire to cross the Styx than his passengers had\nand that in case of danger he would awaken us, so both took a revolver\nin each hand, stretched out supinely and went to sleep.\n\nSuch a sleep! The rough jolting of the cart over an almost impassable\nroad was never enough to break the spell of slumber. When we awoke the\nblazing tropic sun was past the midday mark of morning, shining full\ninto our unprotected and well-nigh blistered faces.\n\nA pack of dogs were heralding our approach to a little village at the\nfoot of the mountains where ponies were procured to take us back to\nthe post."

                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently\nno time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth dimension of Space\nas a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house\nbecame quite quiet.\n\nOn reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up\nagainst a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realize\nhis position. Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\nhundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the\nDowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone\ninto hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains on\none of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who\nhad been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr\nto nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair\nby the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six\nweeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become\nreconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that\nnotorious sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible\nnight when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his\ndressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and\nconfessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox\nout of \u00a350,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card, and swore that\nthe ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back\nto him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because\nhe had seen a green hand tapping at the window-pane, to the beautiful\nLady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round\nher throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin,\nand who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of the\nKing's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he went\nover his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as\nhe recalled to mind his last appearance as \"Red Reuben, or the Strangled\nBabe,\" his d\u00e9but as \"Guant Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,\"\n\nand the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely\nplaying ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And\nafter all this some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him\nthe Rising Sun Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite\nunbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever been treated in this\nmanner. Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance, and remained till\ndaylight in an attitude of deep thought.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III\n\n\nThe next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed\nthe ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. \"I have\nno wish,\" he said, \"to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say\nthat, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,\"--a very just remark,\nat which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.\n\n\"Upon the other hand,\" he continued, \"if he really declines to use the\nRising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him. It\nwould be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside\nthe bedrooms.\"\n\nFor the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the\nblood-stain on the library floor. This certainly was very strange, as\nthe door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept\nclosely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a\ngood deal of comment. Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red,\nthen it would be vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came\ndown for family prayers, according to the simple rites of the Free\nAmerican Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright\nemerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party\nvery much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening. The\nonly person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia, who,\nfor some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the\nsight of the blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was\nemerald-green.\n\nThe second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in\nthe hall. Rushing down-stairs, they found that a large suit of old\narmour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone\nfloor, while seated in a high-backed chair was the Canterville ghost,\nrubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face. The\ntwins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged\ntwo pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained\nby long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United\nStates Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in\naccordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost\nstarted up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a\nmist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so\nleaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase\nhe recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of\ndemoniac laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely\nuseful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single\nnight, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French\ngovernesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly\nlaughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and\nrang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door\nopened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown. \"I am\nafraid you are far from well,\" she said, \"and have brought you a bottle\nof Doctor Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a\nmost excellent remedy.\" The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at\nonce to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an\naccomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family\ndoctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's\nuncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps,\nhowever, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself\nwith becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep\nchurchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.\n\nOn reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the\nmost violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross\nmaterialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what\nreally distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit\nof mail. He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by\nthe sight of a Spectre in armour, if for no more sensible reason, at\nleast out of respect for their natural poet Longfellow, over whose\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\nhour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides it was his own suit.\n\nHe had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament, and had\nbeen highly complimented on it by no less a person than the Virgin Queen\nherself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely overpowered\nby the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen\nheavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees severely, and\nbruising the knuckles of his right hand.\n\nFor some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of\nhis room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.\n\nHowever, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to\nmake a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his\nfamily. He selected Friday, August 17th, for his appearance, and spent\nmost of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in\nfavour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet\nfrilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards evening a\nviolent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was\njust such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to\nmake his way quietly to Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the\nfoot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\nof low music. He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville\nblood-stain by means of Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent. Having reduced\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and\nhis wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead,\nwhile he hissed into her trembling husband's ear the awful secrets of\nthe charnel-house. With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made\nup his mind. She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and\ngentle. A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more\nthan sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the\ncounterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins, he was quite\ndetermined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be done was, of\ncourse, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling\nsensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each\nother, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse,\ntill they became paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw off the\nwinding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white, bleached bones and\none rolling eyeball, in the character of \"Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's\nSkeleton,\" a r\u00f4le in which he had on more than one occasion produced a\ngreat effect, and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of\n\"Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.\"\n\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the\nlight-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves\nbefore they retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still,\nand, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the\nwindow-panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family\nslept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\ncould hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States. He\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his\nmurdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like\nan evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.\n\nOnce he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only\nthe baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange\nsixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\nin the midnight air. Finally he reached the corner of the passage that\nled to luckless Washington's room. For a moment he paused there, the\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's\nshroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was\ncome. He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had\nhe done so than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid\nhis blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was\nstanding a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous\nas a madman's dream! Its head was bald and burnished; its face round,\nand fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\nfeatures into an eternal grin. From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\nlight, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like\nto his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form. On its breast\nwas a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of\nshame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime,\nand, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\n\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's\njack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler. Once in the\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small\npallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes. After a time, however,\nthe brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to\ngo and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight. Accordingly,\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling\nthat, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid\nof his new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins. On reaching\nthe spot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had\nevidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from\nits hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it\nwas leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable\nattitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his\nhorror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a\nrecumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity\nbed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow\nturnip lying at his feet! Unable to understand this curious\ntransformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there,\nin the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:--\n        +------------------------------------+\n        |         YE OTIS GHOSTE             |\n        | Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook, |\n        |    Beware of Ye Imitationes.       |\n        |   All others are counterfeite.     |\n        +------------------------------------+\nThe whole thing flashed across him. He had been tricked, foiled, and\nout-witted! The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his\ntoothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his\nhead, swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\nschool, that, when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds\nof blood would be wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.\n\nHardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of\na distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh,\nand waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\nreason, did not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back\nto his room, thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose. There he\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was\nexceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which this oath\nhad been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second time. \"Perdition\nseize the naughty fowl,\" he muttered, \"I have seen the day when, with my\nstout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow\nfor me an 'twere in death!\" He then retired to a comfortable lead\ncoffin, and stayed there till evening.\n\n\nCHAPTER: IV\n\n\nThe next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were\ncompletely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five\ndays he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point\nof the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want\nit, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a\nlow, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating\nthe symbolic value of sensuous phenomena. The question of phantasmic\napparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a\ndifferent matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large\noriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every month, and he\ndid not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is\nquite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand,\nhe was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.\n\nFor the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as\nusual between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible\nprecaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots,\ntrod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large\nblack velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for\noiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good\ndeal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of\nprotection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he\nslipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a\nlittle humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see\nthat there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a\ncertain degree, it served his purpose. Still in spite of everything he\nwas not left unmolested. Strings were continually being stretched across\nthe corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion,\nwhile dressed for the part of \"Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley\nWoods,\" he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide,\nwhich the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry\nChamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged\nhim, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and\nsocial position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the\nnext night in his celebrated character of \"Reckless Rupert, or the\nHeadless Earl.\"\n\nHe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in\nfact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means\nof it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord\nCanterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome\nJack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\ndown the terrace at twilight. Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\nLord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken\nheart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it\nhad been a great success. It was, however an extremely difficult\n\"make-up,\" if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more\nscientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three\nhours to make his preparations. At last everything was ready, and he was\nvery pleased with his appearance. The big leather riding-boots that went\nwith the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\nfind one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite\nsatisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting\nand crept down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins,\nwhich I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of\nthe colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make\nan effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water\nfell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his\nleft shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed. The shock to his\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\ncould go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold. The only\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\nhad not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences\nmight have been very serious.\n\nHe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,\nand contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in\nlist slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\ndraughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the\ntwins. The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September. He\nhad gone down-stairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that\nthere, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing\nhimself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of\nthe United States Minister and his wife which had now taken the place of\nthe Canterville family pictures. He was simply but neatly clad in a long\nshroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip\nof yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In\nfact, he was dressed for the character of \"Jonas the Graveless, or the\nCorpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,\" one of his most remarkable\nimpersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to\nremember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their\nneighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a quarter-past two o'clock in\nthe morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring. As\nhe was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any\ntraces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a\ndark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads,\nand shrieked out \"BOO!\" in his ear.\n\nSeized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural,\nhe rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him\nthere with the big garden-syringe, and being thus hemmed in by his\nenemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the\ngreat iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to\nmake his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own\nroom in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.\n\nAfter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins\nlay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\nservants, but it was of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings\nwere so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed\nhis great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had\nbeen engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized a wonderful\nclam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse\neuchre, poker, and other American national games, and Virginia rode\nabout the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire,\nwho had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville\nChase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in\nfact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who,\nin reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best\ncongratulations to the Minister's worthy wife.\n\nThe Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the\nhouse, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let\nmatters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the\nyoung Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had\nonce bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice\nwith the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the\nfloor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state that, though\nhe lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but\n\"Double Sixes.\" The story was well known at the time, though, of course,\nout of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt\nwas made to hush it up, and a full account of all the circumstances\nconnected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle's\nRecollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends. The ghost, then,\nwas naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence\nover the Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his\nown first cousin having been married en secondes noces to the Sieur de\nBulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are\nlineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to\nVirginia's little lover in his celebrated impersonation of \"The Vampire\nMonk, or the Bloodless Benedictine,\" a performance so horrible that when\nold Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in\nthe year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which\nculminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after\ndisinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and\nleaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment,\nhowever, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the\nlittle Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal\nBedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.\n\n\nCHAPTER: V\n\n\nA few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out\nriding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting\nthrough a hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go\nup by the back staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past\nthe Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied\nshe saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother's maid, who\nsometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend\nher habit. To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville\nGhost himself! He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of\nthe yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing\nmadly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his hand, and his\nwhole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so forlorn, and so\nmuch out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea\nhad been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity,\nand determined to try and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so\ndeep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she\nspoke to him.\n\n\"I am so sorry for you,\" she said, \"but my brothers are going back to\nEton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy\nyou.\"\n\n\"It is absurd asking me to behave myself,\" he answered, looking round in\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,\n\"quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and\nwalk about at night, if that is what you mean. It is my only reason for\nexisting.\"\n\n\"It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very\nwicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had\nkilled your wife.\"\n\n\"Well, I quite admit it,\" said the Ghost, petulantly, \"but it was a\npurely family matter, and concerned no one else.\"\n\n\"It is very wrong to kill any one,\" said Virginia, who at times had a\nsweet puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.\n\n\"Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very\nplain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about\ncookery. Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent\npricket, and do you know how she had it sent to table? However, it is\nno matter now, for it is all over, and I don't think it was very nice of\nher brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.\"\n\n\"Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost--I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry? I\nhave a sandwich in my case. Would you like it?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you,\nall the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\nvulgar, dishonest family.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Virginia, stamping her foot, \"it is you who are rude, and\nhorrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the\npaints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain\nin the library. First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and\nI couldn't do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the\nchrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese\nwhite, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing\nto look at, and not at all easy to paint. I never told on you, though I\nwas very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for\nwho ever heard of emerald-green blood?\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" said the Ghost, rather meekly, \"what was I to do? It is\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother\nbegan it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I\nshould not have your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of\ntaste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest\nin England; but I know you Americans don't care for things of this\nkind.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\nand improve your mind. My father will be only too happy to give you a\nfree passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind,\nthere will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are\nall Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\nhave a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family ghost.\"\n\n\"I don't think I should like America.\"\n\n\"I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,\" said Virginia,\nsatirically.\n\n\"No ruins! no curiosities!\" answered the Ghost; \"you have your navy and\nyour manners.\"\n\n\"Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week's\nholiday.\"\n\n\"Please don't go, Miss Virginia,\" he cried; \"I am so lonely and so\nunhappy, and I really don't know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I\ncannot.\"\n\n\"That's quite absurd! You have merely to go to bed and blow out the\ncandle. It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\nchurch, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why, even\nbabies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.\"\n\n\"I have not slept for three hundred years,\" he said sadly, and\nVirginia's beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; \"for three hundred\nyears I have not slept, and I am so tired.\"\n\nVirginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like\nrose-leaves. She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked\nup into his old withered face.\n\n\"Poor, poor Ghost,\" she murmured; \"have you no place where you can\nsleep?\"\n\n\"Far away beyond the pine-woods,\" he answered, in a low, dreamy voice,\n\"there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\nsings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold crystal\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\nsleepers.\"\n\nVirginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\n\n\"You mean the Garden of Death,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth,\nwith the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have\nno yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at\npeace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of death's\nhouse, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death\nis.\"\n\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\nthere was silence. She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\n\nThen the ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of\nthe wind.\n\n\"Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?\"\n\n\"Oh, often,\" cried the little girl, looking up; \"I know it quite well.\n\nIt is painted in curious black letters, and is difficult to read. There\nare only six lines:\n    \"'When a golden girl can win\n    Prayer from out the lips of sin,\n    When the barren almond bears,\n    And a little child gives away its tears,\n    Then shall all the house be still\n    And peace come to Canterville.'\n\n\"But I don't know what they mean.\"\n\n\"They mean,\" he said, sadly, \"that you must weep with me for my sins,\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle,\nthe angel of death will have mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\ncannot prevail.\"\n\nVirginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair\nas he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes. \"I am not afraid,\" she said\nfirmly, \"and I will ask the angel to have mercy on you.\"\n\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as\nhe led her across the dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were\nbroidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back. \"Go back! little Virginia,\"\n\nthey cried, \"go back!\" but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly,\nand she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails\nand goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and\nmurmured, \"Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,\"\n\nbut the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When\nthey reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she\ncould not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly\nfading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A\nbitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her\ndress. \"Quick, quick,\" cried the Ghost, \"or it will be too late,\" and\nin a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry\nChamber was empty.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VI\n\n\nAbout ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not\ncome down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia\nanywhere. As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\nevening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all\nalarmed at first, but when six o'clock struck, and Virginia did not\nappear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for\nher, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house. At\nhalf-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\nof their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of\nexcitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly\nremembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies\npermission to camp in the park. He accordingly at once set off for\nBlackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son\nand two of the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire, who was\nperfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too,\nbut Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a\nscuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gipsies had\ngone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as\nthe fire was still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.\n\nHaving sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran\nhome, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the\ncounty, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been\nkidnapped by tramps or gipsies. He then ordered his horse to be brought\nround, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down\nto dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with a groom. He had hardly,\nhowever, gone a couple of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after\nhim, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with\nhis face very flushed, and no hat. \"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,\" gasped\nout the boy, \"but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.\n\nPlease don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year,\nthere would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me back,\nwill you? I can't go! I won't go!\"\n\nThe Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace,\nand was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down\nfrom his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, \"Well,\nCecil, if you won't go back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must\nget you a hat at Ascot.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!\" cried the little Duke, laughing,\nand they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of\nthe station-master if any one answering to the description of Virginia\nhad been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her. The\nstation-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him\nthat a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a\nhat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his\nshutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away,\nwhich he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as there was a\nlarge common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman, but\ncould get no information from him, and, after riding all over the\ncommon, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase\nabout eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found\nWashington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with\nlanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest trace of\nVirginia had been discovered. The gipsies had been caught on Brockley\nmeadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they should be late. Indeed, they had\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's disappearance, as they\nwere very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his\npark, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search.\n\nThe carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone\nover, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any\nrate, Virginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest\ndepression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they\nfound a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\nwas poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and\nhaving her forehead bathed with eau de cologne by the old housekeeper.\n\nMr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up\nsupper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one\nspoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very\nfond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the\nentreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that\nnothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in\nthe morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down\nimmediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight\nbegan to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded\nthey heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder\nshook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a\npanel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out\non the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her\nhand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs.\nOtis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with\nviolent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.\n\n\"Good heavens! child, where have you been?\" said Mr. Otis, rather\nangrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them.\n\n\"Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and\nyour mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these\npractical jokes any more.\"\n\n\"Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!\" shrieked the twins, as they\ncapered about.\n\n\"My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side\nagain,\" murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair.\n\n\"Papa,\" said Virginia, quietly, \"I have been with the Ghost. He is dead,\nand you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was\nreally sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of\nbeautiful jewels before he died.\"\n\nThe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave\nand serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a\nlighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they\ncame to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia\ntouched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves\nin a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated\nwindow. Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was\na gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone\nfloor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers\nan old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its\nreach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was\ncovered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but\na pile of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding\nher little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the\nparty looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\ndisclosed to them.\n\n\"Hallo!\" suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out\nof the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\nsituated. \"Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.\"\n\n\"God has forgiven him,\" said Virginia, gravely, as she rose to her feet,\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.\n\n\"What an angel you are!\" cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round\nher neck, and kissed her.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VII\n\n\nFour days after these curious incidents, a funeral started from\nCanterville Chase at about eleven o'clock at night. The hearse was drawn\nby eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\nnodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\npurple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville\ncoat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\nservants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully\nimpressive. Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up\nspecially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first\ncarriage along with little Virginia. Then came the United States\nMinister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the\nlast carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had\nbeen frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she\nhad a right to see the last of him. A deep grave had been dug in the\ncorner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service\nwas read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, the servants, according to an old custom\nobserved in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as\nthe coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward,\nand laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms. As\nshe did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its\nsilent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a\nnightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of the\nGarden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a\nword during the drive home.\n\nThe next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given\nto Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby\nnecklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen\nof sixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis\nfelt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"I know that in this country mortmain is held to\napply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that\nthese jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg\nyou, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you\nunder certain strange conditions. As for my daughter, she is merely a\nchild, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such\nappurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I\nmay say, is no mean authority upon Art,--having had the privilege of\nspending several winters in Boston when she was a girl,--that these gems\nare of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\nprice. Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you\nwill recognize how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\nin the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such\nvain gauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\nBritish aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who\nhave been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles\nof Republican simplicity. Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box, as a memento of\nyour unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is extremely old, and\nconsequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to\ncomply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good deal\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with medi\u00e6valism\nin any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was\nborn in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned\nfrom a trip to Athens.\"\n\nLord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister's speech,\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile,\nand when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\nsaid: \"My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky\nancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are\nmuch indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck. The jewels\nare clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough\nto take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave\nin a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. As for their being\nheirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or\nlegal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite\nunknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and\nwhen Miss Virginia grows up, I dare say she will be pleased to have\npretty things to wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the\nfurniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to\nthe ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity\nSir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he\nwas really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase.\"\n\nMr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville's refusal, and\nbegged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was\nquite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to\nretain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of\n1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's first\ndrawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the\nuniversal theme of admiration. For Virginia received the coronet, which\nis the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her\nboy-lover as soon as he came of age. They were both so charming, and\nthey loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the\nmatch, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch\nthe Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less\nthan three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to\nsay, Mr. Otis himself. Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke\npersonally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his\nown words, \"was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating\ninfluences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of\nRepublican simplicity should be forgotten.\" His objections, however,\nwere completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the\naisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his\narm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of\nEngland.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to\nCanterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over\nin the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods. There had\nbeen a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir\nSimon's tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it\nsimply the initials of the old gentleman's name, and the verse from the\nlibrary window. The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses,\nwhich she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for\nsome time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There\nthe Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her\nfeet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly\nhe threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her,\n\"Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.\"\n\n\"Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have,\" he answered, smiling, \"you have never told me what\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.\"\n\n\"I have never told any one, Cecil,\" said Virginia, gravely.\n\n\"I know that, but you might tell me.\"\n\n\"Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you. Poor Sir Simon! I owe\nhim a great deal. Yes, don't laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see\nwhat Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than\nboth.\"\n\nThe Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.\n\n\"You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,\" he murmured.\n\n\"You have always had that, Cecil.\"\n\n\"And you will tell our children some day, won't you?\"\n\nVirginia blushed.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.\n\nYet Millet would have us understand that in spite of this, the\nshepherd is performing a duty to humanity not to be underrated. The\nsheep he has so carefully and conscientiously reared will form food\nto-morrow for many a hungry town-dweller. Further, he would have us\nfollow the peasant as he closes the pen for the night and traces his\ntired steps towards his simple home in the village. The frugal and\nhard-earned meal, prepared for him by his wife, who like himself has\nhad her share of duties to occupy her during the day, is partaken of\nsurrounded by a hungry and joyous group of children. Such themes\nsuggested by the simplicity of his own life appealed to him with\nirresistible force, and it is in their portrayal that his greatness is\nmanifested.\n\nPerhaps no season of the year presented the same attraction for Millet\nas the spring. The period when all the earth after its long winter\nsleep is about to waken into new life seems to have always been a\nsource of inspiration to him. In \"The Sower\" he emphasises the fact\nthat the fruits of the harvest are not to be had without due labour\nbeing expended upon the earth. The sloping field, barren of\nvegetation, and crowned at the top with a small clump of trees, is\nbeing broken up by the distant plough drawn by two horses and guided\nby a peasant. The latter figure is one of the noblest of Millet's\ncreations. By his strained and ever-attentive attitude, by his\ncontinuous tramp over the rough and broken ground, he shows us the\nmonotony of his toil. He crosses the field in one direction, only to\nreturn at an interval of a few feet. In the foreground we have the\nsower, a middle-aged man of typical peasant type, on whose left side a\nbag of seeds is slung. With automatic precision he withdraws a\nhandful, and strews it into the furrows open to receive it. So long as\nhe continues in the same track his labour will be well performed, and\nhence his task is just as monotonous as that of his fellow-worker\nhigher up in the field. The silhouetting of these two figures against\nthe light is symbolical of the labour to be expended in life before\nresults are forthcoming.\n\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that in considering the works of\nMillet, one must not judge him from the standpoint of a mere painter.\n\nHis brush is only the means to an end, and by its means he is enabled\nto bring the fruits of his philosophic observation before us in\npermanent form. It has been charged against the \"Angelus\" that it was\nnot a remarkably fine piece of painting, that many a young artist of\nthe present generation is infinitely better equipped, technically\nspeaking, than the master who wrought this celebrated canvas. This may\nin a measure be true, but it must never be forgotten that Millet\nbrought into play exactly the means which could illustrate his meaning\nin the clearest terms. He had not intended, in painting such a\npicture, to produce a work which would astonish his fellow artists\nwith its brilliancy of handling or magnificence of colour. He wanted\nto make the beholder forget the painter and absorb the lesson. This\nquality runs right through the art of Millet, and it is from this\nstandpoint that we are obliged to weigh his merits.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE\n\n\nJean Fran\u00e7ois Millet was born on October 4, 1814, that is at the\nperiod when French art, at any rate as far as landscape painting is\nconcerned, had reached its lowest ebb. Throughout the eighteenth\ncentury the landscape painter had been hard put to make a living. The\ntaste of connoisseurs throughout the century had been for portraits\nand interiors, or for those numerous pastoral subjects which were\ncarried out with so much decorative charm by such men as Watteau and\nBoucher. Such landscape painting as existed was of the type\npopularised by Vernet; it was built upon a curious mixture of Italian\ninfluence coming from Panini and Salvator Rosa. The only evidence of\nrevolt against such a state of affairs we find in the works of Hubert\nRobert and Moreau. These two, and more especially would I direct the\nreader's attention to the latter, struggled hard to break down the\nconventionalities of the time. They endeavoured to infuse some sense\nof atmosphere into their pictures, and whilst frequently their trees\nand figures are painfully formal, they yet stand alone in the French\nschool as the pioneers of a phase of art which was to attain its\nzenith in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBut after the Revolution, and during the whole of the time that France\nwas under the domination of Napoleon, very rigid principles indeed\nwere enforced with regard to the direction that art should take. The\ninnovation which had its commencement in the reign of Louis XVI. swept\neverything before it as it gained force. Classical art and traditions\ndominated the whole French school, and no artist, however great his\nreputation, attempted for many years to swim against the stream. In\nspite of the principles of liberty and equality which were claimed for\nall under the new r\u00e9gime, a terribly strict eye was kept upon any\ninnovations which might break out in the form of a naturalistic art.\n\nThe directors of this new movement failed to see that the conditions\nwhich had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed\naway, and that the latter's supremacy was due to the fact that their\nproductions were symbolical of the loftiest thoughts of their own\nepoch. The art which expresses the ambitions and noblest thoughts of\nits time will alone endure. These expressions are not applicable to\nany other condition than those which called them forth, and hence in\nattempting to purify the rococo which had existed up to the middle of\nthe eighteenth century, by a return to classical traditions, they were\nonly copying that which their predecessors had done, and in so doing\nleft us without any original expression of their own time.\n\nInto such a condition of affairs was Millet born, and he was numbered\namongst that little band of men which included Rousseau, Corot, Dupr\u00e9,\nDiaz, and Daumier, who were to lay the foundations of the modern\nnaturalistic school. At the outset it was seemingly a hopeless\nstruggle they undertook; a struggle against prejudice and influence\nwhich was only to be brought to a victorious culmination after years\nof struggle and disappointment. Of this little band, Millet was\nperhaps the best equipped for the privations which were necessary. He\ncame of a peasant stock who inhabited Gruchy, a small village\nsituated in the commune of Gr\u00e9ville, close to Cherbourg. Grouped\nunderneath the humble roof was the grandmother, who had been left a\nwidow fifteen years before; her son, Jean Louis Nicolas Millet, and\nhis wife and eight children, of which our artist was the second. His\ngrandmother appears to have been a pious old lady, whose chief delight\nwas in her grandchildren, to whom she taught those religious\nprinciples which stood them in good stead in after life. We are told\nthat Millet's father possessed a force of character one does not often\nfind amongst men in his rank of life. He was of a contemplative\ndisposition, and had a keenly developed feeling for natural beauty. He\npossessed moreover a keen appreciation of music, which unfortunately\nhe does not appear to have had much opportunity of cultivating. His\nwife was an excellent housewife and of a religious turn of mind. The\nhouse they occupied, situated quite a short distance from the sea, was\nplaced in a tract of country which, whilst it had rugged and\npicturesque features, was not of a nature which would yield\nextraordinary results under cultivation. It was, therefore, a hard\nstruggle for existence which Millet in his first years saw going\non around him. Not that the family were any the less happy for having\nto work laboriously for their livelihood. They had been brought up\namidst such surroundings; their wants were simple and easily\ngratified, and the tranquillity of the m\u00e9nage more than\ncounterbalanced those doubtful luxuries which easier circumstances\nwould have brought their way. Throughout his life Millet maintained\nthe extreme simplicity he had seen practised in the home of his\nchildhood, and long years afterwards he was accustomed to look back\nwith pleasureable memories upon his early years.\n\nGruchy, situated in one of the wildest parts of Normandy, feels the\nfull effect of every storm which blows up from the Atlantic. There is\nnothing to shelter the exposed hamlets studded along the coast from\nthe fury of the western gale, and the rocks are but too often strewn\nwith the wrecks of vessels which have come to grief in that terrible\nsea. Millet in his youth must have witnessed many of these\ncatastrophes. Quite a number of drawings by him are extant\nrepresenting succour being extended to some vessel in difficulties, or\nthe hauling up of some wreckage on to the rocks. The studious boy\nmust have been impressed as he saw the sternness of the combat in his\nnative country between men and nature; the wind-swept fields, and\nhills bare to the point of savageness. The very trees themselves\ndwarfed and gnarled; in their struggle with the elements they have\nbeen made tough and hardy as the inhabitants of the country\nthemselves, and, stunted as they are, yet show well that they can\nresist the force of the fiercest storm. The brooding and contemplative\ncharacter of the father having descended to the son, we can quite\nimagine the effect such surroundings would have upon him. As he looked\nback in after years upon his roamings in his native country, he\nappreciated the awe-inspiring character of the scenery in which he had\nbeen born. He would doubtless recall many a walk amidst the fields\nwith the wind blowing in his face as it rushed in from the Atlantic,\nthe rain beating hard upon the freshly ploughed fields, and the\ndistant figure of the ploughman struggling hard with his team against\nthe stiff sou'wester. The great mass of vapour overhead whirled before\nthe violence of the storm, casting grey and pearly light over the\nwhole scene, whilst far away on the top of the hill a clump of trees,\nbent with their resistance to the wind, are silhouetted against the\nsky. Many a drawing of this kind we encounter in the later work of\nMillet, which shows how his thoughts harked back in certain moments to\nthe scenes he had left behind him for ever.\n\nWe know that on one or two occasions he returned to Gruchy. Once or\ntwice he had urgent business which took him back, but sometimes he\nwent with no other purpose than to renew acquaintance with the scenes\nof yore.\n\nLittle Jean Fran\u00e7ois was his grandmother's favourite. It was she who\ntaught him the names of things which surrounded him, and perhaps\ndirected his thoughts in the channels to which they were finally to be\ndevoted. Her brother Charles, who formed one of the family, used to\ntake him for walks, telling him stories on the way. Millet was\ndevotedly attached to this old man, and when at the age of seven years\nhe lost him, the gap in his life thus left made an impression upon his\nmemory never to be effaced.\n\nFive years afterwards he was placed in the hands of the vicar for the\npurpose of preparing him for his first communion. The good man seems\nto have been taken with the child; he found him so attentive to all\nnatural phenomenon which was passing around him and intelligent in an\nunusual degree. He quickly learnt a considerable amount of Latin,\nwhich introduced him to the great classics. Unfortunately for Millet,\nthe vicar accepted an offer of transference to a better parish in the\nvicinity. The boy had made such progress with his master that it was\ndecided that he should go with him to his new abode. He was, however,\nso missed in his own home, that when he came back for his first\nholidays it was decided that he should not return.\n\nHe now gave serious attention to the agricultural pursuits of his\nfather. He threw himself heartily into the work of the farm, and\nassisted in the work of sowing and harvesting, of pruning and\nthrashing according to the season. His spare time was occupied in\nreading with avidity various masterpieces of literature. The authors\nhe found at hand were such as F\u00e9n\u00e9lon and Bossuet, but he developed a\ndecided preference, which lasted till the end of his life, for Virgil\nand the Bible.\n\nIt was at this time that his taste for art began to be developed.\n\nHe drew the objects he found around him, and soon acquired sufficient\nconfidence in his skill to execute a large drawing representing two\nshepherds keeping guard over their sheep. These first efforts date\nfrom about his seventeenth year, and foretell the advent of the style\nin which he was later to become pre-eminent.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE MIGRATION TO PARIS\n\n\nHow frequently has it happened that the first years in the life of a\ngenius have been employed in labour quite different from that to which\nthey should have been directed. Such a state of affairs the more often\noccurs when the sense of duty has been strong enough to overcome\ntemporarily the inclination to pursue the natural bent. In the case of\nMillet, however, the early years which he devoted to the farm and its\npursuits were by no means wasted. It is on record that he became very\nproficient in the various duties in which he was engaged, but at the\nsame time we can be quite sure that his extraordinary faculties of\nobservation were constantly being brought into play, and the fruits of\nhis observations are to be seen in the pictures of his mature period.\n\nA considerable portion of his spare time was taken up with drawing,\nnot only the persons and objects he found around him, but also\nsubjects suggested to him by the books he was in the habit of reading.\n\nHis family, so far from throwing any obstacles in his way, encouraged\nhim. In fact it was his father who took him first to Cherbourg in\norder to show a painter of that town, named Mouchel, the early\nproducts of his son's genius. The decision at which Millet p\u00e8re had\narrived was prompted by a drawing in charcoal of an old peasant\nwalking along the road, which had struck him forcibly as being a work\nof extraordinary merit. It says much for Mouchel's breadth of mind\nthat he was equally impressed with the drawings. A man who had been\nbrought up in the school of David, and who had lived in one of the\nmost reactionary periods of French art, was hardly to be expected to\ntake kindly to a style so diametrically opposed to all the traditions\ninto which he himself had been inculcated; certainly the young\nMillet, who had now arrived at the age of eighteen, had not developed\nthe extraordinary freedom which his works of ten years later\ndemonstrate. But there was sufficient originality even in his early\ndrawings to call forth condemnation from a man who had been so\nsaturated with the teaching of David.\n\nHe prevailed upon Millet to leave his son with him, and set him to\nwork to copy many well-known works of art which he brought before his\npupil by means of engravings. Two months were spent in this way when\nnews reached Millet that his father had been seized with sudden\nillness, and he was obliged in the circumstances to return to\nGr\u00e9ville. He arrived to find the old man unconscious, and very shortly\nafterwards he died.\n\nThis misfortune awoke in Millet a sense of duty which compelled him to\ndesert his studies in Cherbourg and superintend the management of the\nfarm. For some time he devoted himself entirely to his new duties, but\nthe struggle betwixt duty and genius continued; he gave himself to his\nwork with all the energy at his disposal, but his thoughts were ever\nwandering to his art.\n\nAdded to his own inclinations, his grandmother, who perceived his\nextraordinary gifts, strongly persuaded him to devote his attention\nentirely to art, and consequently after some little time he decided to\nreturn to Cherbourg. Here he entered the studio of M. Langlois, an\nartist whose reputation in the town was considerable. Again in this\nworthy man he came in contact with a painter who had been brought up\nentirely under classical influence. Langlois, who had in his early\ndays been a pupil of Gros, had absorbed the classical tradition to\nsuch an extent as to be incapable of appreciating any other style. He\nappears to have endeavoured to mould Millet in his own method rather\nthan develop the latent genius which the latter possessed. The\nincompatibility of these two men speedily caused the younger to strike\nout in his own way. He saw more good in frequenting the museums and\nmaking copies of such works as appealed to him than in listening to\nthe advice of his teacher. All this occurred, however, without any\nbreach of friendship occurring. On the contrary, Langlois, after\nperceiving the futility of inducing his pupil to follow in his\nfootsteps, did all he could to advance his interests.\n\nBy means of his influence some of Millet's drawings were brought\nbefore the Municipal Council, and Langlois suggested that Millet\nshould be sent to Paris in order to further his development, and that\nthe Council should set aside a modest pension to meet his requirements\nin that city. The discussion appears to have been very prolonged, and\nupon the question being put to a vote it was only carried by means of\nthe casting vote of the mayor. Four hundred francs was at first\nallotted to him in this way, which was further increased shortly\nafterwards to six hundred. Such encouragement, meagre though it was,\nwas sufficient to give him a foothold in the metropolis. He left\nCherbourg in January 1837, on a cold and raw day, the snow falling\nheavily throughout the entire journey, and arrived in Paris in a very\ndisheartened condition. The miserable weather, coupled with the long\njourney in which he had had time to think of the small sum which lay\nbetween him and starvation, going to a city which he had never seen\nbefore, had all served to work upon his nerves, and he entered the\ngreat city sick at heart and very despondent.\n\nOne of the first visits he made after he was somewhat settled down in\nParis was to the Louvre. Here he was brought into contact for the\nfirst time with many masters, who were to mould his yet plastic\ntemperament into the form which enabled him to give to the world, in\nlater years, so many masterpieces. As I have said before, it was\nMantegna who first captivated him, and the influence of the mighty\nPaduan was never finally to be shaken off. Michel Angelo awed him with\nhis sublimity; his classical severity tempered with intense humanism,\nhis masculine strength, were bound to have their effect upon so\nserious a character as Millet. Strange as it may seem to those who are\nbut superficially acquainted with his art, and are only too apt to\njudge him by the influence he has had upon modern French painting, he\nwas fascinated with the antique. The traditions of Phidias and\nPraxiteles, in the form in which they had been transmitted through the\ngreatest minds of the Renaissance, were ever the factors which guided\nhim throughout his career. It was this same spirit which impelled his\nfervid admiration for Nicolas Poussin, a master who to-day is sadly\nunderrated and but little understood. It was the mysteries of line,\nthe wonders of pose and composition rather than the magic of colour\nwhich appealed to him. He had a profound admiration for the glowing\ncanvases of Titian and Rubens, but he could never overlook entirely\ntheir defects of drawing or, in the case of Rubens, the tendency to\nvulgarity. From his remarks in after years it would appear that he was\nbaffled with the mysticisms of Velazquez and Rembrandt; pure painting\nitself could never hold him. He needed to grasp the message which lay\nbehind it before he felt fully taken into the confidence of the\npainter; and as the minds of the Dutchman and the Spaniard ran in\nquite different channels to his own, they spoke with a language he\nnever understood. That he had a perceptive and critically independent\nmind may be gauged from his enthusiasm for Delacroix, whose work he\nencountered for the first time at the Luxembourg.\n\nDuring this period of study he was carefully considering under what\nmaster he should place himself. His choice unhappily fell upon\nDelaroche. To any one acquainted with the work of the latter master,\na more unsuitable selection could not have been made. Delaroche and\nthe painters who surrounded him can be appropriately described as\nconstituting the back-wash of the Empire style, which had reached its\nclimax with David. His subjects were always treated with academic\nreserve. No pyrotechnics were permitted; on the contrary, an\neverlasting and mistaken striving for finish was encouraged:\noriginality was sternly suppressed. To paint human life as it really\nwas, was too vulgar for any of the painters of this time. They held\nthe public taste enslaved for years. An innovator such as Millet was\ndestined to become found his position almost untenable. The band of\ncritics and painters formed a monopoly which it seemed almost\nimpossible to break down, and it was only after years of bitter and\ndetermined struggle that the school of nature finally routed its\nopponent.\n\nDelaroche doubtlessly found the peasant painter a little rude both in\nhis person and in his ideas about art. He paid but little attention to\nthe young man who had placed himself in his hands, and devoted all his\ntime to students who were more amenable to his influence. A\ntemperament so sensitive as Millet's was bound to notice this\nneglect, and consequently after a time he became so discouraged that\nhe ceased to frequent Delaroche's studio. Another very good reason for\nthis action was the lack of resources to continue his payments. Even\nduring the time he had been with Delaroche he lost no opportunity of\nturning a few honest francs by painting the portraits of any who could\nbe got to sit to him. Delaroche, however, had a more kindly heart than\nMillet imagined. He seems to have found out the real distress of the\nyoung artist, and to have assisted him pecuniarily in many ways, and\nthere is no doubt that he appreciated the talent of the young Norman\nmuch more than he cared to own. Many of his remarks on record would\nserve to show that Delaroche already felt that his pupil was destined\nto be one of the leaders of the movement which was finally to\noverthrow his own style, and doubtlessly felt a great admiration for a\nman who had the courage and strength to swim against rather than with\nthe current.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STRUGGLE FOR RECOGNITION\n\n\nFreed from all encumbrances save poverty, Millet was now to work out\nhis own destiny according to the dictates of his genius. He joined a\nfriend named Marolle, and the two together occupying a very small\napartment endeavoured to eke out an existence. It was only too soon\napparent that young as he was, and the taste of the public being not\nyet ready for development upon the lines his genius directed him, that\nhis livelihood could not be secured by endeavouring to sell such\nsubjects as appealed to him. In these straits he turned to\nportrait-painting, just as many great painters before and since him\nhave done. That the struggle was very keen can well be imagined by the\nfact that he was unable to obtain more than five to ten francs apiece;\nand, as commissions were very scarce, he was hard put to gain the\nmeans of subsistence. This state of affairs lasted until 1840, in\nwhich year he endeavoured to obtain admission to the Salon with two\nportraits, one of which was that of his friend. This, however, was\nrejected, and the other picture, although accepted, was unnoticed by\neither the critics or the public.\n\nHaving occasion the next year to pay a visit to Cherbourg, he felt\nobliged to report himself to the Municipal Council who had had the\ngenerosity to send him in the first place to Paris. Its worthy members\nexpressed themselves as but little satisfied with the result of their\ninvestment; they claimed that they had had as yet but little to show\nfor their money, and they suggested, partly as a means of\ndemonstrating that they had had some little return, and also, in order\nto see of what stuff their prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was made, that he should paint a\nportrait of the recently deceased mayor. As Millet had not been\npersonally acquainted with that worthy citizen, and as the only guide\nwhich could be supplied him was a portrait made in miniature when he\nwas a young man of some twenty-three or twenty-four years of age, the\ntask was by no means easy. However, the artist set to work with a\nwill, and finally accomplished the picture to his own satisfaction.\n\nUpon it being shown to the Council, one and all declared, as any one\nwith the slightest knowledge of such matters could have told them\nbefore it was commenced, that it bore not the least resemblance to the\ndefunct magistrate. They therefore demurred at the three hundred\nfrancs they had agreed to pay him for the portrait, and offered him\none-third of that amount instead. Millet was deeply offended by the\ninsult, and informed the Council that he made them a present of the\npicture.\n\nIt was during this short visit to his native country that he met his\nfirst wife, a Mlle. Ono, whose portrait he had painted. From the first\nshe was very delicate, and he lost her after much suffering, three\nyears later. His second wife was Mlle. Catherine Lemaire, who was\ndestined to be the companion of his struggles until the end of his\nlife.\n\nMeanwhile Millet was occupied with subjects which he thought would\nappeal to the general public. A number of classical pictures date from\nthis epoch. It was an endeavour on his part to fall in as far as\npossible with the current taste, and so supply means of subsistence\nfor his family. At the same time he did not neglect his favourite\nsubjects, and many are the wonderful studies of peasant life which\ndate from these years. His reputation had so far advanced that he was\noffered the position of teacher of drawing in the college at\nCherbourg. It must have been only after prolonged deliberation that he\nrefused the proffered post. Here a certain annual stipend was assured\nhim, and if it was not large in itself it would at any rate suffice to\nkeep the wolf from the door. He preferred, however, to return to Paris\nand work out his own destiny as best he might.\n\nMillet, who lived at this time in the Rue Rochechouart, began to\nsurround himself with that little group of friends who remained\nfaithful to him until the end of his career. Amongst the earliest were\nCharles Jacque and Diaz: the latter had several clients amongst the\nsmall dealers, whom he induced to visit Millet's studio and make now\nand again a small purchase.\n\nMillet now became a fairly regular contributor to the Salon, but\ngenerally sent some classical or religious picture as well as one of\nhis peasant subjects. For example, in 1848 he sent the marvellous\nstudy of \"The Winnower,\" which we all know so well, accompanied by a\ncanvas, \"The Captivity of the Jews at Babylon.\" The latter, however,\nwas so badly received that he utilised the canvas upon its return for\na large picture of a \"Shepherdess tending her Sheep.\"\n\nIn spite of the headway that he was making, the struggle for existence\nseemed keener than ever, and but for the kindness of friends he and\nhis family would frequently have actually wanted for food. A timely\nadvance of one hundred francs obtained for him from the Minister of\nFine Arts, together with a commission from the State, for which he was\npaid the sum of eighteen hundred francs, were for some time the only\nrelief he obtained from his embarrassments. That he was not particular\nas to how he earned his daily bread is apparent from the fact that he\ndid not despise an order for a shop sign for a midwife, for which he\nwas paid the miserable amount of thirty francs.\n\nThe year 1848 was not an encouraging one for a painter who was\nstanding on the threshold of his career. The whole of Europe was\nseething with revolution. A repetition of the fearful year of 1792 was\neverywhere expected. The struggle betwixt reaction and property on the\none hand, and lawlessness and revolution on the other, was being waged\nwith grim determination. The issue was for long in the balance. One\nnever knew from one day to another what was going to happen. In such a\ndeplorable state of affairs men's minds were running on politics and\nwars rather than upon art. Millet amongst the rest was called upon to\nshoulder the musket, and it can be easily imagined with what\nreluctance he did so.\n\nParis, the great centre of art, had yet not afforded him much\nencouragement. Life was dear in the big city, and surrounded on all\nsides by bricks and mortar he was not free to go out into the fields\nand study the objects which were uppermost in his mind. He resolved to\nescape from it, and once having put the plan into execution he never\nreturned.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET IN HIS MATURITY\n\n\nThe Barbizon of 1850 was a very different place from the Barbizon of\nto-day. The world fame of the men who passed a quiet and strenuous\nexistence in the little village has transformed it into a tourist\nresort, with restaurants and caf\u00e9s, the stopping-places for\nwaggonettes which in summer bring their daily load of sightseers,\neager to see the homes of the painters whose names are now household\nwords.\n\nIt would have been well-nigh impossible for the little band to have\nchosen a more suitable spot for their labours. Rousseau and Millet,\nmuch as they were drawn towards each other by the tie of a sympathetic\ndisposition and by their common interest in art, yet were widely\ndissimilar from one another in their outlook upon art and their\nmethods of worship at the common shrine. Rousseau--one can see it from\nevery picture he painted--loved with all the yearning of a passionate\nand restless temperament the inanimate in Nature. Observe with what\nfidelity he draws his trees, with what caressing tenderness his clouds\nand skies are treated; solitude appealed to him above all things, and\nif here and there he was obliged to insert a few figures to complete\nhis composition, one instinctively feels that he would rather have\nsubstituted a group of cattle or a flock of sheep. In the glades of\nthe forest, far from the busy haunts of men, with the glorious\nsunlight penetrating from above, the breeze moaning through the\nbranches, he was happy. A wild and turbulent temperament such as his\nnot infrequently discovers exquisite enjoyment amidst such perfect\ntranquillity.\n\nBarbizon, situated on the fringe of the great forest of Fontainebleau,\ntherefore, permitted Rousseau to come into daily contact with the\nscenes which so appealed to him.\n\nMillet, on the other hand, was absorbed in the peasant. The man who\ntilled the soil and raised the produce humanity requires for its\nsubsistence by the sweat of his brow; the manifold duties of the\nlabourer, his life and sorrows, appealed to him with irresistible\nforce. An unpeopled track of wild and uncultivated land would not call\nforth any emotion in him, no matter how sublime the scenery might be.\n\nThe life of the village, spreading itself into the vast and fertile\nplain behind, held him absorbed; a peasant himself and living amongst\nthe people he so loved, he was in a position to bring before an\nunthinking world the poignant monotony of their useful lives.\n\nUpon their first arrival at Barbizon, the two artists put up at a\nsmall inn, working all day in a tiny place they had rented from some\npeasants and fitted up as a studio. The inconveniences of this\narrangement were soon apparent, and shortly afterwards Millet took a\nsmall house which was destined to be his abode for the remainder of\nhis life; an old barn in the immediate vicinity meanwhile provided him\nwith an excellent studio.\n\nFrom this period onward we must date the greatest productions of the\nmaster, the works which have induced more thought than those of any\nother peasant painter. A peasant among peasants, his life was of the\nmost rigid simplicity. Behind his little abode a large garden\nstretched away almost to the fringe of the forest itself, and here he\nwas accustomed to work every morning, growing a portion of the food\nnecessary to the sustenance of his family. The afternoon he devoted to\npainting, whilst the evening was given over to intercourse with his\nlittle circle of friends. The simplicity and tranquillity of his life\naroused the whole of his powers to action, and surrounded with\neverything he valued in life he was supremely happy.\n\nThe country around Barbizon appealed to him irresistibly. The\ntimber-studded plains, the gently undulating, highly cultivated\nfields, presented a strange contrast to the wild and rugged country\namidst which he had spent his childhood, and no doubt conduced to the\ndevelopment of a more refined and contemplative style than he would\notherwise have acquired. Upon his few visits to his native country he\nappears to have been more impressed than ever with its austerity, and\nthe drawings which these journeys called forth bore ample evidence of\nthis feeling in him.\n\nLack of the necessary funds to carry on even his simple m\u00e9nage was\never the bane of Millet's life. On many occasions Sensier, his\nintimate friend and afterwards his biographer, informs us he dissuaded\nhim from suicide.\n\nThe sums that he owed, small though they were, rendered him in\nconstant fear of the brokers. With creditors so importunate in their\ndemands for satisfaction, and with the constant lack of recognition,\nwhich was his lot, it is astonishing that Millet achieved so much. He\nwas relieved more than once by the kind-hearted and ever faithful\nRousseau, who when his friend was sorest pressed found some delicately\nhidden means to relieve him. It was he who acquired for 4000 francs\nthe wonderful \"Peasant grafting a Tree,\" when the picture failed to\nfind a purchaser; and in order that Millet should not be aware of his\ngenerosity, he made the offer in the name of an imaginary American.\n\nThis sort of goodness he repeated more than once, and it redounds\nstill more to his credit when we remember that Rousseau himself was\nnot infrequently in pecuniary difficulties.\n\nA constant succession of important works made their appearance during\nthe first ten years Millet spent at Barbizon. The first was the\nwell-known \"Sower,\" which has ever been one of the most popular of his\npictures. Then came the far finer \"Peasants going to Work,\" which for\nmany years was in an English Collection. The \"Gleaners,\" perhaps the\nnoblest canvas the master ever painted, dates from 1857, in which year\nit was seen at the Salon; the celebrated \"Angelus\" followed it two\nyears later. The prices which Millet obtained for this series of\nremarkable works was fantastically small. The \"Gleaners\" brought him a\npaltry 2000 francs, whilst he accounted himself lucky to encounter an\namateur who gave him the same sum for the small \"Woman feeding Fowls.\"\n\nThe \"Angelus,\" which was never exhibited, was sold in the year it was\npainted to a Monsieur Feydeau, an architect, for 1800 francs. It then\npassed through several hands before the late Monsieur Secr\u00e9tan\ncompeted up to 160,000 francs before he became possessed of the prize\nat the John Wilson sale.\n\nThe purchase, however, proved a sound investment, for upon the\ndispersal of his collection it was knocked down for 553,000 francs to\na Monsieur Proust, acting on behalf of the French Government. The\nlatter, however, when they gave the commission to buy the picture, had\nno idea that such a high value would be placed upon it, and\nconsequently refused to ratify the sale; a syndicate now came upon the\nscene, who took it to America. The price, however, proved greater than\neven the millionaires of the States were prepared to give, and the\ncanvas again returned to France, where it found a resting-place in the\ncollection of Monsieur Chauchard, who paid the enormous sum of 800,000\nfrancs for its possession.\n\nIn 1859 Millet sent two works to the Salon, a \"Woman grazing her Cow,\"\nand \"Death and the Woodman.\" The latter, one of the most\nphilosophical of Millet's pictures, which to-day is the principal\nattraction of the Jacobsen Museum at Copenhagen, was rejected.\n\nDisappointments of this kind came with such systematic regularity to\nthe painter that he must have become proof against them. He always had\nbitter enemies amongst the critics, who never failed to pour abuse\nupon his method and his subjects. Even a number of his fellow artists\njoined in the chorus of disapproval. But the vehemence with which he\nwas attacked was striking evidence of the impression he was making and\nthe inward sense of his own powers; and the fact that he was working\nout his destiny according to the dictates of his own genius supported\nhim against this outpouring of prejudice and malice. The social side\nof life appealed to him more strongly as the years rolled on, and the\nmurmurings which had been heard in 1859 as to the socialistic\ntendencies of \"Death and the Woodman\" swelled to a roar when the\nstupendous \"Man with the Hoe\" was exhibited fourteen years later. The\nlatter, one of the most virile studies of depraved humanity which the\nworld has ever seen, has always been a favourite with social\nreformers, and has inspired one remarkable poem. Even his most\nimplacable critics were disarmed before this canvas; its power was\nmagnetic; it was an inspiration, soul moving and trenchant.\n\nHis financial difficulties never completely dispersed. At one time, in\norder to insure himself a little tranquillity, he made a contract with\ntwo speculators, whereby they were to become possessors of all the\nwork he produced for three years, in consideration of their assuring\nhim a thousand francs a month. A great number of Millet's finest\nproductions passed thus through their hands, including the \"Return\nfrom the Fields\" and the \"Man with the Hoe.\" The partners were not\nlong in quarrelling, and after a lawsuit had been fought, Millet was\nleft in the hands of a man who frequently would not or could not pay\nhim in ready money, and whose bills he was frequently forced to\ndiscount at considerable loss.\n\nOne little gleam of sunshine rendered his later days happy. This was a\ncommission from a Colmar banker, Monsieur Thomas by name, who required\nfour allegorical compositions representing the Seasons, to decorate\nhis rooms. The artist was overjoyed by this piece of good fortune,\nand immediately commenced a most conscientious study of such mural\ndecoration as was within reach, in order that he might do full justice\nto his patron. He paid frequent visits to Fontainebleau and the\nLouvre, and even desired a friend to inquire if he could not obtain\nreproductions of the frescoes at Herculaneum and Pompeii. In spite of\nall this elaborate preparation, the subjects were not such as appealed\nto his genius, and in spite of them being well and soundly painted, we\nare told that they presented no features which called for special\ncomment.\n\nHe found, however, a much more genial occupation in accomplishing a\nseries of drawings ordered by a Monsieur Gavet, who paid the artist\n1000, 700, and 450 francs each, according to their size. He made\naltogether ninety-five drawings in this way, and it is said that this\ngentleman had in his possession the finest work in black and white and\nwater-colour the artist ever executed.\n\nTowards the latter end of his life the death of dear relatives and\nfriends cast a sorrowful gloom over him. Amongst the latter Rousseau,\nwho expired in his presence on the 22nd of December 1867, was\nperhaps the loss which seemed to him hardest to bear. A staunch and\ntrusty friend, who was to be relied upon when his prospects seemed the\nmost hopeless, he had been one of the very few who had appreciated\nMillet's talents at their full worth, and who, moreover, scanty as his\nown means were, was ever ready to stretch out his hand to assist his\nstruggling friend.\n\nShortly afterwards Millet paid a visit to his patron, Herr Hartmann,\nat M\u00fcnster, and from here he went for a short time into Switzerland.\n\nUpon his return he devoted himself with great earnestness to work, and\nachieved a certain success at the Salons with his exhibits. The\noutbreak of the war with Germany caused him to migrate with his family\nto Cherbourg, where he thought he might continue to work, removed as\nfar as possible from the scenes of carnage and struggle which were\ngoing on farther east. Transported once more amongst the scenes of his\nchildhood, he felt an increased impetus to production, and when he\nreturned to Barbizon late in 1871, he brought with him a number of\ncanvases of the highest quality; conspicuous amongst them was the\nwonderful \"Gr\u00e9ville Church,\" now in the Louvre.\n\nThe anxieties of his troublous life were, however, beginning to show\ntheir effect upon his constitution; a persistent cough developed, and\nalthough an amelioration would occasionally occur, it was always\nsucceeded by a worse condition than before. His health suffered a\ngeneral decline, and he finally breathed his last on the 20th of\nJanuary 1875. He was buried in the little cemetery of Chailly, beside\nhis friend Rousseau, amidst the scenery they both loved so well.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE MAN AND HIS ART\n\n\nMillet is an instance of an artist working out his own destiny,\nimpelled by irresistible genius, in the teeth of seemingly\ninsurmountable obstacles. He started life with enormous disadvantages;\nwithout friends in influential circles to spread his fame or plead his\ncause; without money to enable him to outlive and triumph over the\nignorant fanaticism of critics and artists, so soaked in the\nconventionalised art of their time that they had not perception enough\nto appreciate the full meaning of that naturalistic movement, which\nwas finally to sweep away the quasi-classic art they boasted of with\nsuch bombastic effusion. The path was hard and thorny, and his triumph\nwas not finally consummated until after his death. He himself found\nhis only satisfaction in the fact that he had lived his life according\nto the dictates of his genius, and had achieved the maximum of which\nhe was capable.\n\nMillet and our own Cotman were somewhat kindred spirits; there is much\nmore affinity between the work of the two men than is apparent to any\none who has not closely studied them. The marvellous \"Breaking the\nClod,\" now happily permanently housed at the British Museum, betrays\nthe same tremendous conception and broad outlook which characterises\nmany a drawing of Millet's. Both highly strung to a painful extent,\nthey were each conscious of their inability to curb the power which\nprescribed a certain course for them, and in spite of pecuniary\ndifficulties and unpopularity, an inevitable result of their intense\noriginality, they pursued a steady course to the end of their lives.\n\nThe socialistic doctrines which have been read into the work of Millet\nare rather the outcome of the world's uneasy conscience being brought\nface to face with a crushing indictment of existing conditions, than\nof any design on the artist's part to further the cause of a political\npropaganda by means of his art. This somewhat extravagant reading into\nhis art has certainly been carried to excess. Particularly has such\nbeen the case in America, where a large number of his finest works are\nat present to be found, curiously enough in the hands of enormously\nwealthy people, who are frequently perhaps the least able to\nunderstand the real meaning of his message.\n\nComing from a peasant stock, his sympathies were always with the\npeasant; it was the only class he understood or cared for. He lived as\none of them, and shared to a large extent in their labour. He has been\ndesignated, not inappropriately, the philosopher in sabots. Rightly or\nwrongly he has come to be looked upon as one of the high priests of\ncommunistic doctrines. Few pictures have been so anathematised as the\n\"Man with the Hoe,\" and perhaps none have done more to inculcate\nsympathy with the degradation of the lower orders of the human race.\n\nThe revolting brutality and vacancy of that face haunts the\nimagination. Is it possible that fellow-creatures so utterly debased\nby toil and neglect exist? Millet dispels any doubt upon the question\nby bequeathing to humanity this trenchant portrait. By no means\nlimited to Barbizon or France, these poor creatures exist in every\ncountry, and curiously enough are considered an essential element in\neach country's development.\n\nThis poignantly human note is observable in almost every work Millet\nwrought; his passionate sympathy with his fellow-man is the keynote of\nhis art. The wood-cutter in his arduous toil, the shepherd in his\nsolitariness, the labourer turning the soil with unvarying and\nlaborious monotony, the mother caring for her children--all carry the\nsame message for him of that strange and incomprehensible mingling of\njoy and sadness we call life. Like many great minds before and since\nhis time, our artist found the greatest joy in life in a placid and\nnever changing melancholy. But the peasants he chose knew nothing of\nthe sadness he saw in them. Completely inured to their toil, and\nsubdued by it, with no refining or uplifting influence to stimulate\nthem, they knew nothing, aspired to nothing beyond what they were; it\nwas left to Millet to supply the \"might have been.\" He saw the inky\nblackness of the mind of the \"Man with the Hoe,\" the pathetic\ninequality between the mounted farmer directing the safe storage of\nhis crop, and the stooping figures of the \"Gleaners\" eager to scrape\nup the miserable crumbs which had fallen from the rich man's table. He\ntraced the lives of these simple folk until we arrive at the grim and\ngaunt figure of Death, who, as he grasps the woodman by the shoulder,\nreminds him that his course is finished and that he, in common with\nall his fellow-men, must enter the great unknown land from which there\nis no return. It is a sad and melancholy art, vibrating with purity\nand truth, the outpouring of a great soul yearning to express itself\nto the utmost of its power. The mind and character of the man can be\nread in every line and in every touch of the brush. His drawings and\netchings are even more searching in their virility than his pictures.\n\nThere is a spontaneousness about them we search for in vain in his\nwork in oil and pastel. In black and white his intensely emotional\nmind found a swift method of expression; in the laboriousness of oil\npainting he was fettered with the complications of the medium. It can\nbe fairly said that only in one or two paintings--a notable example\ncan be cited in the wondrous \"Sawyers\" at South Kensington--does he\nrise to the height of a great painter. Millet was a poet, a\nphilosopher, a great thinker, and the means he chose for expressing\nhimself were those which were best fitted to his purpose. His\npredilections in art were concentrated upon the greatest, and\nconsequently the men who appealed to him were the thinkers of the\nages. Mantegna and Correggio, Michel Angelo and the mighty Greeks,\nthese were the masters who left their impress upon his mind and art.\n\nThe influence of so sincere and profound an artist has necessarily\nbeen profound. He has moulded men who have achieved world-wide fame;\nSegantini, for example, would never have risen to the heights he did\nhad the example of Millet not been ever before him. There have been\nmany who, without possessing his genius, have endeavoured to follow\nin his footsteps, but successfully as his imitators have sometimes\ncaught his style, their productions can never live alongside his,\nbecause they lack the real ring of sincerity.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n        a. One bed, or folding cot,\n        b. One oil stove,\n        c. One lamp,\n        d. Enough supplies of all kinds sufficient for six months,\n        e. Pots, pans, kettles, etc.\nIt is needless to say that positions in Manila and Iloilo were now at\na premium.\n\nWas it possible that teachers were to be sent to places where even the\nnecessaries of life could not be obtained! Was it possible that many\nwould be sent to places so remote that for six months no fresh\nsupplies could be gotten! A mass meeting was held at once, and a\ncommittee was appointed to send a cablegram to the Associated Press\npetitioning aid from the American people at large. Realizing what\nconsternation would be created throughout the United States by such a\nmessage, two of the teachers leaped into a carriage at the close of\nthe meeting and a few moments later were closeted with the chief\nexecutive of the department. As a result the committee was persuaded\nnot to send the cablegram to the Associated Press until by courtesy it\nhad been sent to the President. Of course, this diplomatic move tided\naffairs over and the teachers who had flatly refused to budge from\nManila now agreed to go on to their stations, being assured that\nwhatever action was best would be taken.\n\nThe day had come when we must separate. We were to enter an untried\nand an unknown field. It was fitting that we have a final joyous\nmeeting, so the best orchestra in the archipelago was engaged and we\n\"chased the hours with flying feet\" until dawn so that whatever might\ncome to us in that unknown future upon which we were entering each\nwould hold in pleasant memory our last evening together.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER III. - A DRAMA IN ACTUAL LIFE.\n\n\nAlmost every one heeded the warning to go to his station forearmed\nwith at least necessaries of life, but, as it had never fallen to the\nlot of the writer to cook, he refused to learn at that late day, so he\ntook no pot, no pan, no kettle, putting his future into the hands of\nan uncertain fate and relying upon the unknown hospitality of the\nFilipino.\n\nBacalod, the capital of the province of Occidental Negros, was our\ndestination. The second morning after leaving Manila, we awoke with\nthe \"Kilpatrick\" lying at anchor in a shallow bay. We were several\nmiles from the shore and nothing in sight indicated that we had\nreached a place of any importance. Late the night before we had been\nawakened by the loud, sharp ringing of the ship's bells, accompanied\nby the reversal of the engines and a general disturbance awaking the\ncrew. So our first impressions on coming on deck were that we had run\naground. But the captain assured us that everything was ship-shape and\nthat this was the nearest point of approach to Capiz, a town of\nconsiderable importance on the island of Panay, where a body of troops\nwas to embark for home. Not even the grass hut of a native was in\nsight. Search as we would, not a sign was seen of a stream flowing\ninto the sea, indicating the probable presence of a town. There was\nnot a sign of life of any kind save one lone column of thin, blue\nsmoke that arose from the side of a mountain miles away. One would\nhave thought that we were explorers of three hundred years ago lying\noff the shore of some unknown land.\n\nAfter breakfast the steam launch, together with all the boats, was\nlowered, and several of us who had determined to miss no opportunity\nto gather information about the islands took our places in the launch\nby the side of the ship's mate, and steamed away across the water with\na long line of boats strung out in the rear. We headed away toward a\ngroup of cocoanut trees, and about an hour later stepped ashore on a\npile of decayed coral rocks that extended some twenty or thirty feet\nout into the water, thus forming the only landing place of a town of\nseveral thousands of people and of considerable commercial importance.\n\nA few moments after we had landed, an army wagon drawn by a\nmagnificent pair of mules came up out of a tropical jungle along a\nnarrow road. We clambered into the wagon and were soon lost in the\ndepths of foliage from which we had just seen the vehicle emerge.\n\nLong waving bamboos with their plumy leafage hung over the road from\neach side, meeting and overlapping in the center until they formed an\narchway so dense that the tropical sun now high in the heavens\npenetrated it only at intervals. At times the wagon sank up to the\nhubs in the soft earth, and the muscles of the mules stood out like\nwhip-cords under the skin as they drew us forward.\n\nAt a sharp turn in the road we came upon the first division of troops\nthat was to embark for home. The look of joy upon their sun-browned\nfaces was inexpressible. Their work was done, and with elastic step\nand smiling faces they saluted us as they passed by. The reign of\nforce was at an end; it was going out with them; the reign of peace\nhad begun; it was coming in with us.\n\nIn the afternoon when we returned from the town the last of the troops\nhad arrived and, as we drove up, the bugle was sounding the call to\nsupper. We noticed native women mingling with the troops and, indeed,\na native woman was in constant attention waiting upon one of the\nsoldiers with whom we ate. Her clothes were clean, her hair was nicely\ncombed, and her general appearance was neat. She seemed to anticipate\nthe slightest wish of the soldier with whom she was. She brought him\nwater to drink, cleaned his plate after the meal and saw that his\nknife, fork, and spoon were put into his haversack.\n\nWe had now finished supper and the launch had returned for the last\nload of troops. The lieutenant in command of the company gave the\norder to \"fall in\"; the men shouldered their rifles and fell into\nline. \"Forward, march!\" called the lieutenant, and the column swept\nforward towards the boats. The women had until now restrained\nthemselves, but, as their husbands marched away never to return, their\nfeelings could no longer be restrained. One young woman of about\neighteen, who was leaning against a rock by the roadside sobbing, when\nher husband passed, leaped up in frenzy of passionate love and caught\nthe rifle from his shoulder. Her first impulse seemed to be to throw\nthe gun away, but suddenly realizing the futility of such an act she\nburst into tears, shouldered the rifle herself and marched on by his\nside. Another woman of more mature age threw her arms around the legs\nof a tall stalwart man, and drew him bodily from the line.\n\nBut the troops marched on and entered the boats. One woman who had\nbeen unnoticed before came down into the shallow water and caught hold\nof our last boat as if to prevent its leaving, while others stood\nmingling their sobs with the sounds of the wavelets as they broke on\nthe sands. As we passed away, an expectant mother, standing in bold\noutline against the twilight sky, threw up her hands in an agony of\ndespair and then sank upon the stones. The curtain had fallen upon a\ndrama in actual life deeper in pathos than any other we had ever seen\nor ever expected to see. Depth of passion, depth of love! Who can\nfathom the human heart?\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. - WHAT THE TEACHERS DID.\n\n\nThere is a remarkable sameness about the towns in the Philippines.\n\nThey all have a large open square about the middle of the town, around\nthree sides of which are Chinese stores, unless one side lies open to\nthe sea, and on the fourth is the great stone ecclesia. The streets\nrun at right angles to one another and divide up the town into\ncreditable squares.\n\nEverybody in the Philippines lives up-stairs, for the ground is so\nsoaked with water during the rainy season that it is a menace to\nhealth to live upon the ground floor. So even the poorest nippa hut\nis built upon stakes four or five feet above the ground.\n\nBacalod is a typical Philippine town. As we landed, a broad open\nsquare was spread out before us. Two sides of the square were lined\nwith two-story houses in which were Chinese stores below and Filipino\nhomes above. On the third side stood the great stone church in whose\nmassive tower the clock was striking the hour of four, while the\nfourth lay open to the sea that had borne us thither.\n\nWe landed, but it was in a method new to us and one not usually\nemployed by the traveling public.\n\nWhen our sail boat ran aground on the sandy bottom a hundred yards or\nmore from the shore, a crowd of Filipino men who were on the beach\nslowly rolled up their pantaloons and waded out to the rescue,--for\nthe money that was in it. The boat's crew elevated their trousers'\nlegs also and slided down into the water. Each of us then straddled\nthe neck of a Filipino standing in the water and was held by ankles to\nbe steadied while our biped mounts proceeded to the shore.\n\nWe were now on the ground and face to face with the situation. To give\nthe reader an idea of the actual conditions met by the first teachers\nwho went to the Islands, the following is copied from the instructions\ngiven us in Manila:\n    1. There shall be two sessions daily of all schools, and the\n    last hour of the morning session shall be devoted solely to\n    instructing the Filipino teachers.\n\n    2. In cases where teachers are sent to a town in which there\n    is no school-house, they are expected to secure the aid of the\n    people and have one built.\n\n    3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is\n    stopped.\n\n    4. All supplies must be kept under lock and key. In towns\n    where there is no case or box to lock the supplies in, and it\n    is also impossible to get the town council to furnish a case,\n    a requisition may be sent to Manila, and, if an appropriation\n    can be secured, one will be made and sent out.\n\nThus it can be easily seen that we were indeed pioneers. In many\nplaces no school-house was to be found, and in some cases it was even\ndifficult to get the town council to provide a case in which to keep\nthe supplies.\n\nThe work of the teachers was, in short; to \"make the English language\nthe basis of instruction in the public schools.\" On our arrival at\nBacalod two schools were found in progress, for some soldiers had been\ndetailed for the work here previous to our coming. One of these was\nfor boys and the other, for girls. Thus the work here had been in a\nmeasure simplified, but complications that had arisen at Talisay, one\nof the largest and richest towns on the island, demanded a change of\nteachers and the writer was assigned to the place as superintendent.\n\nHere an attempt had been made to start a school but it had failed\nignominiously and a system of education was to be put into operation\nfrom the very start.\n\nThe Filipinos are not strong advocates of co-education, so separate\nschools were to be started for the boys and the girls. The one for the\nboys was gotten well in hand before the one for the girls was\nattempted at all.\n\nA few days after reaching the town and securing a home the\npresidente of the town had it publicly announced that the following\nMonday morning at eight o'clock a public school for boys would be\nopened in a building that had been rented for the purpose by the\nmunicipal council. About the middle of the afternoon of the same day a\nman beat a little drum throughout all the streets of the town to call\nthe people out and the town clerk announced both in Spanish and in the\nnative language that this public school would begin at the time and\nplace mentioned above; that instruction would be free to all who came;\nthat the government would furnish all supplies; and that instruction\nwould be given in the English language. A native principal and\nassistants were employed and everything was ready to begin.\n\nThe official report of the result is as follows:\n    Boys' public school of Talisay, Negros, P. I., began November\n    4, 1901. Forty-three boys present at eight o'clock. Forty-one\n    of them knew \"good morning\" and \"good afternoon\" but do not\n    know the distinction between them. Two of them speak simple\n    Spanish. At eight forty-five, eight more, who had been\n    attending an early morning private school, came in together.\n\n    The books they brought were so varied and so different from\n    one another that it seemed impossible to bring any reasonable\n    degree of order out of such a chaos, and so, after struggling\n    vainly for about a week with the problem, the superintendent\n    by one fell stroke removed everything in use and put in a\n    uniform system, and from that day on the English language has\n    been the basis of instruction in the public schools of\n    Talisay. The work was of necessity very slow at first, but by\n    the end of a year two schools were going nicely and a number\n    of the brightest boys and girls had made really excellent\n    progress.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER V. - A \"BAILE.\"\n\n\nNot long after the arrival of our party at Bacalod we received an\ninvitation to a \"baile\" given in our honor by the inhabitants of\nSilay, a town some ten or twelve miles up the northern coast and one\nnoted for its social life. The invitation was accepted with pleasure,\nand about the middle of the afternoon on the day appointed we were\nclad in the immaculate white of the tropics and steaming away up the\ncoast on board a launch sent for our conveyance. Twilight was still\nlingering on the path of day when we anchored just off shore at the\ntown. A row-boat containing the officials of the city came out to meet\nus and, in due season, we were ushered into a spacious drawing-room\nfilled almost to overflowing with the \u00e9lite of the town. The \u00e9lite of\ntowns in the Philippines speak Spanish, and, as only one or two of our\nparty could at that time boast of more than a formal acquaintance with\nthe Castilian tongue, the exchange of ideas that evening between us\nand the Filipinos was of necessity not very rapid.\n\nThe necessity of easy communication between us was rendered somewhat\nless indispensable by the announcement of supper as soon as we were\nrested from our trip. When we had taken our places at the table a\nyoung Filipino about twenty-five years of age arose and gave a lengthy\ntoast to the recent union of the Philippines with the United States.\n\nBut as we Americans were unable to scale the dizzy heights of his\nclimaxes or sink to the depths of his pathos, we forewent the\npleasures of his oratory and turned our attention to the savory odor\nof lamb, chicken, and roast pig that came slyly stealing up our\nnostrils to send us nerve dispatches about the gastronomic delights of\nour not far distant future.\n\nAt last the toast was ended and the world-wide soup ushered in a long\ntrain of things good to eat, served in a style better fitted to the\ndelights of the appetite than to the formalities of dinners, for, as\nsoon as the pleasant task of one dish was completed by any one, the\nnext was served him at once regardless of the progress made by the\nothers at the table.\n\nThe last course was dulce. The new-comers to the Philippines will\nnot be long in making the acquaintance of this dish, and at all\nmeetings, both public and private, where eatables are served, it\nperforms an important part. It is anything sweet, and it may vary all\nthe way from an india-rubber-like black mixture of cocoanut milk and\ndirty sugar to a really toothsome and respectable confection. No\nmatter of what materials a dish is composed, just so long as it is\nsweet, it is dulce.\n\nAfter paying our respects to this last course, we arose from the table\nand entered a great rectangular room from the center of whose ceiling\nhung a large glass chandelier, a mass of shimmering crystals. In the\nchairs around the room were the wealth, the youth, and the beauty of\nthe town.\n\nThe first and also the last number of every Filipino dance of any\nformality is the \"rigodon.\" The dancers are arranged in a square, or\nquadrangle according to the number participating, and are then led\nthrough a tangled maze of figures that so utterly bewilders the novice\nthat he sinks into his chair at the end of the dance wondering how it\nall came to pass.\n\nWe Americans breathed a sigh of relief when the \"rigodon\" ended, and\nmustered fresh courage for social conquests in the waltz that was now\nbreathing forth from the trembling strings. My companion in the first\ndance had been the young lady by whose side I had sat at dinner. But\nit now became necessary to search for another, so I prudently waited\nto see how partners were chosen, and made no mistake when a few\nmoments later I faced one of the most luscious looking se\u00f1oritas on\nthe opposite side of the room and offered her my arm. My eyes must\nhave told the story that my lips could not utter in Spanish, for she\nsmiled upon me sweetly, arose, and put her hand upon my shoulder. My\narm encircled her waist and I began to waltz. Unfortunately my\ncompanion did not follow, but began to hop up and down in a manner\nmost distressing. Supposing the attack to be only temporary, I paused\nand, much to my relief, she soon showed signs of recovery; and in the\ncourse of time she came to a standstill looking up into my face in an\ninquiring sort of way, apparently wondering why St. Vitus had not paid\nhis respects to me also. A second attempt to follow the music met with\nresults similar to the first, and during the third attempt, which\nseemed to be trembling on the verge of a failure, St. Vitus let go my\ncompanion and seized me with such vigor that she, who was small even\nfor a Filipino, was gathered up bodily and taken around the room at\nsuch a pace that her toes touched the floor only at far distant\nintervals.\n\nAt this point my devotion to the shrine of Terpsichore ceased from\nforce of circumstances and I seated myself in one of the most\ncomfortable chairs in sight that I might carry out a previously formed\nplan to study the Filipino somewhat critically as he appears in\nsociety.\n\nThe first thing that impressed me as the dancers passed up and down\nthe room was the flash of diamonds. Nearly every woman in the room had\non a brooch that flashed the colors of the rainbow at every turn.\n\nAlmost all of them wore one or more rings that showed up brilliantly\nunder the chandelier. Many of the men too, especially the young men,\nwore gems that appeared to be exquisite. A closer inspection showed\nthat some of the gems had flaws and others were of a poor color, but\nno one would have denied that, taken as a whole, it was a really\nbeautiful display.\n\nThe dress of the ladies was richly colored. Many of their skirts were\nof silk covered with hand embroidered flowers, and their filmy pina\nwaists and broad collar pieces were rich with needle-work. They all\nwore a kind of heelless velvet slipper, very common as a dress shoe in\nthe Philippines, or high-heeled patent leather shoes with neatly\nfitting black stockings.\n\nThe men were dressed in white coats and white pantaloons or black\ncoats and white pantaloons. White shirts and collars, together with\nall sorts and styles of cravats and low-cut patent leather shoes with\nhighly colored socks completed their dress.\n\nIt was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money;\nthat they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a\ntable loaded with good things was a fact to which all of us were\nenthusiastic witnesses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VI. - A SKETCH OF LIFE IN THE PHILIPPINES.\n\n\nHouse-keeping in the Philippines presents some interesting phases. Our\nclub of American officials decided to run a mess, so we employed a\ncook and a house boy, then each of us provided himself with a personal\nservant, making a total of six servants for four men--it takes about\nthis proportion of servants to live in any sort of comfort in the\nPhilippines--and launched ourselves boldly upon the sea of domestic\neconomy. But there were shoals ahead of us, for the question of\nregulating servants is one of no small importance in the Philippines,\nand one of its most disadvantageous features is the long chain of\ndependents that usually attends it.\n\nWe gave the cooks so much a day with which to buy supplies in the\nlocal market, for our own table, making him render a daily list of\nexpenditures, and a fixed amount besides to purchase rice and fish for\nhimself and the other servants. Of course, if they wished to vary\ntheir diet and get chicken and fresh pork, which could be had at far\ndistant intervals, it was wholly a matter of their option, but the\nallowance was made on the basis of so much rice and fish a day for\neach. This allowance was about fifteen cents a day in Spanish coin per\nservant.\n\nThus far all was well. We had agreed to give the cook eight dollars a\nmonth in Spanish money, thinking that good wages would procure good\nservice, but the visions of affluence that floated before him on such\nfloods of wealth were so alluring that they drew him from the kitchen\nto the cooler veranda. In less than a week he had employed an\nassistant at four dollars a month; in less than another week that\nassistant had employed him an assistant at two dollars a month; in\nless than another week that assistant to the assistant had employed\nhim an assistant at the princely salary of fifty cents a month; and\nfrom fear that the chain of dependents would end only by our having\nthe whole Filipino race attached to our culinary force, we broke up\nhouse-keeping and went boarding again, choosing that as the less of\nthe two evils.\n\nOur house furnishings were almost wholly Philippine. The table ware\nand the food on the table came from the ends of the earth. The knives\nand forks were made in Germany, the plates were manufactured in\nEngland, the glass ware and table cloth, in the United States. The\noatmeal and flour came from the United States also. The butter came\nfrom Australia, the rice from China, the salt from Russia, and the\nother eatables from sources about as various as their separate names.\n\nSwitzerland furnished the condensed milk and Illinois the canned\ncream. Nearly all of the canned fruit bore labels from Spain.\n\nThus it can easily be seen that life in the Philippines, if lived\naccording to American ideals, is dependent upon a highly developed and\nhighly complex commerce. However, the difficulties of transportation\nand the restriction of large stocks of merchandise to Manila and some\nhalf a dozen other towns, make so great a difference between country\nlife and city life that a short comparison of the two will not be out\nof place, and life in Manila may well be taken as being fairly typical\nof the latter.\n\nLife in Manila is pleasant, but expensive. It is pleasant from the\nfact that it is not only the capital but also metropolis of the\narchipelago. Thus the combination of wealth and high official position\nhas given to Manila a society of the highest and most refined type.\n\nThe process of beautifying and improving the city which is constantly\ngoing on bids fair to give us at no distant day a city of which we may\nwell be proud.\n\nBut let him who intends living well in Manila on a small income bid\nfarewell at once to so idylic a dream, for it costs much to live well\nthere. In the city of Manila one can get almost anything he wishes,\nbut it must be paid for at the price it commands. Especially in the\ncase of eatables, this price is by no means small, because to the\nfirst cost of articles must in most cases be added the expense of\ndistant shipment from American, European, or Australian ports, and not\ninfrequently the cost of long refrigeration must also be taken into\nconsideration. But, expensive though it is, it is very pleasant to\nlive there and those who have once enjoyed it often wish again to\nquaff the cup of its delights.\n\nIn strong contrast to this pleasant life is the life of the quiet\nlittle hamlet away in the distant islands. Indeed, the Filipino from\nthe distant town, who by some good fortune has been to Manila, or, by\na coup de main, has studied in one of the Manila colleges, is looked\nup to in a true hero-worshiping attitude by all who either know him or\nhear of his fame. Life in such a place is one long state of harmless\ninactivity. Not a wave of trouble from the great outer world ever\ndisturbs its peaceful repose. One lounges forever in an air of\nindolent ease and extreme aversion to anything approaching what might\nbe called a respectable effort.\n\nOne arises in the morning about the time the sun's first rays silver\nthe top leaves of the cocoanut trees and then stirs around until nine\nor ten o'clock, when it is found expedient to avoid a further exposure\nto the sun. From then until about five o'clock in the afternoon it is\nbest to take things as they come, even though one of those things be a\nFilipino dinner. But then you may have your vehiclo attached to a\nyoung bull with a ring in his nose and go for a drive. If it is the\ndry season you will probably enjoy the drive unless you object to the\nfrequent clouds of dust swept along by the evening wind. If it is in\nthe rainy season your pleasure will depend to a considerable extent\nupon how wet you get; but, whether the season be wet or dry, your\npleasure will be regulated largely by the state of harmony existing\nbetween the driver and the bull.\n\nIn these quiet secluded nooks successive generations of Filipinos are\nborn, reared, grow old and die in an even chain of events broken only\nby the occasional erection of a new grass house on the identical spot\nwhere its predecessors have stood for ages. The son lives in the house\nof his father, cultivates the same few square feet of soil planted in\nedible roots, climbs the same cocoanut trees, follows the same winding\npath down to the stream, pounds rice in the same mortar and with the\nsame stick that his ancestors have used from time unremembered, and,\nin case of illness, curls up on a grass mat in a corner of the room\nuntil he dies or by some good fortune recovers. Beyond this narrow\nhorizon he never looks. So narrow and contracted is the life that the\nlanguages of two towns a few miles apart are so different that one\nwould scarcely recognize them as belonging to the same race of people.\n\nSuch are the two extremes of life in our new far Eastern provinces:\nthe one is active, progressive, and cosmopolitan; the other, inactive,\ndecadent, and narrow; but, whether one enjoys the first or endures the\nsecond, there comes to him after leaving a longing to lounge again in\ntropic airs and listen to the lullaby of the winds among the palms.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VII. - THE FILIPINO AT HOME.\n\n\nAs one enters a Filipino sitting-room for the first time, there is one\nfeature in the arrangement of the furniture that impresses itself upon\nhim at once, and it may be stated without fear of serious\ncontradiction that this same peculiar feature in its arrangement will\ncontinue to face him, as he enters different homes, about as certainly\nas he crosses the threshold.\n\nThe arrangement referred to is that of one large mirror, one settee,\nand some ten or a dozen chairs that appear to have had a certain\norderly affection for one another. The mirror is hung upon one of the\nlarge interior parts of the house about four feet above the floor. The\nwooden houses in the Philippines are built by setting large posts\nupright into the ground, extending into the air from twenty to thirty\nfeet. Cross timbers are fastened to these upright posts about eight or\nten feet above the ground and then not sawed off even with the posts,\nbut allowed to extend beyond them each way. The framework of the house\nis built upon these extending cross timbers, a style of building by\nwhich these large upright posts are left standing out on the inside of\nthe room from one to three feet from the walls. It is on that one of\nthese posts most nearly opposite the door that the mirror always finds\nits place. Immediately beneath the mirror is the settee; and the\nchairs are arranged in two parallel lines facing one another and at\nright angles with the ends of the settee. However odd this arrangement\nmay appear to one when he first enters a Filipino drawing-room, there\nare two things to be said in its favor. In the first place, it places\nyou face to face with the person with whom you are conversing so that\nyou can watch him,--a matter of no small moment in the Philippines. In\nthe next place, it enables you to give one of the young ladies a\nsheep's-eye in the mirror while the others present are left where\nMoses was in our much abused conundrum.\n\nThe size of the residence and the quality of its furnishings depends\nupon the wealth of the owner. But there is so vast a difference\nbetween the mode of life of the highest class and the tao, or lowest\nclass, that it is well to speak of them separately, and the great\nmiddle class of Filipinos can easily be imagined to occupy the\nintervening ground.\n\nThe rich Filipino's house is usually of wood built upon a wall of\nstone or brick from ten to fifteen feet high. The floors are kept\nhighly polished in his hallway, dressing-room, and bed-rooms. There\nare, of course, no fire-places in any of the rooms, but on some\noccasions something is needed to dry the rain-soaked atmosphere, for\neven in the dry season it has been seen to rain for five successive\ndays and nights without the cessation of a moment.\n\nA long chain of dependents is attached to the household of the rich\nFilipino. The master has his special body servant to be present at all\ntimes to do his master's bidding, in short, to be the visible\nmechanism of his master's volition. So, too, the lady of the house has\nher servant woman to do the slightest bidding of her ladyship. Then\nthere is the cook who is almost invariably a man, a house boy or two,\nand the coachman. These functionaries, with their assistants and\nassistants to the assistants, together with a servant or two for the\nexclusive service of the children, complete the economic household.\n\nSuch a family has an abundance of rice and wheat bread, also of\nchicken and fish with occasional fresh beef. They have also a good\ndeal of dulce. They regularly serve wine and frequently serve beer\non their tables.\n\nIn strong contrast with this mode of life is that of the tao. His\ndiet consists almost wholly of rice and small uncleaned fish boiled\ntogether. As a rule knife, fork, plate, and spoon find no place in his\nhousehold. The rice and fish are boiled in a pot and then allowed to\ncool in the same vessel or poured out to cool in a large earthen or\nwooden bowl. Then Mr. Tao together with Mrs. Tao and all the young\nTaos squat on their heels around the mixture and satisfy that\nintangible thing called the appetite. They do not use chop sticks as\nthe Chinese do, but the rice and fish are caught in a hollow formed by\nthe first three fingers of the right hand. The thumb is then placed\nbehind the mass. It is raised up and poised before the mouth, with a\nskill coming from the evolution of ages, when a contraction of the\nmuscles of the thumb throws the mass into the mouth with a skill that\nis marvelous to any but a Filipino. To judge from the most reliable\ninformation, the poorest class do not have an abundance of food,\nalthough it would seem that such a condition of things would be\nwell-nigh impossible. However, in a census of one hundred school\nchildren there were found six boys and four girls who declared that\nthey had never had enough to eat, and the native teacher stated that\nthis was probably true.\n\nThe wide gulf between the tao and the rich man is filled by the\ngreat middle class of Filipinos.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VIII. - VISIT TO A LEPER COLONY.\n\n\nNot far from our town was a leper colony and the first Saturday that\ncould be spared was set aside for a trip to the place. It happened\nthat none of the other Americans were at leisure on this particular\nmorning, but, rather then delay the trip or miss it altogether, the\nwriter, armed with a revolver, started out alone.\n\nThe road had been described so accurately by one who was supposed to\nknow it that it was deemed well-nigh impossible to miss the way. The\nmain highway was followed to the point where the by-path supposed to\nlead to the settlement turned off through some bamboo thickets and a\nlow tropical wood. This path led straight away towards the sea-coast\nwhere the houses of the colony were said to stand in a cocoanut grove\nby the beach.\n\nUpon arriving at the settlement, a very inhospitable reception was\nreceived from a mangy cur that growled and showed a very uninviting\nset of sharp, white teeth behind his snarling lips. The growling of\nthe dog had attracted the attention of an old man who, with age-bent\nback, was pounding rice in a mortar about fifty yards away. He turned\nslowly around and, upon seeing an intruder into the primitive quiet of\nthe place, gave a sharp, far-reaching call. The sound had scarcely\nrung through the grove when from about a dozen of the little grass\nhouses dotted here and there fifteen or twenty men armed with bolos\ncame out and gathered around the old man. A sense of my danger flashed\nupon me. Three miles from town and alone in a tropical jungle, I could\nbe almost instantly overcome by this band of bolo-men, and the only\nreport that would ever reach my people would be that I had\n\"disappeared.\" Of course, attack was by no means certain, but the\npotentiality of the situation was thrilling. A drawn revolver and the\ngleaming of its shining barrel had the effect of stopping the men, who\nseemed to be hesitating as to a course of action, until a somewhat\ndignified retreat was made to an open space in the rear from where a\nless dignified and a more hasty retreat began which did not stop short\nof Bacalod.\n\nEnough had been seen, however, even in this short visit, to give\nconvincing proof that the settlement visited was no colony of lepers;\nso, that afternoon two servant boys being taken as guides and\ninterpreters, another attempt was made to reach the goal desired.\n\nThis attempt was successful, and, after about two hours of walking, a\nlittle cluster of grass huts snugly hidden by the sea-coast came into\nview. As we approached, one would have thought it a gala-day. Some few\nchildren, apparently from six to thirteen years of age, almost wholly\nnude, were romping and playing in the open space around which the huts\nstood, and no one would ever have thought that any cloud so horrible\nas leprosy could hover over a place apparently so happy.\n\nBy the side of the path as we passed was a man and his wife setting\nout potato plants. His hands were so puffed and his fingers so short\nthat he could scarcely use them, but he was working along as best he\ncould. His wife's feet were so swollen and twisted that she walked\nonly with the greatest difficulty. We passed them by and entered the\nopen space above referred to.\n\nThe children now saw us, and those of them who could darted away like\nfrightened rabbits, each to his own burrow. An old man who was sitting\nin the warm afternoon sun on the little bamboo platform before his hut\nwas aroused from his lethargic repose by the scampering away of the\nchildren. He arose, trembling upon his tottering limbs, all drawn and\ntwisted, and hobbled away into his hut.\n\nThe children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at\nthe doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of\nthe settlement. In a few moments we were surrounded by a circle of\nhuman beings at once so repulsive and so pitiable that its graphic\nvividness can never be accurately portrayed.\n\nThe old man referred to above, having put on a pair of snow-white\npantaloons, appeared now at the doorway of his hut, followed a few\nmoments later by his wife who had evidently clothed herself in the\nbest raiment she had. At a call from the old man, all the men, women,\nand children in the settlement came out of their huts and stood in a\nline before us. The old man was spokesman and in his native visayan\ntongue made a heart-rending appeal for aid which we were powerless to\ngive. Attention was called to a leper woman, apparently about\ntwenty-five years of age, whose face had been attacked by the disease\nand whose appearance was truly pathetic. Upon her hip was a child\nabout a year and a half old and, strange to say, the child showed as\nyet no signs whatever of the disease.\n\nWhat an indissoluble enigma is life! Here in a little cluster of grass\nhuts in a secluded nook of a secluded island of an all but secluded\narchipelago was gathered together a little community of wretched\nnatives, driven by their loathsomeness from association with others\neven of the same half-savage race. Yet here, men and women loved and\nwere married, by mutual trust if not by law, and children were born of\nthe union to live forever under the unspeakable horror that\novershadowed the unfortunate parents. Love, hatred, sorrow, and\njoy--every passion that enters into the complex structure of the human\nheart even here, in this scene of sadness and despair, was playing\napparently as freely as where misfortune and disease had never crossed\nthe portals of life.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER IX. - A \"HIKE.\"\n\n\nWe were lounging lazily in our hammocks at Jimamaylan one evening in\nApril. Supper was just ended, and the soldiers in the post were\ncollected in groups here and there spinning yarns to pass away the\ntime, when a Filipino clad only in a loin cloth came down the street\nat a steadily swinging run and stopped in front of the sentry. He\nbrought the announcement that a band of ladrones had just burned a\nsugar mill and were advancing to sack a barrio about fifteen miles\naway.\n\nThe invitation of the commanding officer to go on a \"hike\" was eagerly\naccepted, and, in ten minutes after the message was given, the troops\nwere on the march followed by two adventurous pedagogues.\n\nDarkness was just closing in as we left the town, but a resplendent\ntropic moon soon made the night almost as brilliant as the day. The\ntrail we followed led over rough and rocky country. Sometimes for a\ndistance of a mile or more we passed over barren wastes of volcanic\nslag poured out in anger by some peak whose convulsions have long\nsince ceased. Again we would descend into a tropical jungle from the\ndense foliage of which the ladrones could have leaped at any moment,\nhad they known of our coming, and annihilated our little band. We\nforded rapid streams with the water at our breasts, and halted only\nonce in that rapid march of fifteen miles.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the town we met a man who was standing\nguard against a surprise by the ladrones. Nothing could well have been\nmuch more grotesque and nothing could much better illustrate the\nabsolutely primitive condition of the Filipinos in the interior of the\nislands than the appearance of this guard. A pair of knee pants, a\nconical grass hat, and a hemp shirt formed his entire apparel. A long\nflat wooden shield, a bolo, and a long bamboo spear with a sharp,\nflat, iron point, completed his equipment for battle.\n\nHere stood the first and the twentieth centuries side by side. The\nFilipino who had advanced only a stage beyond the condition of\nprimitive man with his knife, spear, and wooden shield, stood side by\nside with the American soldier, a representative of modern life with\nhis magazine rifle, his canteen, his knapsack,--with every article of\nhis clothing made to give him the highest possible efficiency as the\nunit of a military organization.\n\nA few yards farther on we met another guard equipped similarly to the\nfirst. Upon reaching the town, news had just been received that a\ndetachment of troops from another post had intercepted the ladrones\nand fought a skirmish with them. The ladrones had escaped and we set\nout in pursuit of them on a chase wilder than a Quixotic dream. We\nwound our way into the mountains behind the town, inquiring at every\ngrass hut we passed whether the band of ladrones had passed that way,\nbut only once was even a trace of them found. Then it was learned that\nat a certain place they had separated into groups of three or four and\ngone glimmering through the dream of things that were. This place was\nin a secluded nook of the mountains where in years gone by some\nadventurous Spaniard had erected a primitive water mill to grind his\nsugar-cane. We had now marched about twenty miles and the feet of the\npedagogues were a mass of blisters. They had reached the point where\nthat form of military maneuvering called \"hiking\" ceased to possess\nany alluring charms. So a native was persuaded to come out of his lone\nmountain hut and hitch up his carabao and cart. He was then made to\nget on the carabao's back, while the aforesaid pedagogues lay down on\nthe sugar-cane pulp that had been put into the body of the cart, and\nthe driver was instructed to start for the post we had left hours\nbefore, and not to stop until he got there. Being uncertain but that\nsome of the ladrones would learn of our having left the body of troops\nand would try the metal of our steel, we at first agreed that neither\nof us should go to sleep, but it was later decided that probably the\ndriver had no greater desire to cross the Styx than his passengers had\nand that in case of danger he would awaken us, so both took a revolver\nin each hand, stretched out supinely and went to sleep.\n\nSuch a sleep! The rough jolting of the cart over an almost impassable\nroad was never enough to break the spell of slumber. When we awoke the\nblazing tropic sun was past the midday mark of morning, shining full\ninto our unprotected and well-nigh blistered faces.\n\nA pack of dogs were heralding our approach to a little village at the\nfoot of the mountains where ponies were procured to take us back to\nthe post."

                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently\nno time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth dimension of Space\nas a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house\nbecame quite quiet.\n\nOn reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up\nagainst a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realize\nhis position. Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\nhundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the\nDowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone\ninto hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains on\none of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who\nhad been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr\nto nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair\nby the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six\nweeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become\nreconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that\nnotorious sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible\nnight when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his\ndressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and\nconfessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox\nout of \u00a350,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card, and swore that\nthe ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back\nto him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because\nhe had seen a green hand tapping at the window-pane, to the beautiful\nLady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round\nher throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin,\nand who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of the\nKing's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he went\nover his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as\nhe recalled to mind his last appearance as \"Red Reuben, or the Strangled\nBabe,\" his d\u00e9but as \"Guant Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,\"\n\nand the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely\nplaying ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And\nafter all this some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him\nthe Rising Sun Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite\nunbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever been treated in this\nmanner. Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance, and remained till\ndaylight in an attitude of deep thought.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III\n\n\nThe next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed\nthe ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. \"I have\nno wish,\" he said, \"to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say\nthat, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,\"--a very just remark,\nat which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.\n\n\"Upon the other hand,\" he continued, \"if he really declines to use the\nRising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him. It\nwould be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside\nthe bedrooms.\"\n\nFor the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the\nblood-stain on the library floor. This certainly was very strange, as\nthe door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept\nclosely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a\ngood deal of comment. Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red,\nthen it would be vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came\ndown for family prayers, according to the simple rites of the Free\nAmerican Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright\nemerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party\nvery much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening. The\nonly person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia, who,\nfor some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the\nsight of the blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was\nemerald-green.\n\nThe second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in\nthe hall. Rushing down-stairs, they found that a large suit of old\narmour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone\nfloor, while seated in a high-backed chair was the Canterville ghost,\nrubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face. The\ntwins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged\ntwo pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained\nby long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United\nStates Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in\naccordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost\nstarted up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a\nmist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so\nleaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase\nhe recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of\ndemoniac laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely\nuseful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single\nnight, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French\ngovernesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly\nlaughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and\nrang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door\nopened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown. \"I am\nafraid you are far from well,\" she said, \"and have brought you a bottle\nof Doctor Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a\nmost excellent remedy.\" The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at\nonce to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an\naccomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family\ndoctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's\nuncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps,\nhowever, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself\nwith becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep\nchurchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.\n\nOn reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the\nmost violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross\nmaterialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what\nreally distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit\nof mail. He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by\nthe sight of a Spectre in armour, if for no more sensible reason, at\nleast out of respect for their natural poet Longfellow, over whose\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\nhour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides it was his own suit.\n\nHe had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament, and had\nbeen highly complimented on it by no less a person than the Virgin Queen\nherself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely overpowered\nby the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen\nheavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees severely, and\nbruising the knuckles of his right hand.\n\nFor some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of\nhis room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.\n\nHowever, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to\nmake a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his\nfamily. He selected Friday, August 17th, for his appearance, and spent\nmost of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in\nfavour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet\nfrilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards evening a\nviolent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was\njust such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to\nmake his way quietly to Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the\nfoot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\nof low music. He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville\nblood-stain by means of Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent. Having reduced\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and\nhis wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead,\nwhile he hissed into her trembling husband's ear the awful secrets of\nthe charnel-house. With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made\nup his mind. She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and\ngentle. A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more\nthan sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the\ncounterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins, he was quite\ndetermined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be done was, of\ncourse, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling\nsensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each\nother, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse,\ntill they became paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw off the\nwinding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white, bleached bones and\none rolling eyeball, in the character of \"Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's\nSkeleton,\" a r\u00f4le in which he had on more than one occasion produced a\ngreat effect, and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of\n\"Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.\"\n\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the\nlight-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves\nbefore they retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still,\nand, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the\nwindow-panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family\nslept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\ncould hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States. He\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his\nmurdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like\nan evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.\n\nOnce he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only\nthe baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange\nsixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\nin the midnight air. Finally he reached the corner of the passage that\nled to luckless Washington's room. For a moment he paused there, the\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's\nshroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was\ncome. He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had\nhe done so than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid\nhis blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was\nstanding a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous\nas a madman's dream! Its head was bald and burnished; its face round,\nand fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\nfeatures into an eternal grin. From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\nlight, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like\nto his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form. On its breast\nwas a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of\nshame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime,\nand, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\n\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's\njack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler. Once in the\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small\npallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes. After a time, however,\nthe brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to\ngo and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight. Accordingly,\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling\nthat, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid\nof his new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins. On reaching\nthe spot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had\nevidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from\nits hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it\nwas leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable\nattitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his\nhorror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a\nrecumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity\nbed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow\nturnip lying at his feet! Unable to understand this curious\ntransformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there,\nin the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:--\n        +------------------------------------+\n        |         YE OTIS GHOSTE             |\n        | Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook, |\n        |    Beware of Ye Imitationes.       |\n        |   All others are counterfeite.     |\n        +------------------------------------+\nThe whole thing flashed across him. He had been tricked, foiled, and\nout-witted! The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his\ntoothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his\nhead, swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\nschool, that, when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds\nof blood would be wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.\n\nHardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of\na distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh,\nand waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\nreason, did not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back\nto his room, thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose. There he\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was\nexceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which this oath\nhad been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second time. \"Perdition\nseize the naughty fowl,\" he muttered, \"I have seen the day when, with my\nstout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow\nfor me an 'twere in death!\" He then retired to a comfortable lead\ncoffin, and stayed there till evening.\n\n\nCHAPTER: IV\n\n\nThe next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were\ncompletely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five\ndays he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point\nof the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want\nit, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a\nlow, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating\nthe symbolic value of sensuous phenomena. The question of phantasmic\napparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a\ndifferent matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large\noriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every month, and he\ndid not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is\nquite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand,\nhe was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.\n\nFor the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as\nusual between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible\nprecaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots,\ntrod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large\nblack velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for\noiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good\ndeal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of\nprotection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he\nslipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a\nlittle humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see\nthat there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a\ncertain degree, it served his purpose. Still in spite of everything he\nwas not left unmolested. Strings were continually being stretched across\nthe corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion,\nwhile dressed for the part of \"Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley\nWoods,\" he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide,\nwhich the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry\nChamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged\nhim, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and\nsocial position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the\nnext night in his celebrated character of \"Reckless Rupert, or the\nHeadless Earl.\"\n\nHe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in\nfact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means\nof it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord\nCanterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome\nJack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\ndown the terrace at twilight. Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\nLord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken\nheart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it\nhad been a great success. It was, however an extremely difficult\n\"make-up,\" if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more\nscientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three\nhours to make his preparations. At last everything was ready, and he was\nvery pleased with his appearance. The big leather riding-boots that went\nwith the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\nfind one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite\nsatisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting\nand crept down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins,\nwhich I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of\nthe colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make\nan effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water\nfell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his\nleft shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed. The shock to his\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\ncould go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold. The only\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\nhad not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences\nmight have been very serious.\n\nHe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,\nand contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in\nlist slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\ndraughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the\ntwins. The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September. He\nhad gone down-stairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that\nthere, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing\nhimself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of\nthe United States Minister and his wife which had now taken the place of\nthe Canterville family pictures. He was simply but neatly clad in a long\nshroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip\nof yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In\nfact, he was dressed for the character of \"Jonas the Graveless, or the\nCorpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,\" one of his most remarkable\nimpersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to\nremember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their\nneighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a quarter-past two o'clock in\nthe morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring. As\nhe was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any\ntraces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a\ndark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads,\nand shrieked out \"BOO!\" in his ear.\n\nSeized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural,\nhe rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him\nthere with the big garden-syringe, and being thus hemmed in by his\nenemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the\ngreat iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to\nmake his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own\nroom in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.\n\nAfter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins\nlay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\nservants, but it was of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings\nwere so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed\nhis great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had\nbeen engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized a wonderful\nclam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse\neuchre, poker, and other American national games, and Virginia rode\nabout the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire,\nwho had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville\nChase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in\nfact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who,\nin reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best\ncongratulations to the Minister's worthy wife.\n\nThe Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the\nhouse, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let\nmatters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the\nyoung Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had\nonce bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice\nwith the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the\nfloor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state that, though\nhe lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but\n\"Double Sixes.\" The story was well known at the time, though, of course,\nout of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt\nwas made to hush it up, and a full account of all the circumstances\nconnected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle's\nRecollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends. The ghost, then,\nwas naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence\nover the Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his\nown first cousin having been married en secondes noces to the Sieur de\nBulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are\nlineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to\nVirginia's little lover in his celebrated impersonation of \"The Vampire\nMonk, or the Bloodless Benedictine,\" a performance so horrible that when\nold Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in\nthe year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which\nculminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after\ndisinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and\nleaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment,\nhowever, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the\nlittle Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal\nBedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.\n\n\nCHAPTER: V\n\n\nA few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out\nriding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting\nthrough a hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go\nup by the back staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past\nthe Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied\nshe saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother's maid, who\nsometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend\nher habit. To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville\nGhost himself! He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of\nthe yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing\nmadly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his hand, and his\nwhole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so forlorn, and so\nmuch out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea\nhad been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity,\nand determined to try and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so\ndeep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she\nspoke to him.\n\n\"I am so sorry for you,\" she said, \"but my brothers are going back to\nEton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy\nyou.\"\n\n\"It is absurd asking me to behave myself,\" he answered, looking round in\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,\n\"quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and\nwalk about at night, if that is what you mean. It is my only reason for\nexisting.\"\n\n\"It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very\nwicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had\nkilled your wife.\"\n\n\"Well, I quite admit it,\" said the Ghost, petulantly, \"but it was a\npurely family matter, and concerned no one else.\"\n\n\"It is very wrong to kill any one,\" said Virginia, who at times had a\nsweet puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.\n\n\"Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very\nplain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about\ncookery. Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent\npricket, and do you know how she had it sent to table? However, it is\nno matter now, for it is all over, and I don't think it was very nice of\nher brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.\"\n\n\"Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost--I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry? I\nhave a sandwich in my case. Would you like it?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you,\nall the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\nvulgar, dishonest family.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Virginia, stamping her foot, \"it is you who are rude, and\nhorrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the\npaints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain\nin the library. First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and\nI couldn't do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the\nchrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese\nwhite, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing\nto look at, and not at all easy to paint. I never told on you, though I\nwas very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for\nwho ever heard of emerald-green blood?\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" said the Ghost, rather meekly, \"what was I to do? It is\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother\nbegan it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I\nshould not have your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of\ntaste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest\nin England; but I know you Americans don't care for things of this\nkind.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\nand improve your mind. My father will be only too happy to give you a\nfree passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind,\nthere will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are\nall Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\nhave a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family ghost.\"\n\n\"I don't think I should like America.\"\n\n\"I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,\" said Virginia,\nsatirically.\n\n\"No ruins! no curiosities!\" answered the Ghost; \"you have your navy and\nyour manners.\"\n\n\"Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week's\nholiday.\"\n\n\"Please don't go, Miss Virginia,\" he cried; \"I am so lonely and so\nunhappy, and I really don't know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I\ncannot.\"\n\n\"That's quite absurd! You have merely to go to bed and blow out the\ncandle. It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\nchurch, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why, even\nbabies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.\"\n\n\"I have not slept for three hundred years,\" he said sadly, and\nVirginia's beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; \"for three hundred\nyears I have not slept, and I am so tired.\"\n\nVirginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like\nrose-leaves. She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked\nup into his old withered face.\n\n\"Poor, poor Ghost,\" she murmured; \"have you no place where you can\nsleep?\"\n\n\"Far away beyond the pine-woods,\" he answered, in a low, dreamy voice,\n\"there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\nsings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold crystal\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\nsleepers.\"\n\nVirginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\n\n\"You mean the Garden of Death,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth,\nwith the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have\nno yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at\npeace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of death's\nhouse, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death\nis.\"\n\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\nthere was silence. She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\n\nThen the ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of\nthe wind.\n\n\"Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?\"\n\n\"Oh, often,\" cried the little girl, looking up; \"I know it quite well.\n\nIt is painted in curious black letters, and is difficult to read. There\nare only six lines:\n    \"'When a golden girl can win\n    Prayer from out the lips of sin,\n    When the barren almond bears,\n    And a little child gives away its tears,\n    Then shall all the house be still\n    And peace come to Canterville.'\n\n\"But I don't know what they mean.\"\n\n\"They mean,\" he said, sadly, \"that you must weep with me for my sins,\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle,\nthe angel of death will have mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\ncannot prevail.\"\n\nVirginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair\nas he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes. \"I am not afraid,\" she said\nfirmly, \"and I will ask the angel to have mercy on you.\"\n\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as\nhe led her across the dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were\nbroidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back. \"Go back! little Virginia,\"\n\nthey cried, \"go back!\" but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly,\nand she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails\nand goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and\nmurmured, \"Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,\"\n\nbut the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When\nthey reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she\ncould not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly\nfading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A\nbitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her\ndress. \"Quick, quick,\" cried the Ghost, \"or it will be too late,\" and\nin a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry\nChamber was empty.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VI\n\n\nAbout ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not\ncome down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia\nanywhere. As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\nevening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all\nalarmed at first, but when six o'clock struck, and Virginia did not\nappear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for\nher, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house. At\nhalf-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\nof their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of\nexcitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly\nremembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies\npermission to camp in the park. He accordingly at once set off for\nBlackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son\nand two of the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire, who was\nperfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too,\nbut Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a\nscuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gipsies had\ngone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as\nthe fire was still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.\n\nHaving sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran\nhome, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the\ncounty, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been\nkidnapped by tramps or gipsies. He then ordered his horse to be brought\nround, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down\nto dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with a groom. He had hardly,\nhowever, gone a couple of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after\nhim, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with\nhis face very flushed, and no hat. \"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,\" gasped\nout the boy, \"but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.\n\nPlease don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year,\nthere would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me back,\nwill you? I can't go! I won't go!\"\n\nThe Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace,\nand was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down\nfrom his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, \"Well,\nCecil, if you won't go back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must\nget you a hat at Ascot.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!\" cried the little Duke, laughing,\nand they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of\nthe station-master if any one answering to the description of Virginia\nhad been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her. The\nstation-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him\nthat a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a\nhat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his\nshutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away,\nwhich he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as there was a\nlarge common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman, but\ncould get no information from him, and, after riding all over the\ncommon, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase\nabout eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found\nWashington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with\nlanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest trace of\nVirginia had been discovered. The gipsies had been caught on Brockley\nmeadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they should be late. Indeed, they had\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's disappearance, as they\nwere very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his\npark, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search.\n\nThe carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone\nover, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any\nrate, Virginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest\ndepression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they\nfound a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\nwas poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and\nhaving her forehead bathed with eau de cologne by the old housekeeper.\n\nMr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up\nsupper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one\nspoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very\nfond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the\nentreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that\nnothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in\nthe morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down\nimmediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight\nbegan to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded\nthey heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder\nshook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a\npanel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out\non the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her\nhand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs.\nOtis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with\nviolent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.\n\n\"Good heavens! child, where have you been?\" said Mr. Otis, rather\nangrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them.\n\n\"Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and\nyour mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these\npractical jokes any more.\"\n\n\"Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!\" shrieked the twins, as they\ncapered about.\n\n\"My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side\nagain,\" murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair.\n\n\"Papa,\" said Virginia, quietly, \"I have been with the Ghost. He is dead,\nand you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was\nreally sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of\nbeautiful jewels before he died.\"\n\nThe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave\nand serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a\nlighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they\ncame to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia\ntouched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves\nin a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated\nwindow. Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was\na gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone\nfloor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers\nan old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its\nreach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was\ncovered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but\na pile of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding\nher little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the\nparty looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\ndisclosed to them.\n\n\"Hallo!\" suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out\nof the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\nsituated. \"Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.\"\n\n\"God has forgiven him,\" said Virginia, gravely, as she rose to her feet,\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.\n\n\"What an angel you are!\" cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round\nher neck, and kissed her.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VII\n\n\nFour days after these curious incidents, a funeral started from\nCanterville Chase at about eleven o'clock at night. The hearse was drawn\nby eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\nnodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\npurple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville\ncoat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\nservants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully\nimpressive. Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up\nspecially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first\ncarriage along with little Virginia. Then came the United States\nMinister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the\nlast carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had\nbeen frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she\nhad a right to see the last of him. A deep grave had been dug in the\ncorner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service\nwas read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, the servants, according to an old custom\nobserved in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as\nthe coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward,\nand laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms. As\nshe did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its\nsilent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a\nnightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of the\nGarden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a\nword during the drive home.\n\nThe next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given\nto Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby\nnecklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen\nof sixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis\nfelt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"I know that in this country mortmain is held to\napply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that\nthese jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg\nyou, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you\nunder certain strange conditions. As for my daughter, she is merely a\nchild, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such\nappurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I\nmay say, is no mean authority upon Art,--having had the privilege of\nspending several winters in Boston when she was a girl,--that these gems\nare of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\nprice. Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you\nwill recognize how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\nin the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such\nvain gauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\nBritish aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who\nhave been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles\nof Republican simplicity. Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box, as a memento of\nyour unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is extremely old, and\nconsequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to\ncomply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good deal\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with medi\u00e6valism\nin any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was\nborn in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned\nfrom a trip to Athens.\"\n\nLord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister's speech,\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile,\nand when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\nsaid: \"My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky\nancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are\nmuch indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck. The jewels\nare clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough\nto take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave\nin a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. As for their being\nheirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or\nlegal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite\nunknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and\nwhen Miss Virginia grows up, I dare say she will be pleased to have\npretty things to wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the\nfurniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to\nthe ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity\nSir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he\nwas really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase.\"\n\nMr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville's refusal, and\nbegged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was\nquite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to\nretain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of\n1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's first\ndrawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the\nuniversal theme of admiration. For Virginia received the coronet, which\nis the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her\nboy-lover as soon as he came of age. They were both so charming, and\nthey loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the\nmatch, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch\nthe Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less\nthan three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to\nsay, Mr. Otis himself. Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke\npersonally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his\nown words, \"was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating\ninfluences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of\nRepublican simplicity should be forgotten.\" His objections, however,\nwere completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the\naisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his\narm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of\nEngland.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to\nCanterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over\nin the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods. There had\nbeen a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir\nSimon's tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it\nsimply the initials of the old gentleman's name, and the verse from the\nlibrary window. The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses,\nwhich she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for\nsome time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There\nthe Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her\nfeet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly\nhe threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her,\n\"Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.\"\n\n\"Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have,\" he answered, smiling, \"you have never told me what\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.\"\n\n\"I have never told any one, Cecil,\" said Virginia, gravely.\n\n\"I know that, but you might tell me.\"\n\n\"Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you. Poor Sir Simon! I owe\nhim a great deal. Yes, don't laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see\nwhat Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than\nboth.\"\n\nThe Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.\n\n\"You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,\" he murmured.\n\n\"You have always had that, Cecil.\"\n\n\"And you will tell our children some day, won't you?\"\n\nVirginia blushed.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.\n\nYet Millet would have us understand that in spite of this, the\nshepherd is performing a duty to humanity not to be underrated. The\nsheep he has so carefully and conscientiously reared will form food\nto-morrow for many a hungry town-dweller. Further, he would have us\nfollow the peasant as he closes the pen for the night and traces his\ntired steps towards his simple home in the village. The frugal and\nhard-earned meal, prepared for him by his wife, who like himself has\nhad her share of duties to occupy her during the day, is partaken of\nsurrounded by a hungry and joyous group of children. Such themes\nsuggested by the simplicity of his own life appealed to him with\nirresistible force, and it is in their portrayal that his greatness is\nmanifested.\n\nPerhaps no season of the year presented the same attraction for Millet\nas the spring. The period when all the earth after its long winter\nsleep is about to waken into new life seems to have always been a\nsource of inspiration to him. In \"The Sower\" he emphasises the fact\nthat the fruits of the harvest are not to be had without due labour\nbeing expended upon the earth. The sloping field, barren of\nvegetation, and crowned at the top with a small clump of trees, is\nbeing broken up by the distant plough drawn by two horses and guided\nby a peasant. The latter figure is one of the noblest of Millet's\ncreations. By his strained and ever-attentive attitude, by his\ncontinuous tramp over the rough and broken ground, he shows us the\nmonotony of his toil. He crosses the field in one direction, only to\nreturn at an interval of a few feet. In the foreground we have the\nsower, a middle-aged man of typical peasant type, on whose left side a\nbag of seeds is slung. With automatic precision he withdraws a\nhandful, and strews it into the furrows open to receive it. So long as\nhe continues in the same track his labour will be well performed, and\nhence his task is just as monotonous as that of his fellow-worker\nhigher up in the field. The silhouetting of these two figures against\nthe light is symbolical of the labour to be expended in life before\nresults are forthcoming.\n\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that in considering the works of\nMillet, one must not judge him from the standpoint of a mere painter.\n\nHis brush is only the means to an end, and by its means he is enabled\nto bring the fruits of his philosophic observation before us in\npermanent form. It has been charged against the \"Angelus\" that it was\nnot a remarkably fine piece of painting, that many a young artist of\nthe present generation is infinitely better equipped, technically\nspeaking, than the master who wrought this celebrated canvas. This may\nin a measure be true, but it must never be forgotten that Millet\nbrought into play exactly the means which could illustrate his meaning\nin the clearest terms. He had not intended, in painting such a\npicture, to produce a work which would astonish his fellow artists\nwith its brilliancy of handling or magnificence of colour. He wanted\nto make the beholder forget the painter and absorb the lesson. This\nquality runs right through the art of Millet, and it is from this\nstandpoint that we are obliged to weigh his merits.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE\n\n\nJean Fran\u00e7ois Millet was born on October 4, 1814, that is at the\nperiod when French art, at any rate as far as landscape painting is\nconcerned, had reached its lowest ebb. Throughout the eighteenth\ncentury the landscape painter had been hard put to make a living. The\ntaste of connoisseurs throughout the century had been for portraits\nand interiors, or for those numerous pastoral subjects which were\ncarried out with so much decorative charm by such men as Watteau and\nBoucher. Such landscape painting as existed was of the type\npopularised by Vernet; it was built upon a curious mixture of Italian\ninfluence coming from Panini and Salvator Rosa. The only evidence of\nrevolt against such a state of affairs we find in the works of Hubert\nRobert and Moreau. These two, and more especially would I direct the\nreader's attention to the latter, struggled hard to break down the\nconventionalities of the time. They endeavoured to infuse some sense\nof atmosphere into their pictures, and whilst frequently their trees\nand figures are painfully formal, they yet stand alone in the French\nschool as the pioneers of a phase of art which was to attain its\nzenith in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBut after the Revolution, and during the whole of the time that France\nwas under the domination of Napoleon, very rigid principles indeed\nwere enforced with regard to the direction that art should take. The\ninnovation which had its commencement in the reign of Louis XVI. swept\neverything before it as it gained force. Classical art and traditions\ndominated the whole French school, and no artist, however great his\nreputation, attempted for many years to swim against the stream. In\nspite of the principles of liberty and equality which were claimed for\nall under the new r\u00e9gime, a terribly strict eye was kept upon any\ninnovations which might break out in the form of a naturalistic art.\n\nThe directors of this new movement failed to see that the conditions\nwhich had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed\naway, and that the latter's supremacy was due to the fact that their\nproductions were symbolical of the loftiest thoughts of their own\nepoch. The art which expresses the ambitions and noblest thoughts of\nits time will alone endure. These expressions are not applicable to\nany other condition than those which called them forth, and hence in\nattempting to purify the rococo which had existed up to the middle of\nthe eighteenth century, by a return to classical traditions, they were\nonly copying that which their predecessors had done, and in so doing\nleft us without any original expression of their own time.\n\nInto such a condition of affairs was Millet born, and he was numbered\namongst that little band of men which included Rousseau, Corot, Dupr\u00e9,\nDiaz, and Daumier, who were to lay the foundations of the modern\nnaturalistic school. At the outset it was seemingly a hopeless\nstruggle they undertook; a struggle against prejudice and influence\nwhich was only to be brought to a victorious culmination after years\nof struggle and disappointment. Of this little band, Millet was\nperhaps the best equipped for the privations which were necessary. He\ncame of a peasant stock who inhabited Gruchy, a small village\nsituated in the commune of Gr\u00e9ville, close to Cherbourg. Grouped\nunderneath the humble roof was the grandmother, who had been left a\nwidow fifteen years before; her son, Jean Louis Nicolas Millet, and\nhis wife and eight children, of which our artist was the second. His\ngrandmother appears to have been a pious old lady, whose chief delight\nwas in her grandchildren, to whom she taught those religious\nprinciples which stood them in good stead in after life. We are told\nthat Millet's father possessed a force of character one does not often\nfind amongst men in his rank of life. He was of a contemplative\ndisposition, and had a keenly developed feeling for natural beauty. He\npossessed moreover a keen appreciation of music, which unfortunately\nhe does not appear to have had much opportunity of cultivating. His\nwife was an excellent housewife and of a religious turn of mind. The\nhouse they occupied, situated quite a short distance from the sea, was\nplaced in a tract of country which, whilst it had rugged and\npicturesque features, was not of a nature which would yield\nextraordinary results under cultivation. It was, therefore, a hard\nstruggle for existence which Millet in his first years saw going\non around him. Not that the family were any the less happy for having\nto work laboriously for their livelihood. They had been brought up\namidst such surroundings; their wants were simple and easily\ngratified, and the tranquillity of the m\u00e9nage more than\ncounterbalanced those doubtful luxuries which easier circumstances\nwould have brought their way. Throughout his life Millet maintained\nthe extreme simplicity he had seen practised in the home of his\nchildhood, and long years afterwards he was accustomed to look back\nwith pleasureable memories upon his early years.\n\nGruchy, situated in one of the wildest parts of Normandy, feels the\nfull effect of every storm which blows up from the Atlantic. There is\nnothing to shelter the exposed hamlets studded along the coast from\nthe fury of the western gale, and the rocks are but too often strewn\nwith the wrecks of vessels which have come to grief in that terrible\nsea. Millet in his youth must have witnessed many of these\ncatastrophes. Quite a number of drawings by him are extant\nrepresenting succour being extended to some vessel in difficulties, or\nthe hauling up of some wreckage on to the rocks. The studious boy\nmust have been impressed as he saw the sternness of the combat in his\nnative country between men and nature; the wind-swept fields, and\nhills bare to the point of savageness. The very trees themselves\ndwarfed and gnarled; in their struggle with the elements they have\nbeen made tough and hardy as the inhabitants of the country\nthemselves, and, stunted as they are, yet show well that they can\nresist the force of the fiercest storm. The brooding and contemplative\ncharacter of the father having descended to the son, we can quite\nimagine the effect such surroundings would have upon him. As he looked\nback in after years upon his roamings in his native country, he\nappreciated the awe-inspiring character of the scenery in which he had\nbeen born. He would doubtless recall many a walk amidst the fields\nwith the wind blowing in his face as it rushed in from the Atlantic,\nthe rain beating hard upon the freshly ploughed fields, and the\ndistant figure of the ploughman struggling hard with his team against\nthe stiff sou'wester. The great mass of vapour overhead whirled before\nthe violence of the storm, casting grey and pearly light over the\nwhole scene, whilst far away on the top of the hill a clump of trees,\nbent with their resistance to the wind, are silhouetted against the\nsky. Many a drawing of this kind we encounter in the later work of\nMillet, which shows how his thoughts harked back in certain moments to\nthe scenes he had left behind him for ever.\n\nWe know that on one or two occasions he returned to Gruchy. Once or\ntwice he had urgent business which took him back, but sometimes he\nwent with no other purpose than to renew acquaintance with the scenes\nof yore.\n\nLittle Jean Fran\u00e7ois was his grandmother's favourite. It was she who\ntaught him the names of things which surrounded him, and perhaps\ndirected his thoughts in the channels to which they were finally to be\ndevoted. Her brother Charles, who formed one of the family, used to\ntake him for walks, telling him stories on the way. Millet was\ndevotedly attached to this old man, and when at the age of seven years\nhe lost him, the gap in his life thus left made an impression upon his\nmemory never to be effaced.\n\nFive years afterwards he was placed in the hands of the vicar for the\npurpose of preparing him for his first communion. The good man seems\nto have been taken with the child; he found him so attentive to all\nnatural phenomenon which was passing around him and intelligent in an\nunusual degree. He quickly learnt a considerable amount of Latin,\nwhich introduced him to the great classics. Unfortunately for Millet,\nthe vicar accepted an offer of transference to a better parish in the\nvicinity. The boy had made such progress with his master that it was\ndecided that he should go with him to his new abode. He was, however,\nso missed in his own home, that when he came back for his first\nholidays it was decided that he should not return.\n\nHe now gave serious attention to the agricultural pursuits of his\nfather. He threw himself heartily into the work of the farm, and\nassisted in the work of sowing and harvesting, of pruning and\nthrashing according to the season. His spare time was occupied in\nreading with avidity various masterpieces of literature. The authors\nhe found at hand were such as F\u00e9n\u00e9lon and Bossuet, but he developed a\ndecided preference, which lasted till the end of his life, for Virgil\nand the Bible.\n\nIt was at this time that his taste for art began to be developed.\n\nHe drew the objects he found around him, and soon acquired sufficient\nconfidence in his skill to execute a large drawing representing two\nshepherds keeping guard over their sheep. These first efforts date\nfrom about his seventeenth year, and foretell the advent of the style\nin which he was later to become pre-eminent.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE MIGRATION TO PARIS\n\n\nHow frequently has it happened that the first years in the life of a\ngenius have been employed in labour quite different from that to which\nthey should have been directed. Such a state of affairs the more often\noccurs when the sense of duty has been strong enough to overcome\ntemporarily the inclination to pursue the natural bent. In the case of\nMillet, however, the early years which he devoted to the farm and its\npursuits were by no means wasted. It is on record that he became very\nproficient in the various duties in which he was engaged, but at the\nsame time we can be quite sure that his extraordinary faculties of\nobservation were constantly being brought into play, and the fruits of\nhis observations are to be seen in the pictures of his mature period.\n\nA considerable portion of his spare time was taken up with drawing,\nnot only the persons and objects he found around him, but also\nsubjects suggested to him by the books he was in the habit of reading.\n\nHis family, so far from throwing any obstacles in his way, encouraged\nhim. In fact it was his father who took him first to Cherbourg in\norder to show a painter of that town, named Mouchel, the early\nproducts of his son's genius. The decision at which Millet p\u00e8re had\narrived was prompted by a drawing in charcoal of an old peasant\nwalking along the road, which had struck him forcibly as being a work\nof extraordinary merit. It says much for Mouchel's breadth of mind\nthat he was equally impressed with the drawings. A man who had been\nbrought up in the school of David, and who had lived in one of the\nmost reactionary periods of French art, was hardly to be expected to\ntake kindly to a style so diametrically opposed to all the traditions\ninto which he himself had been inculcated; certainly the young\nMillet, who had now arrived at the age of eighteen, had not developed\nthe extraordinary freedom which his works of ten years later\ndemonstrate. But there was sufficient originality even in his early\ndrawings to call forth condemnation from a man who had been so\nsaturated with the teaching of David.\n\nHe prevailed upon Millet to leave his son with him, and set him to\nwork to copy many well-known works of art which he brought before his\npupil by means of engravings. Two months were spent in this way when\nnews reached Millet that his father had been seized with sudden\nillness, and he was obliged in the circumstances to return to\nGr\u00e9ville. He arrived to find the old man unconscious, and very shortly\nafterwards he died.\n\nThis misfortune awoke in Millet a sense of duty which compelled him to\ndesert his studies in Cherbourg and superintend the management of the\nfarm. For some time he devoted himself entirely to his new duties, but\nthe struggle betwixt duty and genius continued; he gave himself to his\nwork with all the energy at his disposal, but his thoughts were ever\nwandering to his art.\n\nAdded to his own inclinations, his grandmother, who perceived his\nextraordinary gifts, strongly persuaded him to devote his attention\nentirely to art, and consequently after some little time he decided to\nreturn to Cherbourg. Here he entered the studio of M. Langlois, an\nartist whose reputation in the town was considerable. Again in this\nworthy man he came in contact with a painter who had been brought up\nentirely under classical influence. Langlois, who had in his early\ndays been a pupil of Gros, had absorbed the classical tradition to\nsuch an extent as to be incapable of appreciating any other style. He\nappears to have endeavoured to mould Millet in his own method rather\nthan develop the latent genius which the latter possessed. The\nincompatibility of these two men speedily caused the younger to strike\nout in his own way. He saw more good in frequenting the museums and\nmaking copies of such works as appealed to him than in listening to\nthe advice of his teacher. All this occurred, however, without any\nbreach of friendship occurring. On the contrary, Langlois, after\nperceiving the futility of inducing his pupil to follow in his\nfootsteps, did all he could to advance his interests.\n\nBy means of his influence some of Millet's drawings were brought\nbefore the Municipal Council, and Langlois suggested that Millet\nshould be sent to Paris in order to further his development, and that\nthe Council should set aside a modest pension to meet his requirements\nin that city. The discussion appears to have been very prolonged, and\nupon the question being put to a vote it was only carried by means of\nthe casting vote of the mayor. Four hundred francs was at first\nallotted to him in this way, which was further increased shortly\nafterwards to six hundred. Such encouragement, meagre though it was,\nwas sufficient to give him a foothold in the metropolis. He left\nCherbourg in January 1837, on a cold and raw day, the snow falling\nheavily throughout the entire journey, and arrived in Paris in a very\ndisheartened condition. The miserable weather, coupled with the long\njourney in which he had had time to think of the small sum which lay\nbetween him and starvation, going to a city which he had never seen\nbefore, had all served to work upon his nerves, and he entered the\ngreat city sick at heart and very despondent.\n\nOne of the first visits he made after he was somewhat settled down in\nParis was to the Louvre. Here he was brought into contact for the\nfirst time with many masters, who were to mould his yet plastic\ntemperament into the form which enabled him to give to the world, in\nlater years, so many masterpieces. As I have said before, it was\nMantegna who first captivated him, and the influence of the mighty\nPaduan was never finally to be shaken off. Michel Angelo awed him with\nhis sublimity; his classical severity tempered with intense humanism,\nhis masculine strength, were bound to have their effect upon so\nserious a character as Millet. Strange as it may seem to those who are\nbut superficially acquainted with his art, and are only too apt to\njudge him by the influence he has had upon modern French painting, he\nwas fascinated with the antique. The traditions of Phidias and\nPraxiteles, in the form in which they had been transmitted through the\ngreatest minds of the Renaissance, were ever the factors which guided\nhim throughout his career. It was this same spirit which impelled his\nfervid admiration for Nicolas Poussin, a master who to-day is sadly\nunderrated and but little understood. It was the mysteries of line,\nthe wonders of pose and composition rather than the magic of colour\nwhich appealed to him. He had a profound admiration for the glowing\ncanvases of Titian and Rubens, but he could never overlook entirely\ntheir defects of drawing or, in the case of Rubens, the tendency to\nvulgarity. From his remarks in after years it would appear that he was\nbaffled with the mysticisms of Velazquez and Rembrandt; pure painting\nitself could never hold him. He needed to grasp the message which lay\nbehind it before he felt fully taken into the confidence of the\npainter; and as the minds of the Dutchman and the Spaniard ran in\nquite different channels to his own, they spoke with a language he\nnever understood. That he had a perceptive and critically independent\nmind may be gauged from his enthusiasm for Delacroix, whose work he\nencountered for the first time at the Luxembourg.\n\nDuring this period of study he was carefully considering under what\nmaster he should place himself. His choice unhappily fell upon\nDelaroche. To any one acquainted with the work of the latter master,\na more unsuitable selection could not have been made. Delaroche and\nthe painters who surrounded him can be appropriately described as\nconstituting the back-wash of the Empire style, which had reached its\nclimax with David. His subjects were always treated with academic\nreserve. No pyrotechnics were permitted; on the contrary, an\neverlasting and mistaken striving for finish was encouraged:\noriginality was sternly suppressed. To paint human life as it really\nwas, was too vulgar for any of the painters of this time. They held\nthe public taste enslaved for years. An innovator such as Millet was\ndestined to become found his position almost untenable. The band of\ncritics and painters formed a monopoly which it seemed almost\nimpossible to break down, and it was only after years of bitter and\ndetermined struggle that the school of nature finally routed its\nopponent.\n\nDelaroche doubtlessly found the peasant painter a little rude both in\nhis person and in his ideas about art. He paid but little attention to\nthe young man who had placed himself in his hands, and devoted all his\ntime to students who were more amenable to his influence. A\ntemperament so sensitive as Millet's was bound to notice this\nneglect, and consequently after a time he became so discouraged that\nhe ceased to frequent Delaroche's studio. Another very good reason for\nthis action was the lack of resources to continue his payments. Even\nduring the time he had been with Delaroche he lost no opportunity of\nturning a few honest francs by painting the portraits of any who could\nbe got to sit to him. Delaroche, however, had a more kindly heart than\nMillet imagined. He seems to have found out the real distress of the\nyoung artist, and to have assisted him pecuniarily in many ways, and\nthere is no doubt that he appreciated the talent of the young Norman\nmuch more than he cared to own. Many of his remarks on record would\nserve to show that Delaroche already felt that his pupil was destined\nto be one of the leaders of the movement which was finally to\noverthrow his own style, and doubtlessly felt a great admiration for a\nman who had the courage and strength to swim against rather than with\nthe current.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STRUGGLE FOR RECOGNITION\n\n\nFreed from all encumbrances save poverty, Millet was now to work out\nhis own destiny according to the dictates of his genius. He joined a\nfriend named Marolle, and the two together occupying a very small\napartment endeavoured to eke out an existence. It was only too soon\napparent that young as he was, and the taste of the public being not\nyet ready for development upon the lines his genius directed him, that\nhis livelihood could not be secured by endeavouring to sell such\nsubjects as appealed to him. In these straits he turned to\nportrait-painting, just as many great painters before and since him\nhave done. That the struggle was very keen can well be imagined by the\nfact that he was unable to obtain more than five to ten francs apiece;\nand, as commissions were very scarce, he was hard put to gain the\nmeans of subsistence. This state of affairs lasted until 1840, in\nwhich year he endeavoured to obtain admission to the Salon with two\nportraits, one of which was that of his friend. This, however, was\nrejected, and the other picture, although accepted, was unnoticed by\neither the critics or the public.\n\nHaving occasion the next year to pay a visit to Cherbourg, he felt\nobliged to report himself to the Municipal Council who had had the\ngenerosity to send him in the first place to Paris. Its worthy members\nexpressed themselves as but little satisfied with the result of their\ninvestment; they claimed that they had had as yet but little to show\nfor their money, and they suggested, partly as a means of\ndemonstrating that they had had some little return, and also, in order\nto see of what stuff their prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was made, that he should paint a\nportrait of the recently deceased mayor. As Millet had not been\npersonally acquainted with that worthy citizen, and as the only guide\nwhich could be supplied him was a portrait made in miniature when he\nwas a young man of some twenty-three or twenty-four years of age, the\ntask was by no means easy. However, the artist set to work with a\nwill, and finally accomplished the picture to his own satisfaction.\n\nUpon it being shown to the Council, one and all declared, as any one\nwith the slightest knowledge of such matters could have told them\nbefore it was commenced, that it bore not the least resemblance to the\ndefunct magistrate. They therefore demurred at the three hundred\nfrancs they had agreed to pay him for the portrait, and offered him\none-third of that amount instead. Millet was deeply offended by the\ninsult, and informed the Council that he made them a present of the\npicture.\n\nIt was during this short visit to his native country that he met his\nfirst wife, a Mlle. Ono, whose portrait he had painted. From the first\nshe was very delicate, and he lost her after much suffering, three\nyears later. His second wife was Mlle. Catherine Lemaire, who was\ndestined to be the companion of his struggles until the end of his\nlife.\n\nMeanwhile Millet was occupied with subjects which he thought would\nappeal to the general public. A number of classical pictures date from\nthis epoch. It was an endeavour on his part to fall in as far as\npossible with the current taste, and so supply means of subsistence\nfor his family. At the same time he did not neglect his favourite\nsubjects, and many are the wonderful studies of peasant life which\ndate from these years. His reputation had so far advanced that he was\noffered the position of teacher of drawing in the college at\nCherbourg. It must have been only after prolonged deliberation that he\nrefused the proffered post. Here a certain annual stipend was assured\nhim, and if it was not large in itself it would at any rate suffice to\nkeep the wolf from the door. He preferred, however, to return to Paris\nand work out his own destiny as best he might.\n\nMillet, who lived at this time in the Rue Rochechouart, began to\nsurround himself with that little group of friends who remained\nfaithful to him until the end of his career. Amongst the earliest were\nCharles Jacque and Diaz: the latter had several clients amongst the\nsmall dealers, whom he induced to visit Millet's studio and make now\nand again a small purchase.\n\nMillet now became a fairly regular contributor to the Salon, but\ngenerally sent some classical or religious picture as well as one of\nhis peasant subjects. For example, in 1848 he sent the marvellous\nstudy of \"The Winnower,\" which we all know so well, accompanied by a\ncanvas, \"The Captivity of the Jews at Babylon.\" The latter, however,\nwas so badly received that he utilised the canvas upon its return for\na large picture of a \"Shepherdess tending her Sheep.\"\n\nIn spite of the headway that he was making, the struggle for existence\nseemed keener than ever, and but for the kindness of friends he and\nhis family would frequently have actually wanted for food. A timely\nadvance of one hundred francs obtained for him from the Minister of\nFine Arts, together with a commission from the State, for which he was\npaid the sum of eighteen hundred francs, were for some time the only\nrelief he obtained from his embarrassments. That he was not particular\nas to how he earned his daily bread is apparent from the fact that he\ndid not despise an order for a shop sign for a midwife, for which he\nwas paid the miserable amount of thirty francs.\n\nThe year 1848 was not an encouraging one for a painter who was\nstanding on the threshold of his career. The whole of Europe was\nseething with revolution. A repetition of the fearful year of 1792 was\neverywhere expected. The struggle betwixt reaction and property on the\none hand, and lawlessness and revolution on the other, was being waged\nwith grim determination. The issue was for long in the balance. One\nnever knew from one day to another what was going to happen. In such a\ndeplorable state of affairs men's minds were running on politics and\nwars rather than upon art. Millet amongst the rest was called upon to\nshoulder the musket, and it can be easily imagined with what\nreluctance he did so.\n\nParis, the great centre of art, had yet not afforded him much\nencouragement. Life was dear in the big city, and surrounded on all\nsides by bricks and mortar he was not free to go out into the fields\nand study the objects which were uppermost in his mind. He resolved to\nescape from it, and once having put the plan into execution he never\nreturned.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET IN HIS MATURITY\n\n\nThe Barbizon of 1850 was a very different place from the Barbizon of\nto-day. The world fame of the men who passed a quiet and strenuous\nexistence in the little village has transformed it into a tourist\nresort, with restaurants and caf\u00e9s, the stopping-places for\nwaggonettes which in summer bring their daily load of sightseers,\neager to see the homes of the painters whose names are now household\nwords.\n\nIt would have been well-nigh impossible for the little band to have\nchosen a more suitable spot for their labours. Rousseau and Millet,\nmuch as they were drawn towards each other by the tie of a sympathetic\ndisposition and by their common interest in art, yet were widely\ndissimilar from one another in their outlook upon art and their\nmethods of worship at the common shrine. Rousseau--one can see it from\nevery picture he painted--loved with all the yearning of a passionate\nand restless temperament the inanimate in Nature. Observe with what\nfidelity he draws his trees, with what caressing tenderness his clouds\nand skies are treated; solitude appealed to him above all things, and\nif here and there he was obliged to insert a few figures to complete\nhis composition, one instinctively feels that he would rather have\nsubstituted a group of cattle or a flock of sheep. In the glades of\nthe forest, far from the busy haunts of men, with the glorious\nsunlight penetrating from above, the breeze moaning through the\nbranches, he was happy. A wild and turbulent temperament such as his\nnot infrequently discovers exquisite enjoyment amidst such perfect\ntranquillity.\n\nBarbizon, situated on the fringe of the great forest of Fontainebleau,\ntherefore, permitted Rousseau to come into daily contact with the\nscenes which so appealed to him.\n\nMillet, on the other hand, was absorbed in the peasant. The man who\ntilled the soil and raised the produce humanity requires for its\nsubsistence by the sweat of his brow; the manifold duties of the\nlabourer, his life and sorrows, appealed to him with irresistible\nforce. An unpeopled track of wild and uncultivated land would not call\nforth any emotion in him, no matter how sublime the scenery might be.\n\nThe life of the village, spreading itself into the vast and fertile\nplain behind, held him absorbed; a peasant himself and living amongst\nthe people he so loved, he was in a position to bring before an\nunthinking world the poignant monotony of their useful lives.\n\nUpon their first arrival at Barbizon, the two artists put up at a\nsmall inn, working all day in a tiny place they had rented from some\npeasants and fitted up as a studio. The inconveniences of this\narrangement were soon apparent, and shortly afterwards Millet took a\nsmall house which was destined to be his abode for the remainder of\nhis life; an old barn in the immediate vicinity meanwhile provided him\nwith an excellent studio.\n\nFrom this period onward we must date the greatest productions of the\nmaster, the works which have induced more thought than those of any\nother peasant painter. A peasant among peasants, his life was of the\nmost rigid simplicity. Behind his little abode a large garden\nstretched away almost to the fringe of the forest itself, and here he\nwas accustomed to work every morning, growing a portion of the food\nnecessary to the sustenance of his family. The afternoon he devoted to\npainting, whilst the evening was given over to intercourse with his\nlittle circle of friends. The simplicity and tranquillity of his life\naroused the whole of his powers to action, and surrounded with\neverything he valued in life he was supremely happy.\n\nThe country around Barbizon appealed to him irresistibly. The\ntimber-studded plains, the gently undulating, highly cultivated\nfields, presented a strange contrast to the wild and rugged country\namidst which he had spent his childhood, and no doubt conduced to the\ndevelopment of a more refined and contemplative style than he would\notherwise have acquired. Upon his few visits to his native country he\nappears to have been more impressed than ever with its austerity, and\nthe drawings which these journeys called forth bore ample evidence of\nthis feeling in him.\n\nLack of the necessary funds to carry on even his simple m\u00e9nage was\never the bane of Millet's life. On many occasions Sensier, his\nintimate friend and afterwards his biographer, informs us he dissuaded\nhim from suicide.\n\nThe sums that he owed, small though they were, rendered him in\nconstant fear of the brokers. With creditors so importunate in their\ndemands for satisfaction, and with the constant lack of recognition,\nwhich was his lot, it is astonishing that Millet achieved so much. He\nwas relieved more than once by the kind-hearted and ever faithful\nRousseau, who when his friend was sorest pressed found some delicately\nhidden means to relieve him. It was he who acquired for 4000 francs\nthe wonderful \"Peasant grafting a Tree,\" when the picture failed to\nfind a purchaser; and in order that Millet should not be aware of his\ngenerosity, he made the offer in the name of an imaginary American.\n\nThis sort of goodness he repeated more than once, and it redounds\nstill more to his credit when we remember that Rousseau himself was\nnot infrequently in pecuniary difficulties.\n\nA constant succession of important works made their appearance during\nthe first ten years Millet spent at Barbizon. The first was the\nwell-known \"Sower,\" which has ever been one of the most popular of his\npictures. Then came the far finer \"Peasants going to Work,\" which for\nmany years was in an English Collection. The \"Gleaners,\" perhaps the\nnoblest canvas the master ever painted, dates from 1857, in which year\nit was seen at the Salon; the celebrated \"Angelus\" followed it two\nyears later. The prices which Millet obtained for this series of\nremarkable works was fantastically small. The \"Gleaners\" brought him a\npaltry 2000 francs, whilst he accounted himself lucky to encounter an\namateur who gave him the same sum for the small \"Woman feeding Fowls.\"\n\nThe \"Angelus,\" which was never exhibited, was sold in the year it was\npainted to a Monsieur Feydeau, an architect, for 1800 francs. It then\npassed through several hands before the late Monsieur Secr\u00e9tan\ncompeted up to 160,000 francs before he became possessed of the prize\nat the John Wilson sale.\n\nThe purchase, however, proved a sound investment, for upon the\ndispersal of his collection it was knocked down for 553,000 francs to\na Monsieur Proust, acting on behalf of the French Government. The\nlatter, however, when they gave the commission to buy the picture, had\nno idea that such a high value would be placed upon it, and\nconsequently refused to ratify the sale; a syndicate now came upon the\nscene, who took it to America. The price, however, proved greater than\neven the millionaires of the States were prepared to give, and the\ncanvas again returned to France, where it found a resting-place in the\ncollection of Monsieur Chauchard, who paid the enormous sum of 800,000\nfrancs for its possession.\n\nIn 1859 Millet sent two works to the Salon, a \"Woman grazing her Cow,\"\nand \"Death and the Woodman.\" The latter, one of the most\nphilosophical of Millet's pictures, which to-day is the principal\nattraction of the Jacobsen Museum at Copenhagen, was rejected.\n\nDisappointments of this kind came with such systematic regularity to\nthe painter that he must have become proof against them. He always had\nbitter enemies amongst the critics, who never failed to pour abuse\nupon his method and his subjects. Even a number of his fellow artists\njoined in the chorus of disapproval. But the vehemence with which he\nwas attacked was striking evidence of the impression he was making and\nthe inward sense of his own powers; and the fact that he was working\nout his destiny according to the dictates of his own genius supported\nhim against this outpouring of prejudice and malice. The social side\nof life appealed to him more strongly as the years rolled on, and the\nmurmurings which had been heard in 1859 as to the socialistic\ntendencies of \"Death and the Woodman\" swelled to a roar when the\nstupendous \"Man with the Hoe\" was exhibited fourteen years later. The\nlatter, one of the most virile studies of depraved humanity which the\nworld has ever seen, has always been a favourite with social\nreformers, and has inspired one remarkable poem. Even his most\nimplacable critics were disarmed before this canvas; its power was\nmagnetic; it was an inspiration, soul moving and trenchant.\n\nHis financial difficulties never completely dispersed. At one time, in\norder to insure himself a little tranquillity, he made a contract with\ntwo speculators, whereby they were to become possessors of all the\nwork he produced for three years, in consideration of their assuring\nhim a thousand francs a month. A great number of Millet's finest\nproductions passed thus through their hands, including the \"Return\nfrom the Fields\" and the \"Man with the Hoe.\" The partners were not\nlong in quarrelling, and after a lawsuit had been fought, Millet was\nleft in the hands of a man who frequently would not or could not pay\nhim in ready money, and whose bills he was frequently forced to\ndiscount at considerable loss.\n\nOne little gleam of sunshine rendered his later days happy. This was a\ncommission from a Colmar banker, Monsieur Thomas by name, who required\nfour allegorical compositions representing the Seasons, to decorate\nhis rooms. The artist was overjoyed by this piece of good fortune,\nand immediately commenced a most conscientious study of such mural\ndecoration as was within reach, in order that he might do full justice\nto his patron. He paid frequent visits to Fontainebleau and the\nLouvre, and even desired a friend to inquire if he could not obtain\nreproductions of the frescoes at Herculaneum and Pompeii. In spite of\nall this elaborate preparation, the subjects were not such as appealed\nto his genius, and in spite of them being well and soundly painted, we\nare told that they presented no features which called for special\ncomment.\n\nHe found, however, a much more genial occupation in accomplishing a\nseries of drawings ordered by a Monsieur Gavet, who paid the artist\n1000, 700, and 450 francs each, according to their size. He made\naltogether ninety-five drawings in this way, and it is said that this\ngentleman had in his possession the finest work in black and white and\nwater-colour the artist ever executed.\n\nTowards the latter end of his life the death of dear relatives and\nfriends cast a sorrowful gloom over him. Amongst the latter Rousseau,\nwho expired in his presence on the 22nd of December 1867, was\nperhaps the loss which seemed to him hardest to bear. A staunch and\ntrusty friend, who was to be relied upon when his prospects seemed the\nmost hopeless, he had been one of the very few who had appreciated\nMillet's talents at their full worth, and who, moreover, scanty as his\nown means were, was ever ready to stretch out his hand to assist his\nstruggling friend.\n\nShortly afterwards Millet paid a visit to his patron, Herr Hartmann,\nat M\u00fcnster, and from here he went for a short time into Switzerland.\n\nUpon his return he devoted himself with great earnestness to work, and\nachieved a certain success at the Salons with his exhibits. The\noutbreak of the war with Germany caused him to migrate with his family\nto Cherbourg, where he thought he might continue to work, removed as\nfar as possible from the scenes of carnage and struggle which were\ngoing on farther east. Transported once more amongst the scenes of his\nchildhood, he felt an increased impetus to production, and when he\nreturned to Barbizon late in 1871, he brought with him a number of\ncanvases of the highest quality; conspicuous amongst them was the\nwonderful \"Gr\u00e9ville Church,\" now in the Louvre.\n\nThe anxieties of his troublous life were, however, beginning to show\ntheir effect upon his constitution; a persistent cough developed, and\nalthough an amelioration would occasionally occur, it was always\nsucceeded by a worse condition than before. His health suffered a\ngeneral decline, and he finally breathed his last on the 20th of\nJanuary 1875. He was buried in the little cemetery of Chailly, beside\nhis friend Rousseau, amidst the scenery they both loved so well.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE MAN AND HIS ART\n\n\nMillet is an instance of an artist working out his own destiny,\nimpelled by irresistible genius, in the teeth of seemingly\ninsurmountable obstacles. He started life with enormous disadvantages;\nwithout friends in influential circles to spread his fame or plead his\ncause; without money to enable him to outlive and triumph over the\nignorant fanaticism of critics and artists, so soaked in the\nconventionalised art of their time that they had not perception enough\nto appreciate the full meaning of that naturalistic movement, which\nwas finally to sweep away the quasi-classic art they boasted of with\nsuch bombastic effusion. The path was hard and thorny, and his triumph\nwas not finally consummated until after his death. He himself found\nhis only satisfaction in the fact that he had lived his life according\nto the dictates of his genius, and had achieved the maximum of which\nhe was capable.\n\nMillet and our own Cotman were somewhat kindred spirits; there is much\nmore affinity between the work of the two men than is apparent to any\none who has not closely studied them. The marvellous \"Breaking the\nClod,\" now happily permanently housed at the British Museum, betrays\nthe same tremendous conception and broad outlook which characterises\nmany a drawing of Millet's. Both highly strung to a painful extent,\nthey were each conscious of their inability to curb the power which\nprescribed a certain course for them, and in spite of pecuniary\ndifficulties and unpopularity, an inevitable result of their intense\noriginality, they pursued a steady course to the end of their lives.\n\nThe socialistic doctrines which have been read into the work of Millet\nare rather the outcome of the world's uneasy conscience being brought\nface to face with a crushing indictment of existing conditions, than\nof any design on the artist's part to further the cause of a political\npropaganda by means of his art. This somewhat extravagant reading into\nhis art has certainly been carried to excess. Particularly has such\nbeen the case in America, where a large number of his finest works are\nat present to be found, curiously enough in the hands of enormously\nwealthy people, who are frequently perhaps the least able to\nunderstand the real meaning of his message.\n\nComing from a peasant stock, his sympathies were always with the\npeasant; it was the only class he understood or cared for. He lived as\none of them, and shared to a large extent in their labour. He has been\ndesignated, not inappropriately, the philosopher in sabots. Rightly or\nwrongly he has come to be looked upon as one of the high priests of\ncommunistic doctrines. Few pictures have been so anathematised as the\n\"Man with the Hoe,\" and perhaps none have done more to inculcate\nsympathy with the degradation of the lower orders of the human race.\n\nThe revolting brutality and vacancy of that face haunts the\nimagination. Is it possible that fellow-creatures so utterly debased\nby toil and neglect exist? Millet dispels any doubt upon the question\nby bequeathing to humanity this trenchant portrait. By no means\nlimited to Barbizon or France, these poor creatures exist in every\ncountry, and curiously enough are considered an essential element in\neach country's development.\n\nThis poignantly human note is observable in almost every work Millet\nwrought; his passionate sympathy with his fellow-man is the keynote of\nhis art. The wood-cutter in his arduous toil, the shepherd in his\nsolitariness, the labourer turning the soil with unvarying and\nlaborious monotony, the mother caring for her children--all carry the\nsame message for him of that strange and incomprehensible mingling of\njoy and sadness we call life. Like many great minds before and since\nhis time, our artist found the greatest joy in life in a placid and\nnever changing melancholy. But the peasants he chose knew nothing of\nthe sadness he saw in them. Completely inured to their toil, and\nsubdued by it, with no refining or uplifting influence to stimulate\nthem, they knew nothing, aspired to nothing beyond what they were; it\nwas left to Millet to supply the \"might have been.\" He saw the inky\nblackness of the mind of the \"Man with the Hoe,\" the pathetic\ninequality between the mounted farmer directing the safe storage of\nhis crop, and the stooping figures of the \"Gleaners\" eager to scrape\nup the miserable crumbs which had fallen from the rich man's table. He\ntraced the lives of these simple folk until we arrive at the grim and\ngaunt figure of Death, who, as he grasps the woodman by the shoulder,\nreminds him that his course is finished and that he, in common with\nall his fellow-men, must enter the great unknown land from which there\nis no return. It is a sad and melancholy art, vibrating with purity\nand truth, the outpouring of a great soul yearning to express itself\nto the utmost of its power. The mind and character of the man can be\nread in every line and in every touch of the brush. His drawings and\netchings are even more searching in their virility than his pictures.\n\nThere is a spontaneousness about them we search for in vain in his\nwork in oil and pastel. In black and white his intensely emotional\nmind found a swift method of expression; in the laboriousness of oil\npainting he was fettered with the complications of the medium. It can\nbe fairly said that only in one or two paintings--a notable example\ncan be cited in the wondrous \"Sawyers\" at South Kensington--does he\nrise to the height of a great painter. Millet was a poet, a\nphilosopher, a great thinker, and the means he chose for expressing\nhimself were those which were best fitted to his purpose. His\npredilections in art were concentrated upon the greatest, and\nconsequently the men who appealed to him were the thinkers of the\nages. Mantegna and Correggio, Michel Angelo and the mighty Greeks,\nthese were the masters who left their impress upon his mind and art.\n\nThe influence of so sincere and profound an artist has necessarily\nbeen profound. He has moulded men who have achieved world-wide fame;\nSegantini, for example, would never have risen to the heights he did\nhad the example of Millet not been ever before him. There have been\nmany who, without possessing his genius, have endeavoured to follow\nin his footsteps, but successfully as his imitators have sometimes\ncaught his style, their productions can never live alongside his,\nbecause they lack the real ring of sincerity.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n        a. One bed, or folding cot,\n        b. One oil stove,\n        c. One lamp,\n        d. Enough supplies of all kinds sufficient for six months,\n        e. Pots, pans, kettles, etc.\nIt is needless to say that positions in Manila and Iloilo were now at\na premium.\n\nWas it possible that teachers were to be sent to places where even the\nnecessaries of life could not be obtained! Was it possible that many\nwould be sent to places so remote that for six months no fresh\nsupplies could be gotten! A mass meeting was held at once, and a\ncommittee was appointed to send a cablegram to the Associated Press\npetitioning aid from the American people at large. Realizing what\nconsternation would be created throughout the United States by such a\nmessage, two of the teachers leaped into a carriage at the close of\nthe meeting and a few moments later were closeted with the chief\nexecutive of the department. As a result the committee was persuaded\nnot to send the cablegram to the Associated Press until by courtesy it\nhad been sent to the President. Of course, this diplomatic move tided\naffairs over and the teachers who had flatly refused to budge from\nManila now agreed to go on to their stations, being assured that\nwhatever action was best would be taken.\n\nThe day had come when we must separate. We were to enter an untried\nand an unknown field. It was fitting that we have a final joyous\nmeeting, so the best orchestra in the archipelago was engaged and we\n\"chased the hours with flying feet\" until dawn so that whatever might\ncome to us in that unknown future upon which we were entering each\nwould hold in pleasant memory our last evening together.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER III. - A DRAMA IN ACTUAL LIFE.\n\n\nAlmost every one heeded the warning to go to his station forearmed\nwith at least necessaries of life, but, as it had never fallen to the\nlot of the writer to cook, he refused to learn at that late day, so he\ntook no pot, no pan, no kettle, putting his future into the hands of\nan uncertain fate and relying upon the unknown hospitality of the\nFilipino.\n\nBacalod, the capital of the province of Occidental Negros, was our\ndestination. The second morning after leaving Manila, we awoke with\nthe \"Kilpatrick\" lying at anchor in a shallow bay. We were several\nmiles from the shore and nothing in sight indicated that we had\nreached a place of any importance. Late the night before we had been\nawakened by the loud, sharp ringing of the ship's bells, accompanied\nby the reversal of the engines and a general disturbance awaking the\ncrew. So our first impressions on coming on deck were that we had run\naground. But the captain assured us that everything was ship-shape and\nthat this was the nearest point of approach to Capiz, a town of\nconsiderable importance on the island of Panay, where a body of troops\nwas to embark for home. Not even the grass hut of a native was in\nsight. Search as we would, not a sign was seen of a stream flowing\ninto the sea, indicating the probable presence of a town. There was\nnot a sign of life of any kind save one lone column of thin, blue\nsmoke that arose from the side of a mountain miles away. One would\nhave thought that we were explorers of three hundred years ago lying\noff the shore of some unknown land.\n\nAfter breakfast the steam launch, together with all the boats, was\nlowered, and several of us who had determined to miss no opportunity\nto gather information about the islands took our places in the launch\nby the side of the ship's mate, and steamed away across the water with\na long line of boats strung out in the rear. We headed away toward a\ngroup of cocoanut trees, and about an hour later stepped ashore on a\npile of decayed coral rocks that extended some twenty or thirty feet\nout into the water, thus forming the only landing place of a town of\nseveral thousands of people and of considerable commercial importance.\n\nA few moments after we had landed, an army wagon drawn by a\nmagnificent pair of mules came up out of a tropical jungle along a\nnarrow road. We clambered into the wagon and were soon lost in the\ndepths of foliage from which we had just seen the vehicle emerge.\n\nLong waving bamboos with their plumy leafage hung over the road from\neach side, meeting and overlapping in the center until they formed an\narchway so dense that the tropical sun now high in the heavens\npenetrated it only at intervals. At times the wagon sank up to the\nhubs in the soft earth, and the muscles of the mules stood out like\nwhip-cords under the skin as they drew us forward.\n\nAt a sharp turn in the road we came upon the first division of troops\nthat was to embark for home. The look of joy upon their sun-browned\nfaces was inexpressible. Their work was done, and with elastic step\nand smiling faces they saluted us as they passed by. The reign of\nforce was at an end; it was going out with them; the reign of peace\nhad begun; it was coming in with us.\n\nIn the afternoon when we returned from the town the last of the troops\nhad arrived and, as we drove up, the bugle was sounding the call to\nsupper. We noticed native women mingling with the troops and, indeed,\na native woman was in constant attention waiting upon one of the\nsoldiers with whom we ate. Her clothes were clean, her hair was nicely\ncombed, and her general appearance was neat. She seemed to anticipate\nthe slightest wish of the soldier with whom she was. She brought him\nwater to drink, cleaned his plate after the meal and saw that his\nknife, fork, and spoon were put into his haversack.\n\nWe had now finished supper and the launch had returned for the last\nload of troops. The lieutenant in command of the company gave the\norder to \"fall in\"; the men shouldered their rifles and fell into\nline. \"Forward, march!\" called the lieutenant, and the column swept\nforward towards the boats. The women had until now restrained\nthemselves, but, as their husbands marched away never to return, their\nfeelings could no longer be restrained. One young woman of about\neighteen, who was leaning against a rock by the roadside sobbing, when\nher husband passed, leaped up in frenzy of passionate love and caught\nthe rifle from his shoulder. Her first impulse seemed to be to throw\nthe gun away, but suddenly realizing the futility of such an act she\nburst into tears, shouldered the rifle herself and marched on by his\nside. Another woman of more mature age threw her arms around the legs\nof a tall stalwart man, and drew him bodily from the line.\n\nBut the troops marched on and entered the boats. One woman who had\nbeen unnoticed before came down into the shallow water and caught hold\nof our last boat as if to prevent its leaving, while others stood\nmingling their sobs with the sounds of the wavelets as they broke on\nthe sands. As we passed away, an expectant mother, standing in bold\noutline against the twilight sky, threw up her hands in an agony of\ndespair and then sank upon the stones. The curtain had fallen upon a\ndrama in actual life deeper in pathos than any other we had ever seen\nor ever expected to see. Depth of passion, depth of love! Who can\nfathom the human heart?\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. - WHAT THE TEACHERS DID.\n\n\nThere is a remarkable sameness about the towns in the Philippines.\n\nThey all have a large open square about the middle of the town, around\nthree sides of which are Chinese stores, unless one side lies open to\nthe sea, and on the fourth is the great stone ecclesia. The streets\nrun at right angles to one another and divide up the town into\ncreditable squares.\n\nEverybody in the Philippines lives up-stairs, for the ground is so\nsoaked with water during the rainy season that it is a menace to\nhealth to live upon the ground floor. So even the poorest nippa hut\nis built upon stakes four or five feet above the ground.\n\nBacalod is a typical Philippine town. As we landed, a broad open\nsquare was spread out before us. Two sides of the square were lined\nwith two-story houses in which were Chinese stores below and Filipino\nhomes above. On the third side stood the great stone church in whose\nmassive tower the clock was striking the hour of four, while the\nfourth lay open to the sea that had borne us thither.\n\nWe landed, but it was in a method new to us and one not usually\nemployed by the traveling public.\n\nWhen our sail boat ran aground on the sandy bottom a hundred yards or\nmore from the shore, a crowd of Filipino men who were on the beach\nslowly rolled up their pantaloons and waded out to the rescue,--for\nthe money that was in it. The boat's crew elevated their trousers'\nlegs also and slided down into the water. Each of us then straddled\nthe neck of a Filipino standing in the water and was held by ankles to\nbe steadied while our biped mounts proceeded to the shore.\n\nWe were now on the ground and face to face with the situation. To give\nthe reader an idea of the actual conditions met by the first teachers\nwho went to the Islands, the following is copied from the instructions\ngiven us in Manila:\n    1. There shall be two sessions daily of all schools, and the\n    last hour of the morning session shall be devoted solely to\n    instructing the Filipino teachers.\n\n    2. In cases where teachers are sent to a town in which there\n    is no school-house, they are expected to secure the aid of the\n    people and have one built.\n\n    3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is\n    stopped.\n\n    4. All supplies must be kept under lock and key. In towns\n    where there is no case or box to lock the supplies in, and it\n    is also impossible to get the town council to furnish a case,\n    a requisition may be sent to Manila, and, if an appropriation\n    can be secured, one will be made and sent out.\n\nThus it can be easily seen that we were indeed pioneers. In many\nplaces no school-house was to be found, and in some cases it was even\ndifficult to get the town council to provide a case in which to keep\nthe supplies.\n\nThe work of the teachers was, in short; to \"make the English language\nthe basis of instruction in the public schools.\" On our arrival at\nBacalod two schools were found in progress, for some soldiers had been\ndetailed for the work here previous to our coming. One of these was\nfor boys and the other, for girls. Thus the work here had been in a\nmeasure simplified, but complications that had arisen at Talisay, one\nof the largest and richest towns on the island, demanded a change of\nteachers and the writer was assigned to the place as superintendent.\n\nHere an attempt had been made to start a school but it had failed\nignominiously and a system of education was to be put into operation\nfrom the very start.\n\nThe Filipinos are not strong advocates of co-education, so separate\nschools were to be started for the boys and the girls. The one for the\nboys was gotten well in hand before the one for the girls was\nattempted at all.\n\nA few days after reaching the town and securing a home the\npresidente of the town had it publicly announced that the following\nMonday morning at eight o'clock a public school for boys would be\nopened in a building that had been rented for the purpose by the\nmunicipal council. About the middle of the afternoon of the same day a\nman beat a little drum throughout all the streets of the town to call\nthe people out and the town clerk announced both in Spanish and in the\nnative language that this public school would begin at the time and\nplace mentioned above; that instruction would be free to all who came;\nthat the government would furnish all supplies; and that instruction\nwould be given in the English language. A native principal and\nassistants were employed and everything was ready to begin.\n\nThe official report of the result is as follows:\n    Boys' public school of Talisay, Negros, P. I., began November\n    4, 1901. Forty-three boys present at eight o'clock. Forty-one\n    of them knew \"good morning\" and \"good afternoon\" but do not\n    know the distinction between them. Two of them speak simple\n    Spanish. At eight forty-five, eight more, who had been\n    attending an early morning private school, came in together.\n\n    The books they brought were so varied and so different from\n    one another that it seemed impossible to bring any reasonable\n    degree of order out of such a chaos, and so, after struggling\n    vainly for about a week with the problem, the superintendent\n    by one fell stroke removed everything in use and put in a\n    uniform system, and from that day on the English language has\n    been the basis of instruction in the public schools of\n    Talisay. The work was of necessity very slow at first, but by\n    the end of a year two schools were going nicely and a number\n    of the brightest boys and girls had made really excellent\n    progress.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER V. - A \"BAILE.\"\n\n\nNot long after the arrival of our party at Bacalod we received an\ninvitation to a \"baile\" given in our honor by the inhabitants of\nSilay, a town some ten or twelve miles up the northern coast and one\nnoted for its social life. The invitation was accepted with pleasure,\nand about the middle of the afternoon on the day appointed we were\nclad in the immaculate white of the tropics and steaming away up the\ncoast on board a launch sent for our conveyance. Twilight was still\nlingering on the path of day when we anchored just off shore at the\ntown. A row-boat containing the officials of the city came out to meet\nus and, in due season, we were ushered into a spacious drawing-room\nfilled almost to overflowing with the \u00e9lite of the town. The \u00e9lite of\ntowns in the Philippines speak Spanish, and, as only one or two of our\nparty could at that time boast of more than a formal acquaintance with\nthe Castilian tongue, the exchange of ideas that evening between us\nand the Filipinos was of necessity not very rapid.\n\nThe necessity of easy communication between us was rendered somewhat\nless indispensable by the announcement of supper as soon as we were\nrested from our trip. When we had taken our places at the table a\nyoung Filipino about twenty-five years of age arose and gave a lengthy\ntoast to the recent union of the Philippines with the United States.\n\nBut as we Americans were unable to scale the dizzy heights of his\nclimaxes or sink to the depths of his pathos, we forewent the\npleasures of his oratory and turned our attention to the savory odor\nof lamb, chicken, and roast pig that came slyly stealing up our\nnostrils to send us nerve dispatches about the gastronomic delights of\nour not far distant future.\n\nAt last the toast was ended and the world-wide soup ushered in a long\ntrain of things good to eat, served in a style better fitted to the\ndelights of the appetite than to the formalities of dinners, for, as\nsoon as the pleasant task of one dish was completed by any one, the\nnext was served him at once regardless of the progress made by the\nothers at the table.\n\nThe last course was dulce. The new-comers to the Philippines will\nnot be long in making the acquaintance of this dish, and at all\nmeetings, both public and private, where eatables are served, it\nperforms an important part. It is anything sweet, and it may vary all\nthe way from an india-rubber-like black mixture of cocoanut milk and\ndirty sugar to a really toothsome and respectable confection. No\nmatter of what materials a dish is composed, just so long as it is\nsweet, it is dulce.\n\nAfter paying our respects to this last course, we arose from the table\nand entered a great rectangular room from the center of whose ceiling\nhung a large glass chandelier, a mass of shimmering crystals. In the\nchairs around the room were the wealth, the youth, and the beauty of\nthe town.\n\nThe first and also the last number of every Filipino dance of any\nformality is the \"rigodon.\" The dancers are arranged in a square, or\nquadrangle according to the number participating, and are then led\nthrough a tangled maze of figures that so utterly bewilders the novice\nthat he sinks into his chair at the end of the dance wondering how it\nall came to pass.\n\nWe Americans breathed a sigh of relief when the \"rigodon\" ended, and\nmustered fresh courage for social conquests in the waltz that was now\nbreathing forth from the trembling strings. My companion in the first\ndance had been the young lady by whose side I had sat at dinner. But\nit now became necessary to search for another, so I prudently waited\nto see how partners were chosen, and made no mistake when a few\nmoments later I faced one of the most luscious looking se\u00f1oritas on\nthe opposite side of the room and offered her my arm. My eyes must\nhave told the story that my lips could not utter in Spanish, for she\nsmiled upon me sweetly, arose, and put her hand upon my shoulder. My\narm encircled her waist and I began to waltz. Unfortunately my\ncompanion did not follow, but began to hop up and down in a manner\nmost distressing. Supposing the attack to be only temporary, I paused\nand, much to my relief, she soon showed signs of recovery; and in the\ncourse of time she came to a standstill looking up into my face in an\ninquiring sort of way, apparently wondering why St. Vitus had not paid\nhis respects to me also. A second attempt to follow the music met with\nresults similar to the first, and during the third attempt, which\nseemed to be trembling on the verge of a failure, St. Vitus let go my\ncompanion and seized me with such vigor that she, who was small even\nfor a Filipino, was gathered up bodily and taken around the room at\nsuch a pace that her toes touched the floor only at far distant\nintervals.\n\nAt this point my devotion to the shrine of Terpsichore ceased from\nforce of circumstances and I seated myself in one of the most\ncomfortable chairs in sight that I might carry out a previously formed\nplan to study the Filipino somewhat critically as he appears in\nsociety.\n\nThe first thing that impressed me as the dancers passed up and down\nthe room was the flash of diamonds. Nearly every woman in the room had\non a brooch that flashed the colors of the rainbow at every turn.\n\nAlmost all of them wore one or more rings that showed up brilliantly\nunder the chandelier. Many of the men too, especially the young men,\nwore gems that appeared to be exquisite. A closer inspection showed\nthat some of the gems had flaws and others were of a poor color, but\nno one would have denied that, taken as a whole, it was a really\nbeautiful display.\n\nThe dress of the ladies was richly colored. Many of their skirts were\nof silk covered with hand embroidered flowers, and their filmy pina\nwaists and broad collar pieces were rich with needle-work. They all\nwore a kind of heelless velvet slipper, very common as a dress shoe in\nthe Philippines, or high-heeled patent leather shoes with neatly\nfitting black stockings.\n\nThe men were dressed in white coats and white pantaloons or black\ncoats and white pantaloons. White shirts and collars, together with\nall sorts and styles of cravats and low-cut patent leather shoes with\nhighly colored socks completed their dress.\n\nIt was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money;\nthat they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a\ntable loaded with good things was a fact to which all of us were\nenthusiastic witnesses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VI. - A SKETCH OF LIFE IN THE PHILIPPINES.\n\n\nHouse-keeping in the Philippines presents some interesting phases. Our\nclub of American officials decided to run a mess, so we employed a\ncook and a house boy, then each of us provided himself with a personal\nservant, making a total of six servants for four men--it takes about\nthis proportion of servants to live in any sort of comfort in the\nPhilippines--and launched ourselves boldly upon the sea of domestic\neconomy. But there were shoals ahead of us, for the question of\nregulating servants is one of no small importance in the Philippines,\nand one of its most disadvantageous features is the long chain of\ndependents that usually attends it.\n\nWe gave the cooks so much a day with which to buy supplies in the\nlocal market, for our own table, making him render a daily list of\nexpenditures, and a fixed amount besides to purchase rice and fish for\nhimself and the other servants. Of course, if they wished to vary\ntheir diet and get chicken and fresh pork, which could be had at far\ndistant intervals, it was wholly a matter of their option, but the\nallowance was made on the basis of so much rice and fish a day for\neach. This allowance was about fifteen cents a day in Spanish coin per\nservant.\n\nThus far all was well. We had agreed to give the cook eight dollars a\nmonth in Spanish money, thinking that good wages would procure good\nservice, but the visions of affluence that floated before him on such\nfloods of wealth were so alluring that they drew him from the kitchen\nto the cooler veranda. In less than a week he had employed an\nassistant at four dollars a month; in less than another week that\nassistant had employed him an assistant at two dollars a month; in\nless than another week that assistant to the assistant had employed\nhim an assistant at the princely salary of fifty cents a month; and\nfrom fear that the chain of dependents would end only by our having\nthe whole Filipino race attached to our culinary force, we broke up\nhouse-keeping and went boarding again, choosing that as the less of\nthe two evils.\n\nOur house furnishings were almost wholly Philippine. The table ware\nand the food on the table came from the ends of the earth. The knives\nand forks were made in Germany, the plates were manufactured in\nEngland, the glass ware and table cloth, in the United States. The\noatmeal and flour came from the United States also. The butter came\nfrom Australia, the rice from China, the salt from Russia, and the\nother eatables from sources about as various as their separate names.\n\nSwitzerland furnished the condensed milk and Illinois the canned\ncream. Nearly all of the canned fruit bore labels from Spain.\n\nThus it can easily be seen that life in the Philippines, if lived\naccording to American ideals, is dependent upon a highly developed and\nhighly complex commerce. However, the difficulties of transportation\nand the restriction of large stocks of merchandise to Manila and some\nhalf a dozen other towns, make so great a difference between country\nlife and city life that a short comparison of the two will not be out\nof place, and life in Manila may well be taken as being fairly typical\nof the latter.\n\nLife in Manila is pleasant, but expensive. It is pleasant from the\nfact that it is not only the capital but also metropolis of the\narchipelago. Thus the combination of wealth and high official position\nhas given to Manila a society of the highest and most refined type.\n\nThe process of beautifying and improving the city which is constantly\ngoing on bids fair to give us at no distant day a city of which we may\nwell be proud.\n\nBut let him who intends living well in Manila on a small income bid\nfarewell at once to so idylic a dream, for it costs much to live well\nthere. In the city of Manila one can get almost anything he wishes,\nbut it must be paid for at the price it commands. Especially in the\ncase of eatables, this price is by no means small, because to the\nfirst cost of articles must in most cases be added the expense of\ndistant shipment from American, European, or Australian ports, and not\ninfrequently the cost of long refrigeration must also be taken into\nconsideration. But, expensive though it is, it is very pleasant to\nlive there and those who have once enjoyed it often wish again to\nquaff the cup of its delights.\n\nIn strong contrast to this pleasant life is the life of the quiet\nlittle hamlet away in the distant islands. Indeed, the Filipino from\nthe distant town, who by some good fortune has been to Manila, or, by\na coup de main, has studied in one of the Manila colleges, is looked\nup to in a true hero-worshiping attitude by all who either know him or\nhear of his fame. Life in such a place is one long state of harmless\ninactivity. Not a wave of trouble from the great outer world ever\ndisturbs its peaceful repose. One lounges forever in an air of\nindolent ease and extreme aversion to anything approaching what might\nbe called a respectable effort.\n\nOne arises in the morning about the time the sun's first rays silver\nthe top leaves of the cocoanut trees and then stirs around until nine\nor ten o'clock, when it is found expedient to avoid a further exposure\nto the sun. From then until about five o'clock in the afternoon it is\nbest to take things as they come, even though one of those things be a\nFilipino dinner. But then you may have your vehiclo attached to a\nyoung bull with a ring in his nose and go for a drive. If it is the\ndry season you will probably enjoy the drive unless you object to the\nfrequent clouds of dust swept along by the evening wind. If it is in\nthe rainy season your pleasure will depend to a considerable extent\nupon how wet you get; but, whether the season be wet or dry, your\npleasure will be regulated largely by the state of harmony existing\nbetween the driver and the bull.\n\nIn these quiet secluded nooks successive generations of Filipinos are\nborn, reared, grow old and die in an even chain of events broken only\nby the occasional erection of a new grass house on the identical spot\nwhere its predecessors have stood for ages. The son lives in the house\nof his father, cultivates the same few square feet of soil planted in\nedible roots, climbs the same cocoanut trees, follows the same winding\npath down to the stream, pounds rice in the same mortar and with the\nsame stick that his ancestors have used from time unremembered, and,\nin case of illness, curls up on a grass mat in a corner of the room\nuntil he dies or by some good fortune recovers. Beyond this narrow\nhorizon he never looks. So narrow and contracted is the life that the\nlanguages of two towns a few miles apart are so different that one\nwould scarcely recognize them as belonging to the same race of people.\n\nSuch are the two extremes of life in our new far Eastern provinces:\nthe one is active, progressive, and cosmopolitan; the other, inactive,\ndecadent, and narrow; but, whether one enjoys the first or endures the\nsecond, there comes to him after leaving a longing to lounge again in\ntropic airs and listen to the lullaby of the winds among the palms.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VII. - THE FILIPINO AT HOME.\n\n\nAs one enters a Filipino sitting-room for the first time, there is one\nfeature in the arrangement of the furniture that impresses itself upon\nhim at once, and it may be stated without fear of serious\ncontradiction that this same peculiar feature in its arrangement will\ncontinue to face him, as he enters different homes, about as certainly\nas he crosses the threshold.\n\nThe arrangement referred to is that of one large mirror, one settee,\nand some ten or a dozen chairs that appear to have had a certain\norderly affection for one another. The mirror is hung upon one of the\nlarge interior parts of the house about four feet above the floor. The\nwooden houses in the Philippines are built by setting large posts\nupright into the ground, extending into the air from twenty to thirty\nfeet. Cross timbers are fastened to these upright posts about eight or\nten feet above the ground and then not sawed off even with the posts,\nbut allowed to extend beyond them each way. The framework of the house\nis built upon these extending cross timbers, a style of building by\nwhich these large upright posts are left standing out on the inside of\nthe room from one to three feet from the walls. It is on that one of\nthese posts most nearly opposite the door that the mirror always finds\nits place. Immediately beneath the mirror is the settee; and the\nchairs are arranged in two parallel lines facing one another and at\nright angles with the ends of the settee. However odd this arrangement\nmay appear to one when he first enters a Filipino drawing-room, there\nare two things to be said in its favor. In the first place, it places\nyou face to face with the person with whom you are conversing so that\nyou can watch him,--a matter of no small moment in the Philippines. In\nthe next place, it enables you to give one of the young ladies a\nsheep's-eye in the mirror while the others present are left where\nMoses was in our much abused conundrum.\n\nThe size of the residence and the quality of its furnishings depends\nupon the wealth of the owner. But there is so vast a difference\nbetween the mode of life of the highest class and the tao, or lowest\nclass, that it is well to speak of them separately, and the great\nmiddle class of Filipinos can easily be imagined to occupy the\nintervening ground.\n\nThe rich Filipino's house is usually of wood built upon a wall of\nstone or brick from ten to fifteen feet high. The floors are kept\nhighly polished in his hallway, dressing-room, and bed-rooms. There\nare, of course, no fire-places in any of the rooms, but on some\noccasions something is needed to dry the rain-soaked atmosphere, for\neven in the dry season it has been seen to rain for five successive\ndays and nights without the cessation of a moment.\n\nA long chain of dependents is attached to the household of the rich\nFilipino. The master has his special body servant to be present at all\ntimes to do his master's bidding, in short, to be the visible\nmechanism of his master's volition. So, too, the lady of the house has\nher servant woman to do the slightest bidding of her ladyship. Then\nthere is the cook who is almost invariably a man, a house boy or two,\nand the coachman. These functionaries, with their assistants and\nassistants to the assistants, together with a servant or two for the\nexclusive service of the children, complete the economic household.\n\nSuch a family has an abundance of rice and wheat bread, also of\nchicken and fish with occasional fresh beef. They have also a good\ndeal of dulce. They regularly serve wine and frequently serve beer\non their tables.\n\nIn strong contrast with this mode of life is that of the tao. His\ndiet consists almost wholly of rice and small uncleaned fish boiled\ntogether. As a rule knife, fork, plate, and spoon find no place in his\nhousehold. The rice and fish are boiled in a pot and then allowed to\ncool in the same vessel or poured out to cool in a large earthen or\nwooden bowl. Then Mr. Tao together with Mrs. Tao and all the young\nTaos squat on their heels around the mixture and satisfy that\nintangible thing called the appetite. They do not use chop sticks as\nthe Chinese do, but the rice and fish are caught in a hollow formed by\nthe first three fingers of the right hand. The thumb is then placed\nbehind the mass. It is raised up and poised before the mouth, with a\nskill coming from the evolution of ages, when a contraction of the\nmuscles of the thumb throws the mass into the mouth with a skill that\nis marvelous to any but a Filipino. To judge from the most reliable\ninformation, the poorest class do not have an abundance of food,\nalthough it would seem that such a condition of things would be\nwell-nigh impossible. However, in a census of one hundred school\nchildren there were found six boys and four girls who declared that\nthey had never had enough to eat, and the native teacher stated that\nthis was probably true.\n\nThe wide gulf between the tao and the rich man is filled by the\ngreat middle class of Filipinos.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VIII. - VISIT TO A LEPER COLONY.\n\n\nNot far from our town was a leper colony and the first Saturday that\ncould be spared was set aside for a trip to the place. It happened\nthat none of the other Americans were at leisure on this particular\nmorning, but, rather then delay the trip or miss it altogether, the\nwriter, armed with a revolver, started out alone.\n\nThe road had been described so accurately by one who was supposed to\nknow it that it was deemed well-nigh impossible to miss the way. The\nmain highway was followed to the point where the by-path supposed to\nlead to the settlement turned off through some bamboo thickets and a\nlow tropical wood. This path led straight away towards the sea-coast\nwhere the houses of the colony were said to stand in a cocoanut grove\nby the beach.\n\nUpon arriving at the settlement, a very inhospitable reception was\nreceived from a mangy cur that growled and showed a very uninviting\nset of sharp, white teeth behind his snarling lips. The growling of\nthe dog had attracted the attention of an old man who, with age-bent\nback, was pounding rice in a mortar about fifty yards away. He turned\nslowly around and, upon seeing an intruder into the primitive quiet of\nthe place, gave a sharp, far-reaching call. The sound had scarcely\nrung through the grove when from about a dozen of the little grass\nhouses dotted here and there fifteen or twenty men armed with bolos\ncame out and gathered around the old man. A sense of my danger flashed\nupon me. Three miles from town and alone in a tropical jungle, I could\nbe almost instantly overcome by this band of bolo-men, and the only\nreport that would ever reach my people would be that I had\n\"disappeared.\" Of course, attack was by no means certain, but the\npotentiality of the situation was thrilling. A drawn revolver and the\ngleaming of its shining barrel had the effect of stopping the men, who\nseemed to be hesitating as to a course of action, until a somewhat\ndignified retreat was made to an open space in the rear from where a\nless dignified and a more hasty retreat began which did not stop short\nof Bacalod.\n\nEnough had been seen, however, even in this short visit, to give\nconvincing proof that the settlement visited was no colony of lepers;\nso, that afternoon two servant boys being taken as guides and\ninterpreters, another attempt was made to reach the goal desired.\n\nThis attempt was successful, and, after about two hours of walking, a\nlittle cluster of grass huts snugly hidden by the sea-coast came into\nview. As we approached, one would have thought it a gala-day. Some few\nchildren, apparently from six to thirteen years of age, almost wholly\nnude, were romping and playing in the open space around which the huts\nstood, and no one would ever have thought that any cloud so horrible\nas leprosy could hover over a place apparently so happy.\n\nBy the side of the path as we passed was a man and his wife setting\nout potato plants. His hands were so puffed and his fingers so short\nthat he could scarcely use them, but he was working along as best he\ncould. His wife's feet were so swollen and twisted that she walked\nonly with the greatest difficulty. We passed them by and entered the\nopen space above referred to.\n\nThe children now saw us, and those of them who could darted away like\nfrightened rabbits, each to his own burrow. An old man who was sitting\nin the warm afternoon sun on the little bamboo platform before his hut\nwas aroused from his lethargic repose by the scampering away of the\nchildren. He arose, trembling upon his tottering limbs, all drawn and\ntwisted, and hobbled away into his hut.\n\nThe children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at\nthe doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of\nthe settlement. In a few moments we were surrounded by a circle of\nhuman beings at once so repulsive and so pitiable that its graphic\nvividness can never be accurately portrayed.\n\nThe old man referred to above, having put on a pair of snow-white\npantaloons, appeared now at the doorway of his hut, followed a few\nmoments later by his wife who had evidently clothed herself in the\nbest raiment she had. At a call from the old man, all the men, women,\nand children in the settlement came out of their huts and stood in a\nline before us. The old man was spokesman and in his native visayan\ntongue made a heart-rending appeal for aid which we were powerless to\ngive. Attention was called to a leper woman, apparently about\ntwenty-five years of age, whose face had been attacked by the disease\nand whose appearance was truly pathetic. Upon her hip was a child\nabout a year and a half old and, strange to say, the child showed as\nyet no signs whatever of the disease.\n\nWhat an indissoluble enigma is life! Here in a little cluster of grass\nhuts in a secluded nook of a secluded island of an all but secluded\narchipelago was gathered together a little community of wretched\nnatives, driven by their loathsomeness from association with others\neven of the same half-savage race. Yet here, men and women loved and\nwere married, by mutual trust if not by law, and children were born of\nthe union to live forever under the unspeakable horror that\novershadowed the unfortunate parents. Love, hatred, sorrow, and\njoy--every passion that enters into the complex structure of the human\nheart even here, in this scene of sadness and despair, was playing\napparently as freely as where misfortune and disease had never crossed\nthe portals of life.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER IX. - A \"HIKE.\"\n\n\nWe were lounging lazily in our hammocks at Jimamaylan one evening in\nApril. Supper was just ended, and the soldiers in the post were\ncollected in groups here and there spinning yarns to pass away the\ntime, when a Filipino clad only in a loin cloth came down the street\nat a steadily swinging run and stopped in front of the sentry. He\nbrought the announcement that a band of ladrones had just burned a\nsugar mill and were advancing to sack a barrio about fifteen miles\naway.\n\nThe invitation of the commanding officer to go on a \"hike\" was eagerly\naccepted, and, in ten minutes after the message was given, the troops\nwere on the march followed by two adventurous pedagogues.\n\nDarkness was just closing in as we left the town, but a resplendent\ntropic moon soon made the night almost as brilliant as the day. The\ntrail we followed led over rough and rocky country. Sometimes for a\ndistance of a mile or more we passed over barren wastes of volcanic\nslag poured out in anger by some peak whose convulsions have long\nsince ceased. Again we would descend into a tropical jungle from the\ndense foliage of which the ladrones could have leaped at any moment,\nhad they known of our coming, and annihilated our little band. We\nforded rapid streams with the water at our breasts, and halted only\nonce in that rapid march of fifteen miles.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the town we met a man who was standing\nguard against a surprise by the ladrones. Nothing could well have been\nmuch more grotesque and nothing could much better illustrate the\nabsolutely primitive condition of the Filipinos in the interior of the\nislands than the appearance of this guard. A pair of knee pants, a\nconical grass hat, and a hemp shirt formed his entire apparel. A long\nflat wooden shield, a bolo, and a long bamboo spear with a sharp,\nflat, iron point, completed his equipment for battle.\n\nHere stood the first and the twentieth centuries side by side. The\nFilipino who had advanced only a stage beyond the condition of\nprimitive man with his knife, spear, and wooden shield, stood side by\nside with the American soldier, a representative of modern life with\nhis magazine rifle, his canteen, his knapsack,--with every article of\nhis clothing made to give him the highest possible efficiency as the\nunit of a military organization.\n\nA few yards farther on we met another guard equipped similarly to the\nfirst. Upon reaching the town, news had just been received that a\ndetachment of troops from another post had intercepted the ladrones\nand fought a skirmish with them. The ladrones had escaped and we set\nout in pursuit of them on a chase wilder than a Quixotic dream. We\nwound our way into the mountains behind the town, inquiring at every\ngrass hut we passed whether the band of ladrones had passed that way,\nbut only once was even a trace of them found. Then it was learned that\nat a certain place they had separated into groups of three or four and\ngone glimmering through the dream of things that were. This place was\nin a secluded nook of the mountains where in years gone by some\nadventurous Spaniard had erected a primitive water mill to grind his\nsugar-cane. We had now marched about twenty miles and the feet of the\npedagogues were a mass of blisters. They had reached the point where\nthat form of military maneuvering called \"hiking\" ceased to possess\nany alluring charms. So a native was persuaded to come out of his lone\nmountain hut and hitch up his carabao and cart. He was then made to\nget on the carabao's back, while the aforesaid pedagogues lay down on\nthe sugar-cane pulp that had been put into the body of the cart, and\nthe driver was instructed to start for the post we had left hours\nbefore, and not to stop until he got there. Being uncertain but that\nsome of the ladrones would learn of our having left the body of troops\nand would try the metal of our steel, we at first agreed that neither\nof us should go to sleep, but it was later decided that probably the\ndriver had no greater desire to cross the Styx than his passengers had\nand that in case of danger he would awaken us, so both took a revolver\nin each hand, stretched out supinely and went to sleep.\n\nSuch a sleep! The rough jolting of the cart over an almost impassable\nroad was never enough to break the spell of slumber. When we awoke the\nblazing tropic sun was past the midday mark of morning, shining full\ninto our unprotected and well-nigh blistered faces.\n\nA pack of dogs were heralding our approach to a little village at the\nfoot of the mountains where ponies were procured to take us back to\nthe post."

                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently\nno time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth dimension of Space\nas a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house\nbecame quite quiet.\n\nOn reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up\nagainst a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realize\nhis position. Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\nhundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the\nDowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone\ninto hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains on\none of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who\nhad been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr\nto nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair\nby the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six\nweeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become\nreconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that\nnotorious sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible\nnight when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his\ndressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and\nconfessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox\nout of \u00a350,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card, and swore that\nthe ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back\nto him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because\nhe had seen a green hand tapping at the window-pane, to the beautiful\nLady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round\nher throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin,\nand who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of the\nKing's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he went\nover his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as\nhe recalled to mind his last appearance as \"Red Reuben, or the Strangled\nBabe,\" his d\u00e9but as \"Guant Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,\"\n\nand the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely\nplaying ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And\nafter all this some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him\nthe Rising Sun Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite\nunbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever been treated in this\nmanner. Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance, and remained till\ndaylight in an attitude of deep thought.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III\n\n\nThe next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed\nthe ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. \"I have\nno wish,\" he said, \"to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say\nthat, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,\"--a very just remark,\nat which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.\n\n\"Upon the other hand,\" he continued, \"if he really declines to use the\nRising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him. It\nwould be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside\nthe bedrooms.\"\n\nFor the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the\nblood-stain on the library floor. This certainly was very strange, as\nthe door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept\nclosely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a\ngood deal of comment. Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red,\nthen it would be vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came\ndown for family prayers, according to the simple rites of the Free\nAmerican Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright\nemerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party\nvery much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening. The\nonly person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia, who,\nfor some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the\nsight of the blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was\nemerald-green.\n\nThe second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in\nthe hall. Rushing down-stairs, they found that a large suit of old\narmour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone\nfloor, while seated in a high-backed chair was the Canterville ghost,\nrubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face. The\ntwins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged\ntwo pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained\nby long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United\nStates Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in\naccordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost\nstarted up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a\nmist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so\nleaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase\nhe recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of\ndemoniac laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely\nuseful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single\nnight, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French\ngovernesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly\nlaughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and\nrang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door\nopened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown. \"I am\nafraid you are far from well,\" she said, \"and have brought you a bottle\nof Doctor Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a\nmost excellent remedy.\" The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at\nonce to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an\naccomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family\ndoctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's\nuncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps,\nhowever, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself\nwith becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep\nchurchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.\n\nOn reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the\nmost violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross\nmaterialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what\nreally distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit\nof mail. He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by\nthe sight of a Spectre in armour, if for no more sensible reason, at\nleast out of respect for their natural poet Longfellow, over whose\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\nhour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides it was his own suit.\n\nHe had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament, and had\nbeen highly complimented on it by no less a person than the Virgin Queen\nherself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely overpowered\nby the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen\nheavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees severely, and\nbruising the knuckles of his right hand.\n\nFor some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of\nhis room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.\n\nHowever, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to\nmake a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his\nfamily. He selected Friday, August 17th, for his appearance, and spent\nmost of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in\nfavour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet\nfrilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards evening a\nviolent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was\njust such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to\nmake his way quietly to Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the\nfoot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\nof low music. He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville\nblood-stain by means of Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent. Having reduced\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and\nhis wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead,\nwhile he hissed into her trembling husband's ear the awful secrets of\nthe charnel-house. With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made\nup his mind. She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and\ngentle. A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more\nthan sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the\ncounterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins, he was quite\ndetermined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be done was, of\ncourse, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling\nsensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each\nother, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse,\ntill they became paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw off the\nwinding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white, bleached bones and\none rolling eyeball, in the character of \"Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's\nSkeleton,\" a r\u00f4le in which he had on more than one occasion produced a\ngreat effect, and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of\n\"Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.\"\n\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the\nlight-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves\nbefore they retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still,\nand, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the\nwindow-panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family\nslept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\ncould hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States. He\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his\nmurdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like\nan evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.\n\nOnce he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only\nthe baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange\nsixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\nin the midnight air. Finally he reached the corner of the passage that\nled to luckless Washington's room. For a moment he paused there, the\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's\nshroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was\ncome. He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had\nhe done so than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid\nhis blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was\nstanding a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous\nas a madman's dream! Its head was bald and burnished; its face round,\nand fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\nfeatures into an eternal grin. From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\nlight, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like\nto his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form. On its breast\nwas a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of\nshame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime,\nand, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\n\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's\njack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler. Once in the\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small\npallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes. After a time, however,\nthe brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to\ngo and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight. Accordingly,\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling\nthat, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid\nof his new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins. On reaching\nthe spot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had\nevidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from\nits hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it\nwas leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable\nattitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his\nhorror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a\nrecumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity\nbed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow\nturnip lying at his feet! Unable to understand this curious\ntransformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there,\nin the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:--\n        +------------------------------------+\n        |         YE OTIS GHOSTE             |\n        | Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook, |\n        |    Beware of Ye Imitationes.       |\n        |   All others are counterfeite.     |\n        +------------------------------------+\nThe whole thing flashed across him. He had been tricked, foiled, and\nout-witted! The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his\ntoothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his\nhead, swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\nschool, that, when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds\nof blood would be wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.\n\nHardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of\na distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh,\nand waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\nreason, did not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back\nto his room, thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose. There he\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was\nexceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which this oath\nhad been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second time. \"Perdition\nseize the naughty fowl,\" he muttered, \"I have seen the day when, with my\nstout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow\nfor me an 'twere in death!\" He then retired to a comfortable lead\ncoffin, and stayed there till evening.\n\n\nCHAPTER: IV\n\n\nThe next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were\ncompletely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five\ndays he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point\nof the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want\nit, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a\nlow, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating\nthe symbolic value of sensuous phenomena. The question of phantasmic\napparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a\ndifferent matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large\noriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every month, and he\ndid not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is\nquite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand,\nhe was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.\n\nFor the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as\nusual between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible\nprecaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots,\ntrod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large\nblack velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for\noiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good\ndeal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of\nprotection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he\nslipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a\nlittle humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see\nthat there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a\ncertain degree, it served his purpose. Still in spite of everything he\nwas not left unmolested. Strings were continually being stretched across\nthe corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion,\nwhile dressed for the part of \"Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley\nWoods,\" he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide,\nwhich the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry\nChamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged\nhim, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and\nsocial position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the\nnext night in his celebrated character of \"Reckless Rupert, or the\nHeadless Earl.\"\n\nHe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in\nfact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means\nof it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord\nCanterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome\nJack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\ndown the terrace at twilight. Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\nLord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken\nheart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it\nhad been a great success. It was, however an extremely difficult\n\"make-up,\" if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more\nscientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three\nhours to make his preparations. At last everything was ready, and he was\nvery pleased with his appearance. The big leather riding-boots that went\nwith the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\nfind one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite\nsatisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting\nand crept down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins,\nwhich I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of\nthe colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make\nan effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water\nfell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his\nleft shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed. The shock to his\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\ncould go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold. The only\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\nhad not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences\nmight have been very serious.\n\nHe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,\nand contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in\nlist slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\ndraughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the\ntwins. The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September. He\nhad gone down-stairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that\nthere, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing\nhimself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of\nthe United States Minister and his wife which had now taken the place of\nthe Canterville family pictures. He was simply but neatly clad in a long\nshroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip\nof yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In\nfact, he was dressed for the character of \"Jonas the Graveless, or the\nCorpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,\" one of his most remarkable\nimpersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to\nremember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their\nneighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a quarter-past two o'clock in\nthe morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring. As\nhe was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any\ntraces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a\ndark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads,\nand shrieked out \"BOO!\" in his ear.\n\nSeized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural,\nhe rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him\nthere with the big garden-syringe, and being thus hemmed in by his\nenemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the\ngreat iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to\nmake his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own\nroom in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.\n\nAfter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins\nlay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\nservants, but it was of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings\nwere so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed\nhis great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had\nbeen engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized a wonderful\nclam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse\neuchre, poker, and other American national games, and Virginia rode\nabout the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire,\nwho had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville\nChase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in\nfact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who,\nin reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best\ncongratulations to the Minister's worthy wife.\n\nThe Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the\nhouse, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let\nmatters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the\nyoung Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had\nonce bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice\nwith the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the\nfloor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state that, though\nhe lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but\n\"Double Sixes.\" The story was well known at the time, though, of course,\nout of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt\nwas made to hush it up, and a full account of all the circumstances\nconnected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle's\nRecollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends. The ghost, then,\nwas naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence\nover the Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his\nown first cousin having been married en secondes noces to the Sieur de\nBulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are\nlineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to\nVirginia's little lover in his celebrated impersonation of \"The Vampire\nMonk, or the Bloodless Benedictine,\" a performance so horrible that when\nold Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in\nthe year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which\nculminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after\ndisinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and\nleaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment,\nhowever, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the\nlittle Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal\nBedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.\n\n\nCHAPTER: V\n\n\nA few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out\nriding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting\nthrough a hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go\nup by the back staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past\nthe Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied\nshe saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother's maid, who\nsometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend\nher habit. To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville\nGhost himself! He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of\nthe yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing\nmadly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his hand, and his\nwhole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so forlorn, and so\nmuch out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea\nhad been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity,\nand determined to try and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so\ndeep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she\nspoke to him.\n\n\"I am so sorry for you,\" she said, \"but my brothers are going back to\nEton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy\nyou.\"\n\n\"It is absurd asking me to behave myself,\" he answered, looking round in\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,\n\"quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and\nwalk about at night, if that is what you mean. It is my only reason for\nexisting.\"\n\n\"It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very\nwicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had\nkilled your wife.\"\n\n\"Well, I quite admit it,\" said the Ghost, petulantly, \"but it was a\npurely family matter, and concerned no one else.\"\n\n\"It is very wrong to kill any one,\" said Virginia, who at times had a\nsweet puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.\n\n\"Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very\nplain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about\ncookery. Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent\npricket, and do you know how she had it sent to table? However, it is\nno matter now, for it is all over, and I don't think it was very nice of\nher brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.\"\n\n\"Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost--I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry? I\nhave a sandwich in my case. Would you like it?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you,\nall the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\nvulgar, dishonest family.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Virginia, stamping her foot, \"it is you who are rude, and\nhorrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the\npaints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain\nin the library. First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and\nI couldn't do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the\nchrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese\nwhite, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing\nto look at, and not at all easy to paint. I never told on you, though I\nwas very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for\nwho ever heard of emerald-green blood?\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" said the Ghost, rather meekly, \"what was I to do? It is\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother\nbegan it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I\nshould not have your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of\ntaste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest\nin England; but I know you Americans don't care for things of this\nkind.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\nand improve your mind. My father will be only too happy to give you a\nfree passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind,\nthere will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are\nall Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\nhave a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family ghost.\"\n\n\"I don't think I should like America.\"\n\n\"I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,\" said Virginia,\nsatirically.\n\n\"No ruins! no curiosities!\" answered the Ghost; \"you have your navy and\nyour manners.\"\n\n\"Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week's\nholiday.\"\n\n\"Please don't go, Miss Virginia,\" he cried; \"I am so lonely and so\nunhappy, and I really don't know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I\ncannot.\"\n\n\"That's quite absurd! You have merely to go to bed and blow out the\ncandle. It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\nchurch, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why, even\nbabies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.\"\n\n\"I have not slept for three hundred years,\" he said sadly, and\nVirginia's beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; \"for three hundred\nyears I have not slept, and I am so tired.\"\n\nVirginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like\nrose-leaves. She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked\nup into his old withered face.\n\n\"Poor, poor Ghost,\" she murmured; \"have you no place where you can\nsleep?\"\n\n\"Far away beyond the pine-woods,\" he answered, in a low, dreamy voice,\n\"there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\nsings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold crystal\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\nsleepers.\"\n\nVirginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\n\n\"You mean the Garden of Death,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth,\nwith the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have\nno yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at\npeace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of death's\nhouse, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death\nis.\"\n\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\nthere was silence. She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\n\nThen the ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of\nthe wind.\n\n\"Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?\"\n\n\"Oh, often,\" cried the little girl, looking up; \"I know it quite well.\n\nIt is painted in curious black letters, and is difficult to read. There\nare only six lines:\n    \"'When a golden girl can win\n    Prayer from out the lips of sin,\n    When the barren almond bears,\n    And a little child gives away its tears,\n    Then shall all the house be still\n    And peace come to Canterville.'\n\n\"But I don't know what they mean.\"\n\n\"They mean,\" he said, sadly, \"that you must weep with me for my sins,\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle,\nthe angel of death will have mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\ncannot prevail.\"\n\nVirginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair\nas he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes. \"I am not afraid,\" she said\nfirmly, \"and I will ask the angel to have mercy on you.\"\n\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as\nhe led her across the dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were\nbroidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back. \"Go back! little Virginia,\"\n\nthey cried, \"go back!\" but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly,\nand she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails\nand goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and\nmurmured, \"Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,\"\n\nbut the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When\nthey reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she\ncould not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly\nfading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A\nbitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her\ndress. \"Quick, quick,\" cried the Ghost, \"or it will be too late,\" and\nin a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry\nChamber was empty.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VI\n\n\nAbout ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not\ncome down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia\nanywhere. As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\nevening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all\nalarmed at first, but when six o'clock struck, and Virginia did not\nappear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for\nher, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house. At\nhalf-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\nof their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of\nexcitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly\nremembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies\npermission to camp in the park. He accordingly at once set off for\nBlackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son\nand two of the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire, who was\nperfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too,\nbut Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a\nscuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gipsies had\ngone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as\nthe fire was still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.\n\nHaving sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran\nhome, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the\ncounty, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been\nkidnapped by tramps or gipsies. He then ordered his horse to be brought\nround, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down\nto dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with a groom. He had hardly,\nhowever, gone a couple of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after\nhim, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with\nhis face very flushed, and no hat. \"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,\" gasped\nout the boy, \"but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.\n\nPlease don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year,\nthere would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me back,\nwill you? I can't go! I won't go!\"\n\nThe Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace,\nand was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down\nfrom his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, \"Well,\nCecil, if you won't go back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must\nget you a hat at Ascot.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!\" cried the little Duke, laughing,\nand they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of\nthe station-master if any one answering to the description of Virginia\nhad been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her. The\nstation-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him\nthat a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a\nhat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his\nshutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away,\nwhich he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as there was a\nlarge common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman, but\ncould get no information from him, and, after riding all over the\ncommon, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase\nabout eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found\nWashington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with\nlanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest trace of\nVirginia had been discovered. The gipsies had been caught on Brockley\nmeadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they should be late. Indeed, they had\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's disappearance, as they\nwere very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his\npark, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search.\n\nThe carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone\nover, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any\nrate, Virginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest\ndepression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they\nfound a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\nwas poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and\nhaving her forehead bathed with eau de cologne by the old housekeeper.\n\nMr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up\nsupper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one\nspoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very\nfond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the\nentreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that\nnothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in\nthe morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down\nimmediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight\nbegan to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded\nthey heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder\nshook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a\npanel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out\non the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her\nhand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs.\nOtis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with\nviolent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.\n\n\"Good heavens! child, where have you been?\" said Mr. Otis, rather\nangrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them.\n\n\"Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and\nyour mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these\npractical jokes any more.\"\n\n\"Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!\" shrieked the twins, as they\ncapered about.\n\n\"My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side\nagain,\" murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair.\n\n\"Papa,\" said Virginia, quietly, \"I have been with the Ghost. He is dead,\nand you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was\nreally sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of\nbeautiful jewels before he died.\"\n\nThe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave\nand serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a\nlighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they\ncame to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia\ntouched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves\nin a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated\nwindow. Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was\na gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone\nfloor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers\nan old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its\nreach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was\ncovered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but\na pile of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding\nher little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the\nparty looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\ndisclosed to them.\n\n\"Hallo!\" suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out\nof the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\nsituated. \"Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.\"\n\n\"God has forgiven him,\" said Virginia, gravely, as she rose to her feet,\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.\n\n\"What an angel you are!\" cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round\nher neck, and kissed her.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VII\n\n\nFour days after these curious incidents, a funeral started from\nCanterville Chase at about eleven o'clock at night. The hearse was drawn\nby eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\nnodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\npurple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville\ncoat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\nservants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully\nimpressive. Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up\nspecially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first\ncarriage along with little Virginia. Then came the United States\nMinister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the\nlast carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had\nbeen frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she\nhad a right to see the last of him. A deep grave had been dug in the\ncorner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service\nwas read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, the servants, according to an old custom\nobserved in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as\nthe coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward,\nand laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms. As\nshe did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its\nsilent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a\nnightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of the\nGarden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a\nword during the drive home.\n\nThe next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given\nto Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby\nnecklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen\nof sixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis\nfelt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"I know that in this country mortmain is held to\napply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that\nthese jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg\nyou, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you\nunder certain strange conditions. As for my daughter, she is merely a\nchild, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such\nappurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I\nmay say, is no mean authority upon Art,--having had the privilege of\nspending several winters in Boston when she was a girl,--that these gems\nare of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\nprice. Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you\nwill recognize how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\nin the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such\nvain gauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\nBritish aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who\nhave been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles\nof Republican simplicity. Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box, as a memento of\nyour unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is extremely old, and\nconsequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to\ncomply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good deal\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with medi\u00e6valism\nin any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was\nborn in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned\nfrom a trip to Athens.\"\n\nLord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister's speech,\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile,\nand when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\nsaid: \"My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky\nancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are\nmuch indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck. The jewels\nare clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough\nto take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave\nin a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. As for their being\nheirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or\nlegal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite\nunknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and\nwhen Miss Virginia grows up, I dare say she will be pleased to have\npretty things to wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the\nfurniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to\nthe ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity\nSir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he\nwas really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase.\"\n\nMr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville's refusal, and\nbegged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was\nquite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to\nretain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of\n1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's first\ndrawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the\nuniversal theme of admiration. For Virginia received the coronet, which\nis the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her\nboy-lover as soon as he came of age. They were both so charming, and\nthey loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the\nmatch, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch\nthe Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less\nthan three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to\nsay, Mr. Otis himself. Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke\npersonally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his\nown words, \"was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating\ninfluences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of\nRepublican simplicity should be forgotten.\" His objections, however,\nwere completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the\naisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his\narm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of\nEngland.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to\nCanterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over\nin the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods. There had\nbeen a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir\nSimon's tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it\nsimply the initials of the old gentleman's name, and the verse from the\nlibrary window. The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses,\nwhich she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for\nsome time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There\nthe Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her\nfeet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly\nhe threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her,\n\"Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.\"\n\n\"Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have,\" he answered, smiling, \"you have never told me what\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.\"\n\n\"I have never told any one, Cecil,\" said Virginia, gravely.\n\n\"I know that, but you might tell me.\"\n\n\"Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you. Poor Sir Simon! I owe\nhim a great deal. Yes, don't laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see\nwhat Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than\nboth.\"\n\nThe Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.\n\n\"You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,\" he murmured.\n\n\"You have always had that, Cecil.\"\n\n\"And you will tell our children some day, won't you?\"\n\nVirginia blushed.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.\n\nYet Millet would have us understand that in spite of this, the\nshepherd is performing a duty to humanity not to be underrated. The\nsheep he has so carefully and conscientiously reared will form food\nto-morrow for many a hungry town-dweller. Further, he would have us\nfollow the peasant as he closes the pen for the night and traces his\ntired steps towards his simple home in the village. The frugal and\nhard-earned meal, prepared for him by his wife, who like himself has\nhad her share of duties to occupy her during the day, is partaken of\nsurrounded by a hungry and joyous group of children. Such themes\nsuggested by the simplicity of his own life appealed to him with\nirresistible force, and it is in their portrayal that his greatness is\nmanifested.\n\nPerhaps no season of the year presented the same attraction for Millet\nas the spring. The period when all the earth after its long winter\nsleep is about to waken into new life seems to have always been a\nsource of inspiration to him. In \"The Sower\" he emphasises the fact\nthat the fruits of the harvest are not to be had without due labour\nbeing expended upon the earth. The sloping field, barren of\nvegetation, and crowned at the top with a small clump of trees, is\nbeing broken up by the distant plough drawn by two horses and guided\nby a peasant. The latter figure is one of the noblest of Millet's\ncreations. By his strained and ever-attentive attitude, by his\ncontinuous tramp over the rough and broken ground, he shows us the\nmonotony of his toil. He crosses the field in one direction, only to\nreturn at an interval of a few feet. In the foreground we have the\nsower, a middle-aged man of typical peasant type, on whose left side a\nbag of seeds is slung. With automatic precision he withdraws a\nhandful, and strews it into the furrows open to receive it. So long as\nhe continues in the same track his labour will be well performed, and\nhence his task is just as monotonous as that of his fellow-worker\nhigher up in the field. The silhouetting of these two figures against\nthe light is symbolical of the labour to be expended in life before\nresults are forthcoming.\n\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that in considering the works of\nMillet, one must not judge him from the standpoint of a mere painter.\n\nHis brush is only the means to an end, and by its means he is enabled\nto bring the fruits of his philosophic observation before us in\npermanent form. It has been charged against the \"Angelus\" that it was\nnot a remarkably fine piece of painting, that many a young artist of\nthe present generation is infinitely better equipped, technically\nspeaking, than the master who wrought this celebrated canvas. This may\nin a measure be true, but it must never be forgotten that Millet\nbrought into play exactly the means which could illustrate his meaning\nin the clearest terms. He had not intended, in painting such a\npicture, to produce a work which would astonish his fellow artists\nwith its brilliancy of handling or magnificence of colour. He wanted\nto make the beholder forget the painter and absorb the lesson. This\nquality runs right through the art of Millet, and it is from this\nstandpoint that we are obliged to weigh his merits.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE\n\n\nJean Fran\u00e7ois Millet was born on October 4, 1814, that is at the\nperiod when French art, at any rate as far as landscape painting is\nconcerned, had reached its lowest ebb. Throughout the eighteenth\ncentury the landscape painter had been hard put to make a living. The\ntaste of connoisseurs throughout the century had been for portraits\nand interiors, or for those numerous pastoral subjects which were\ncarried out with so much decorative charm by such men as Watteau and\nBoucher. Such landscape painting as existed was of the type\npopularised by Vernet; it was built upon a curious mixture of Italian\ninfluence coming from Panini and Salvator Rosa. The only evidence of\nrevolt against such a state of affairs we find in the works of Hubert\nRobert and Moreau. These two, and more especially would I direct the\nreader's attention to the latter, struggled hard to break down the\nconventionalities of the time. They endeavoured to infuse some sense\nof atmosphere into their pictures, and whilst frequently their trees\nand figures are painfully formal, they yet stand alone in the French\nschool as the pioneers of a phase of art which was to attain its\nzenith in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBut after the Revolution, and during the whole of the time that France\nwas under the domination of Napoleon, very rigid principles indeed\nwere enforced with regard to the direction that art should take. The\ninnovation which had its commencement in the reign of Louis XVI. swept\neverything before it as it gained force. Classical art and traditions\ndominated the whole French school, and no artist, however great his\nreputation, attempted for many years to swim against the stream. In\nspite of the principles of liberty and equality which were claimed for\nall under the new r\u00e9gime, a terribly strict eye was kept upon any\ninnovations which might break out in the form of a naturalistic art.\n\nThe directors of this new movement failed to see that the conditions\nwhich had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed\naway, and that the latter's supremacy was due to the fact that their\nproductions were symbolical of the loftiest thoughts of their own\nepoch. The art which expresses the ambitions and noblest thoughts of\nits time will alone endure. These expressions are not applicable to\nany other condition than those which called them forth, and hence in\nattempting to purify the rococo which had existed up to the middle of\nthe eighteenth century, by a return to classical traditions, they were\nonly copying that which their predecessors had done, and in so doing\nleft us without any original expression of their own time.\n\nInto such a condition of affairs was Millet born, and he was numbered\namongst that little band of men which included Rousseau, Corot, Dupr\u00e9,\nDiaz, and Daumier, who were to lay the foundations of the modern\nnaturalistic school. At the outset it was seemingly a hopeless\nstruggle they undertook; a struggle against prejudice and influence\nwhich was only to be brought to a victorious culmination after years\nof struggle and disappointment. Of this little band, Millet was\nperhaps the best equipped for the privations which were necessary. He\ncame of a peasant stock who inhabited Gruchy, a small village\nsituated in the commune of Gr\u00e9ville, close to Cherbourg. Grouped\nunderneath the humble roof was the grandmother, who had been left a\nwidow fifteen years before; her son, Jean Louis Nicolas Millet, and\nhis wife and eight children, of which our artist was the second. His\ngrandmother appears to have been a pious old lady, whose chief delight\nwas in her grandchildren, to whom she taught those religious\nprinciples which stood them in good stead in after life. We are told\nthat Millet's father possessed a force of character one does not often\nfind amongst men in his rank of life. He was of a contemplative\ndisposition, and had a keenly developed feeling for natural beauty. He\npossessed moreover a keen appreciation of music, which unfortunately\nhe does not appear to have had much opportunity of cultivating. His\nwife was an excellent housewife and of a religious turn of mind. The\nhouse they occupied, situated quite a short distance from the sea, was\nplaced in a tract of country which, whilst it had rugged and\npicturesque features, was not of a nature which would yield\nextraordinary results under cultivation. It was, therefore, a hard\nstruggle for existence which Millet in his first years saw going\non around him. Not that the family were any the less happy for having\nto work laboriously for their livelihood. They had been brought up\namidst such surroundings; their wants were simple and easily\ngratified, and the tranquillity of the m\u00e9nage more than\ncounterbalanced those doubtful luxuries which easier circumstances\nwould have brought their way. Throughout his life Millet maintained\nthe extreme simplicity he had seen practised in the home of his\nchildhood, and long years afterwards he was accustomed to look back\nwith pleasureable memories upon his early years.\n\nGruchy, situated in one of the wildest parts of Normandy, feels the\nfull effect of every storm which blows up from the Atlantic. There is\nnothing to shelter the exposed hamlets studded along the coast from\nthe fury of the western gale, and the rocks are but too often strewn\nwith the wrecks of vessels which have come to grief in that terrible\nsea. Millet in his youth must have witnessed many of these\ncatastrophes. Quite a number of drawings by him are extant\nrepresenting succour being extended to some vessel in difficulties, or\nthe hauling up of some wreckage on to the rocks. The studious boy\nmust have been impressed as he saw the sternness of the combat in his\nnative country between men and nature; the wind-swept fields, and\nhills bare to the point of savageness. The very trees themselves\ndwarfed and gnarled; in their struggle with the elements they have\nbeen made tough and hardy as the inhabitants of the country\nthemselves, and, stunted as they are, yet show well that they can\nresist the force of the fiercest storm. The brooding and contemplative\ncharacter of the father having descended to the son, we can quite\nimagine the effect such surroundings would have upon him. As he looked\nback in after years upon his roamings in his native country, he\nappreciated the awe-inspiring character of the scenery in which he had\nbeen born. He would doubtless recall many a walk amidst the fields\nwith the wind blowing in his face as it rushed in from the Atlantic,\nthe rain beating hard upon the freshly ploughed fields, and the\ndistant figure of the ploughman struggling hard with his team against\nthe stiff sou'wester. The great mass of vapour overhead whirled before\nthe violence of the storm, casting grey and pearly light over the\nwhole scene, whilst far away on the top of the hill a clump of trees,\nbent with their resistance to the wind, are silhouetted against the\nsky. Many a drawing of this kind we encounter in the later work of\nMillet, which shows how his thoughts harked back in certain moments to\nthe scenes he had left behind him for ever.\n\nWe know that on one or two occasions he returned to Gruchy. Once or\ntwice he had urgent business which took him back, but sometimes he\nwent with no other purpose than to renew acquaintance with the scenes\nof yore.\n\nLittle Jean Fran\u00e7ois was his grandmother's favourite. It was she who\ntaught him the names of things which surrounded him, and perhaps\ndirected his thoughts in the channels to which they were finally to be\ndevoted. Her brother Charles, who formed one of the family, used to\ntake him for walks, telling him stories on the way. Millet was\ndevotedly attached to this old man, and when at the age of seven years\nhe lost him, the gap in his life thus left made an impression upon his\nmemory never to be effaced.\n\nFive years afterwards he was placed in the hands of the vicar for the\npurpose of preparing him for his first communion. The good man seems\nto have been taken with the child; he found him so attentive to all\nnatural phenomenon which was passing around him and intelligent in an\nunusual degree. He quickly learnt a considerable amount of Latin,\nwhich introduced him to the great classics. Unfortunately for Millet,\nthe vicar accepted an offer of transference to a better parish in the\nvicinity. The boy had made such progress with his master that it was\ndecided that he should go with him to his new abode. He was, however,\nso missed in his own home, that when he came back for his first\nholidays it was decided that he should not return.\n\nHe now gave serious attention to the agricultural pursuits of his\nfather. He threw himself heartily into the work of the farm, and\nassisted in the work of sowing and harvesting, of pruning and\nthrashing according to the season. His spare time was occupied in\nreading with avidity various masterpieces of literature. The authors\nhe found at hand were such as F\u00e9n\u00e9lon and Bossuet, but he developed a\ndecided preference, which lasted till the end of his life, for Virgil\nand the Bible.\n\nIt was at this time that his taste for art began to be developed.\n\nHe drew the objects he found around him, and soon acquired sufficient\nconfidence in his skill to execute a large drawing representing two\nshepherds keeping guard over their sheep. These first efforts date\nfrom about his seventeenth year, and foretell the advent of the style\nin which he was later to become pre-eminent.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE MIGRATION TO PARIS\n\n\nHow frequently has it happened that the first years in the life of a\ngenius have been employed in labour quite different from that to which\nthey should have been directed. Such a state of affairs the more often\noccurs when the sense of duty has been strong enough to overcome\ntemporarily the inclination to pursue the natural bent. In the case of\nMillet, however, the early years which he devoted to the farm and its\npursuits were by no means wasted. It is on record that he became very\nproficient in the various duties in which he was engaged, but at the\nsame time we can be quite sure that his extraordinary faculties of\nobservation were constantly being brought into play, and the fruits of\nhis observations are to be seen in the pictures of his mature period.\n\nA considerable portion of his spare time was taken up with drawing,\nnot only the persons and objects he found around him, but also\nsubjects suggested to him by the books he was in the habit of reading.\n\nHis family, so far from throwing any obstacles in his way, encouraged\nhim. In fact it was his father who took him first to Cherbourg in\norder to show a painter of that town, named Mouchel, the early\nproducts of his son's genius. The decision at which Millet p\u00e8re had\narrived was prompted by a drawing in charcoal of an old peasant\nwalking along the road, which had struck him forcibly as being a work\nof extraordinary merit. It says much for Mouchel's breadth of mind\nthat he was equally impressed with the drawings. A man who had been\nbrought up in the school of David, and who had lived in one of the\nmost reactionary periods of French art, was hardly to be expected to\ntake kindly to a style so diametrically opposed to all the traditions\ninto which he himself had been inculcated; certainly the young\nMillet, who had now arrived at the age of eighteen, had not developed\nthe extraordinary freedom which his works of ten years later\ndemonstrate. But there was sufficient originality even in his early\ndrawings to call forth condemnation from a man who had been so\nsaturated with the teaching of David.\n\nHe prevailed upon Millet to leave his son with him, and set him to\nwork to copy many well-known works of art which he brought before his\npupil by means of engravings. Two months were spent in this way when\nnews reached Millet that his father had been seized with sudden\nillness, and he was obliged in the circumstances to return to\nGr\u00e9ville. He arrived to find the old man unconscious, and very shortly\nafterwards he died.\n\nThis misfortune awoke in Millet a sense of duty which compelled him to\ndesert his studies in Cherbourg and superintend the management of the\nfarm. For some time he devoted himself entirely to his new duties, but\nthe struggle betwixt duty and genius continued; he gave himself to his\nwork with all the energy at his disposal, but his thoughts were ever\nwandering to his art.\n\nAdded to his own inclinations, his grandmother, who perceived his\nextraordinary gifts, strongly persuaded him to devote his attention\nentirely to art, and consequently after some little time he decided to\nreturn to Cherbourg. Here he entered the studio of M. Langlois, an\nartist whose reputation in the town was considerable. Again in this\nworthy man he came in contact with a painter who had been brought up\nentirely under classical influence. Langlois, who had in his early\ndays been a pupil of Gros, had absorbed the classical tradition to\nsuch an extent as to be incapable of appreciating any other style. He\nappears to have endeavoured to mould Millet in his own method rather\nthan develop the latent genius which the latter possessed. The\nincompatibility of these two men speedily caused the younger to strike\nout in his own way. He saw more good in frequenting the museums and\nmaking copies of such works as appealed to him than in listening to\nthe advice of his teacher. All this occurred, however, without any\nbreach of friendship occurring. On the contrary, Langlois, after\nperceiving the futility of inducing his pupil to follow in his\nfootsteps, did all he could to advance his interests.\n\nBy means of his influence some of Millet's drawings were brought\nbefore the Municipal Council, and Langlois suggested that Millet\nshould be sent to Paris in order to further his development, and that\nthe Council should set aside a modest pension to meet his requirements\nin that city. The discussion appears to have been very prolonged, and\nupon the question being put to a vote it was only carried by means of\nthe casting vote of the mayor. Four hundred francs was at first\nallotted to him in this way, which was further increased shortly\nafterwards to six hundred. Such encouragement, meagre though it was,\nwas sufficient to give him a foothold in the metropolis. He left\nCherbourg in January 1837, on a cold and raw day, the snow falling\nheavily throughout the entire journey, and arrived in Paris in a very\ndisheartened condition. The miserable weather, coupled with the long\njourney in which he had had time to think of the small sum which lay\nbetween him and starvation, going to a city which he had never seen\nbefore, had all served to work upon his nerves, and he entered the\ngreat city sick at heart and very despondent.\n\nOne of the first visits he made after he was somewhat settled down in\nParis was to the Louvre. Here he was brought into contact for the\nfirst time with many masters, who were to mould his yet plastic\ntemperament into the form which enabled him to give to the world, in\nlater years, so many masterpieces. As I have said before, it was\nMantegna who first captivated him, and the influence of the mighty\nPaduan was never finally to be shaken off. Michel Angelo awed him with\nhis sublimity; his classical severity tempered with intense humanism,\nhis masculine strength, were bound to have their effect upon so\nserious a character as Millet. Strange as it may seem to those who are\nbut superficially acquainted with his art, and are only too apt to\njudge him by the influence he has had upon modern French painting, he\nwas fascinated with the antique. The traditions of Phidias and\nPraxiteles, in the form in which they had been transmitted through the\ngreatest minds of the Renaissance, were ever the factors which guided\nhim throughout his career. It was this same spirit which impelled his\nfervid admiration for Nicolas Poussin, a master who to-day is sadly\nunderrated and but little understood. It was the mysteries of line,\nthe wonders of pose and composition rather than the magic of colour\nwhich appealed to him. He had a profound admiration for the glowing\ncanvases of Titian and Rubens, but he could never overlook entirely\ntheir defects of drawing or, in the case of Rubens, the tendency to\nvulgarity. From his remarks in after years it would appear that he was\nbaffled with the mysticisms of Velazquez and Rembrandt; pure painting\nitself could never hold him. He needed to grasp the message which lay\nbehind it before he felt fully taken into the confidence of the\npainter; and as the minds of the Dutchman and the Spaniard ran in\nquite different channels to his own, they spoke with a language he\nnever understood. That he had a perceptive and critically independent\nmind may be gauged from his enthusiasm for Delacroix, whose work he\nencountered for the first time at the Luxembourg.\n\nDuring this period of study he was carefully considering under what\nmaster he should place himself. His choice unhappily fell upon\nDelaroche. To any one acquainted with the work of the latter master,\na more unsuitable selection could not have been made. Delaroche and\nthe painters who surrounded him can be appropriately described as\nconstituting the back-wash of the Empire style, which had reached its\nclimax with David. His subjects were always treated with academic\nreserve. No pyrotechnics were permitted; on the contrary, an\neverlasting and mistaken striving for finish was encouraged:\noriginality was sternly suppressed. To paint human life as it really\nwas, was too vulgar for any of the painters of this time. They held\nthe public taste enslaved for years. An innovator such as Millet was\ndestined to become found his position almost untenable. The band of\ncritics and painters formed a monopoly which it seemed almost\nimpossible to break down, and it was only after years of bitter and\ndetermined struggle that the school of nature finally routed its\nopponent.\n\nDelaroche doubtlessly found the peasant painter a little rude both in\nhis person and in his ideas about art. He paid but little attention to\nthe young man who had placed himself in his hands, and devoted all his\ntime to students who were more amenable to his influence. A\ntemperament so sensitive as Millet's was bound to notice this\nneglect, and consequently after a time he became so discouraged that\nhe ceased to frequent Delaroche's studio. Another very good reason for\nthis action was the lack of resources to continue his payments. Even\nduring the time he had been with Delaroche he lost no opportunity of\nturning a few honest francs by painting the portraits of any who could\nbe got to sit to him. Delaroche, however, had a more kindly heart than\nMillet imagined. He seems to have found out the real distress of the\nyoung artist, and to have assisted him pecuniarily in many ways, and\nthere is no doubt that he appreciated the talent of the young Norman\nmuch more than he cared to own. Many of his remarks on record would\nserve to show that Delaroche already felt that his pupil was destined\nto be one of the leaders of the movement which was finally to\noverthrow his own style, and doubtlessly felt a great admiration for a\nman who had the courage and strength to swim against rather than with\nthe current.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STRUGGLE FOR RECOGNITION\n\n\nFreed from all encumbrances save poverty, Millet was now to work out\nhis own destiny according to the dictates of his genius. He joined a\nfriend named Marolle, and the two together occupying a very small\napartment endeavoured to eke out an existence. It was only too soon\napparent that young as he was, and the taste of the public being not\nyet ready for development upon the lines his genius directed him, that\nhis livelihood could not be secured by endeavouring to sell such\nsubjects as appealed to him. In these straits he turned to\nportrait-painting, just as many great painters before and since him\nhave done. That the struggle was very keen can well be imagined by the\nfact that he was unable to obtain more than five to ten francs apiece;\nand, as commissions were very scarce, he was hard put to gain the\nmeans of subsistence. This state of affairs lasted until 1840, in\nwhich year he endeavoured to obtain admission to the Salon with two\nportraits, one of which was that of his friend. This, however, was\nrejected, and the other picture, although accepted, was unnoticed by\neither the critics or the public.\n\nHaving occasion the next year to pay a visit to Cherbourg, he felt\nobliged to report himself to the Municipal Council who had had the\ngenerosity to send him in the first place to Paris. Its worthy members\nexpressed themselves as but little satisfied with the result of their\ninvestment; they claimed that they had had as yet but little to show\nfor their money, and they suggested, partly as a means of\ndemonstrating that they had had some little return, and also, in order\nto see of what stuff their prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was made, that he should paint a\nportrait of the recently deceased mayor. As Millet had not been\npersonally acquainted with that worthy citizen, and as the only guide\nwhich could be supplied him was a portrait made in miniature when he\nwas a young man of some twenty-three or twenty-four years of age, the\ntask was by no means easy. However, the artist set to work with a\nwill, and finally accomplished the picture to his own satisfaction.\n\nUpon it being shown to the Council, one and all declared, as any one\nwith the slightest knowledge of such matters could have told them\nbefore it was commenced, that it bore not the least resemblance to the\ndefunct magistrate. They therefore demurred at the three hundred\nfrancs they had agreed to pay him for the portrait, and offered him\none-third of that amount instead. Millet was deeply offended by the\ninsult, and informed the Council that he made them a present of the\npicture.\n\nIt was during this short visit to his native country that he met his\nfirst wife, a Mlle. Ono, whose portrait he had painted. From the first\nshe was very delicate, and he lost her after much suffering, three\nyears later. His second wife was Mlle. Catherine Lemaire, who was\ndestined to be the companion of his struggles until the end of his\nlife.\n\nMeanwhile Millet was occupied with subjects which he thought would\nappeal to the general public. A number of classical pictures date from\nthis epoch. It was an endeavour on his part to fall in as far as\npossible with the current taste, and so supply means of subsistence\nfor his family. At the same time he did not neglect his favourite\nsubjects, and many are the wonderful studies of peasant life which\ndate from these years. His reputation had so far advanced that he was\noffered the position of teacher of drawing in the college at\nCherbourg. It must have been only after prolonged deliberation that he\nrefused the proffered post. Here a certain annual stipend was assured\nhim, and if it was not large in itself it would at any rate suffice to\nkeep the wolf from the door. He preferred, however, to return to Paris\nand work out his own destiny as best he might.\n\nMillet, who lived at this time in the Rue Rochechouart, began to\nsurround himself with that little group of friends who remained\nfaithful to him until the end of his career. Amongst the earliest were\nCharles Jacque and Diaz: the latter had several clients amongst the\nsmall dealers, whom he induced to visit Millet's studio and make now\nand again a small purchase.\n\nMillet now became a fairly regular contributor to the Salon, but\ngenerally sent some classical or religious picture as well as one of\nhis peasant subjects. For example, in 1848 he sent the marvellous\nstudy of \"The Winnower,\" which we all know so well, accompanied by a\ncanvas, \"The Captivity of the Jews at Babylon.\" The latter, however,\nwas so badly received that he utilised the canvas upon its return for\na large picture of a \"Shepherdess tending her Sheep.\"\n\nIn spite of the headway that he was making, the struggle for existence\nseemed keener than ever, and but for the kindness of friends he and\nhis family would frequently have actually wanted for food. A timely\nadvance of one hundred francs obtained for him from the Minister of\nFine Arts, together with a commission from the State, for which he was\npaid the sum of eighteen hundred francs, were for some time the only\nrelief he obtained from his embarrassments. That he was not particular\nas to how he earned his daily bread is apparent from the fact that he\ndid not despise an order for a shop sign for a midwife, for which he\nwas paid the miserable amount of thirty francs.\n\nThe year 1848 was not an encouraging one for a painter who was\nstanding on the threshold of his career. The whole of Europe was\nseething with revolution. A repetition of the fearful year of 1792 was\neverywhere expected. The struggle betwixt reaction and property on the\none hand, and lawlessness and revolution on the other, was being waged\nwith grim determination. The issue was for long in the balance. One\nnever knew from one day to another what was going to happen. In such a\ndeplorable state of affairs men's minds were running on politics and\nwars rather than upon art. Millet amongst the rest was called upon to\nshoulder the musket, and it can be easily imagined with what\nreluctance he did so.\n\nParis, the great centre of art, had yet not afforded him much\nencouragement. Life was dear in the big city, and surrounded on all\nsides by bricks and mortar he was not free to go out into the fields\nand study the objects which were uppermost in his mind. He resolved to\nescape from it, and once having put the plan into execution he never\nreturned.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET IN HIS MATURITY\n\n\nThe Barbizon of 1850 was a very different place from the Barbizon of\nto-day. The world fame of the men who passed a quiet and strenuous\nexistence in the little village has transformed it into a tourist\nresort, with restaurants and caf\u00e9s, the stopping-places for\nwaggonettes which in summer bring their daily load of sightseers,\neager to see the homes of the painters whose names are now household\nwords.\n\nIt would have been well-nigh impossible for the little band to have\nchosen a more suitable spot for their labours. Rousseau and Millet,\nmuch as they were drawn towards each other by the tie of a sympathetic\ndisposition and by their common interest in art, yet were widely\ndissimilar from one another in their outlook upon art and their\nmethods of worship at the common shrine. Rousseau--one can see it from\nevery picture he painted--loved with all the yearning of a passionate\nand restless temperament the inanimate in Nature. Observe with what\nfidelity he draws his trees, with what caressing tenderness his clouds\nand skies are treated; solitude appealed to him above all things, and\nif here and there he was obliged to insert a few figures to complete\nhis composition, one instinctively feels that he would rather have\nsubstituted a group of cattle or a flock of sheep. In the glades of\nthe forest, far from the busy haunts of men, with the glorious\nsunlight penetrating from above, the breeze moaning through the\nbranches, he was happy. A wild and turbulent temperament such as his\nnot infrequently discovers exquisite enjoyment amidst such perfect\ntranquillity.\n\nBarbizon, situated on the fringe of the great forest of Fontainebleau,\ntherefore, permitted Rousseau to come into daily contact with the\nscenes which so appealed to him.\n\nMillet, on the other hand, was absorbed in the peasant. The man who\ntilled the soil and raised the produce humanity requires for its\nsubsistence by the sweat of his brow; the manifold duties of the\nlabourer, his life and sorrows, appealed to him with irresistible\nforce. An unpeopled track of wild and uncultivated land would not call\nforth any emotion in him, no matter how sublime the scenery might be.\n\nThe life of the village, spreading itself into the vast and fertile\nplain behind, held him absorbed; a peasant himself and living amongst\nthe people he so loved, he was in a position to bring before an\nunthinking world the poignant monotony of their useful lives.\n\nUpon their first arrival at Barbizon, the two artists put up at a\nsmall inn, working all day in a tiny place they had rented from some\npeasants and fitted up as a studio. The inconveniences of this\narrangement were soon apparent, and shortly afterwards Millet took a\nsmall house which was destined to be his abode for the remainder of\nhis life; an old barn in the immediate vicinity meanwhile provided him\nwith an excellent studio.\n\nFrom this period onward we must date the greatest productions of the\nmaster, the works which have induced more thought than those of any\nother peasant painter. A peasant among peasants, his life was of the\nmost rigid simplicity. Behind his little abode a large garden\nstretched away almost to the fringe of the forest itself, and here he\nwas accustomed to work every morning, growing a portion of the food\nnecessary to the sustenance of his family. The afternoon he devoted to\npainting, whilst the evening was given over to intercourse with his\nlittle circle of friends. The simplicity and tranquillity of his life\naroused the whole of his powers to action, and surrounded with\neverything he valued in life he was supremely happy.\n\nThe country around Barbizon appealed to him irresistibly. The\ntimber-studded plains, the gently undulating, highly cultivated\nfields, presented a strange contrast to the wild and rugged country\namidst which he had spent his childhood, and no doubt conduced to the\ndevelopment of a more refined and contemplative style than he would\notherwise have acquired. Upon his few visits to his native country he\nappears to have been more impressed than ever with its austerity, and\nthe drawings which these journeys called forth bore ample evidence of\nthis feeling in him.\n\nLack of the necessary funds to carry on even his simple m\u00e9nage was\never the bane of Millet's life. On many occasions Sensier, his\nintimate friend and afterwards his biographer, informs us he dissuaded\nhim from suicide.\n\nThe sums that he owed, small though they were, rendered him in\nconstant fear of the brokers. With creditors so importunate in their\ndemands for satisfaction, and with the constant lack of recognition,\nwhich was his lot, it is astonishing that Millet achieved so much. He\nwas relieved more than once by the kind-hearted and ever faithful\nRousseau, who when his friend was sorest pressed found some delicately\nhidden means to relieve him. It was he who acquired for 4000 francs\nthe wonderful \"Peasant grafting a Tree,\" when the picture failed to\nfind a purchaser; and in order that Millet should not be aware of his\ngenerosity, he made the offer in the name of an imaginary American.\n\nThis sort of goodness he repeated more than once, and it redounds\nstill more to his credit when we remember that Rousseau himself was\nnot infrequently in pecuniary difficulties.\n\nA constant succession of important works made their appearance during\nthe first ten years Millet spent at Barbizon. The first was the\nwell-known \"Sower,\" which has ever been one of the most popular of his\npictures. Then came the far finer \"Peasants going to Work,\" which for\nmany years was in an English Collection. The \"Gleaners,\" perhaps the\nnoblest canvas the master ever painted, dates from 1857, in which year\nit was seen at the Salon; the celebrated \"Angelus\" followed it two\nyears later. The prices which Millet obtained for this series of\nremarkable works was fantastically small. The \"Gleaners\" brought him a\npaltry 2000 francs, whilst he accounted himself lucky to encounter an\namateur who gave him the same sum for the small \"Woman feeding Fowls.\"\n\nThe \"Angelus,\" which was never exhibited, was sold in the year it was\npainted to a Monsieur Feydeau, an architect, for 1800 francs. It then\npassed through several hands before the late Monsieur Secr\u00e9tan\ncompeted up to 160,000 francs before he became possessed of the prize\nat the John Wilson sale.\n\nThe purchase, however, proved a sound investment, for upon the\ndispersal of his collection it was knocked down for 553,000 francs to\na Monsieur Proust, acting on behalf of the French Government. The\nlatter, however, when they gave the commission to buy the picture, had\nno idea that such a high value would be placed upon it, and\nconsequently refused to ratify the sale; a syndicate now came upon the\nscene, who took it to America. The price, however, proved greater than\neven the millionaires of the States were prepared to give, and the\ncanvas again returned to France, where it found a resting-place in the\ncollection of Monsieur Chauchard, who paid the enormous sum of 800,000\nfrancs for its possession.\n\nIn 1859 Millet sent two works to the Salon, a \"Woman grazing her Cow,\"\nand \"Death and the Woodman.\" The latter, one of the most\nphilosophical of Millet's pictures, which to-day is the principal\nattraction of the Jacobsen Museum at Copenhagen, was rejected.\n\nDisappointments of this kind came with such systematic regularity to\nthe painter that he must have become proof against them. He always had\nbitter enemies amongst the critics, who never failed to pour abuse\nupon his method and his subjects. Even a number of his fellow artists\njoined in the chorus of disapproval. But the vehemence with which he\nwas attacked was striking evidence of the impression he was making and\nthe inward sense of his own powers; and the fact that he was working\nout his destiny according to the dictates of his own genius supported\nhim against this outpouring of prejudice and malice. The social side\nof life appealed to him more strongly as the years rolled on, and the\nmurmurings which had been heard in 1859 as to the socialistic\ntendencies of \"Death and the Woodman\" swelled to a roar when the\nstupendous \"Man with the Hoe\" was exhibited fourteen years later. The\nlatter, one of the most virile studies of depraved humanity which the\nworld has ever seen, has always been a favourite with social\nreformers, and has inspired one remarkable poem. Even his most\nimplacable critics were disarmed before this canvas; its power was\nmagnetic; it was an inspiration, soul moving and trenchant.\n\nHis financial difficulties never completely dispersed. At one time, in\norder to insure himself a little tranquillity, he made a contract with\ntwo speculators, whereby they were to become possessors of all the\nwork he produced for three years, in consideration of their assuring\nhim a thousand francs a month. A great number of Millet's finest\nproductions passed thus through their hands, including the \"Return\nfrom the Fields\" and the \"Man with the Hoe.\" The partners were not\nlong in quarrelling, and after a lawsuit had been fought, Millet was\nleft in the hands of a man who frequently would not or could not pay\nhim in ready money, and whose bills he was frequently forced to\ndiscount at considerable loss.\n\nOne little gleam of sunshine rendered his later days happy. This was a\ncommission from a Colmar banker, Monsieur Thomas by name, who required\nfour allegorical compositions representing the Seasons, to decorate\nhis rooms. The artist was overjoyed by this piece of good fortune,\nand immediately commenced a most conscientious study of such mural\ndecoration as was within reach, in order that he might do full justice\nto his patron. He paid frequent visits to Fontainebleau and the\nLouvre, and even desired a friend to inquire if he could not obtain\nreproductions of the frescoes at Herculaneum and Pompeii. In spite of\nall this elaborate preparation, the subjects were not such as appealed\nto his genius, and in spite of them being well and soundly painted, we\nare told that they presented no features which called for special\ncomment.\n\nHe found, however, a much more genial occupation in accomplishing a\nseries of drawings ordered by a Monsieur Gavet, who paid the artist\n1000, 700, and 450 francs each, according to their size. He made\naltogether ninety-five drawings in this way, and it is said that this\ngentleman had in his possession the finest work in black and white and\nwater-colour the artist ever executed.\n\nTowards the latter end of his life the death of dear relatives and\nfriends cast a sorrowful gloom over him. Amongst the latter Rousseau,\nwho expired in his presence on the 22nd of December 1867, was\nperhaps the loss which seemed to him hardest to bear. A staunch and\ntrusty friend, who was to be relied upon when his prospects seemed the\nmost hopeless, he had been one of the very few who had appreciated\nMillet's talents at their full worth, and who, moreover, scanty as his\nown means were, was ever ready to stretch out his hand to assist his\nstruggling friend.\n\nShortly afterwards Millet paid a visit to his patron, Herr Hartmann,\nat M\u00fcnster, and from here he went for a short time into Switzerland.\n\nUpon his return he devoted himself with great earnestness to work, and\nachieved a certain success at the Salons with his exhibits. The\noutbreak of the war with Germany caused him to migrate with his family\nto Cherbourg, where he thought he might continue to work, removed as\nfar as possible from the scenes of carnage and struggle which were\ngoing on farther east. Transported once more amongst the scenes of his\nchildhood, he felt an increased impetus to production, and when he\nreturned to Barbizon late in 1871, he brought with him a number of\ncanvases of the highest quality; conspicuous amongst them was the\nwonderful \"Gr\u00e9ville Church,\" now in the Louvre.\n\nThe anxieties of his troublous life were, however, beginning to show\ntheir effect upon his constitution; a persistent cough developed, and\nalthough an amelioration would occasionally occur, it was always\nsucceeded by a worse condition than before. His health suffered a\ngeneral decline, and he finally breathed his last on the 20th of\nJanuary 1875. He was buried in the little cemetery of Chailly, beside\nhis friend Rousseau, amidst the scenery they both loved so well.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE MAN AND HIS ART\n\n\nMillet is an instance of an artist working out his own destiny,\nimpelled by irresistible genius, in the teeth of seemingly\ninsurmountable obstacles. He started life with enormous disadvantages;\nwithout friends in influential circles to spread his fame or plead his\ncause; without money to enable him to outlive and triumph over the\nignorant fanaticism of critics and artists, so soaked in the\nconventionalised art of their time that they had not perception enough\nto appreciate the full meaning of that naturalistic movement, which\nwas finally to sweep away the quasi-classic art they boasted of with\nsuch bombastic effusion. The path was hard and thorny, and his triumph\nwas not finally consummated until after his death. He himself found\nhis only satisfaction in the fact that he had lived his life according\nto the dictates of his genius, and had achieved the maximum of which\nhe was capable.\n\nMillet and our own Cotman were somewhat kindred spirits; there is much\nmore affinity between the work of the two men than is apparent to any\none who has not closely studied them. The marvellous \"Breaking the\nClod,\" now happily permanently housed at the British Museum, betrays\nthe same tremendous conception and broad outlook which characterises\nmany a drawing of Millet's. Both highly strung to a painful extent,\nthey were each conscious of their inability to curb the power which\nprescribed a certain course for them, and in spite of pecuniary\ndifficulties and unpopularity, an inevitable result of their intense\noriginality, they pursued a steady course to the end of their lives.\n\nThe socialistic doctrines which have been read into the work of Millet\nare rather the outcome of the world's uneasy conscience being brought\nface to face with a crushing indictment of existing conditions, than\nof any design on the artist's part to further the cause of a political\npropaganda by means of his art. This somewhat extravagant reading into\nhis art has certainly been carried to excess. Particularly has such\nbeen the case in America, where a large number of his finest works are\nat present to be found, curiously enough in the hands of enormously\nwealthy people, who are frequently perhaps the least able to\nunderstand the real meaning of his message.\n\nComing from a peasant stock, his sympathies were always with the\npeasant; it was the only class he understood or cared for. He lived as\none of them, and shared to a large extent in their labour. He has been\ndesignated, not inappropriately, the philosopher in sabots. Rightly or\nwrongly he has come to be looked upon as one of the high priests of\ncommunistic doctrines. Few pictures have been so anathematised as the\n\"Man with the Hoe,\" and perhaps none have done more to inculcate\nsympathy with the degradation of the lower orders of the human race.\n\nThe revolting brutality and vacancy of that face haunts the\nimagination. Is it possible that fellow-creatures so utterly debased\nby toil and neglect exist? Millet dispels any doubt upon the question\nby bequeathing to humanity this trenchant portrait. By no means\nlimited to Barbizon or France, these poor creatures exist in every\ncountry, and curiously enough are considered an essential element in\neach country's development.\n\nThis poignantly human note is observable in almost every work Millet\nwrought; his passionate sympathy with his fellow-man is the keynote of\nhis art. The wood-cutter in his arduous toil, the shepherd in his\nsolitariness, the labourer turning the soil with unvarying and\nlaborious monotony, the mother caring for her children--all carry the\nsame message for him of that strange and incomprehensible mingling of\njoy and sadness we call life. Like many great minds before and since\nhis time, our artist found the greatest joy in life in a placid and\nnever changing melancholy. But the peasants he chose knew nothing of\nthe sadness he saw in them. Completely inured to their toil, and\nsubdued by it, with no refining or uplifting influence to stimulate\nthem, they knew nothing, aspired to nothing beyond what they were; it\nwas left to Millet to supply the \"might have been.\" He saw the inky\nblackness of the mind of the \"Man with the Hoe,\" the pathetic\ninequality between the mounted farmer directing the safe storage of\nhis crop, and the stooping figures of the \"Gleaners\" eager to scrape\nup the miserable crumbs which had fallen from the rich man's table. He\ntraced the lives of these simple folk until we arrive at the grim and\ngaunt figure of Death, who, as he grasps the woodman by the shoulder,\nreminds him that his course is finished and that he, in common with\nall his fellow-men, must enter the great unknown land from which there\nis no return. It is a sad and melancholy art, vibrating with purity\nand truth, the outpouring of a great soul yearning to express itself\nto the utmost of its power. The mind and character of the man can be\nread in every line and in every touch of the brush. His drawings and\netchings are even more searching in their virility than his pictures.\n\nThere is a spontaneousness about them we search for in vain in his\nwork in oil and pastel. In black and white his intensely emotional\nmind found a swift method of expression; in the laboriousness of oil\npainting he was fettered with the complications of the medium. It can\nbe fairly said that only in one or two paintings--a notable example\ncan be cited in the wondrous \"Sawyers\" at South Kensington--does he\nrise to the height of a great painter. Millet was a poet, a\nphilosopher, a great thinker, and the means he chose for expressing\nhimself were those which were best fitted to his purpose. His\npredilections in art were concentrated upon the greatest, and\nconsequently the men who appealed to him were the thinkers of the\nages. Mantegna and Correggio, Michel Angelo and the mighty Greeks,\nthese were the masters who left their impress upon his mind and art.\n\nThe influence of so sincere and profound an artist has necessarily\nbeen profound. He has moulded men who have achieved world-wide fame;\nSegantini, for example, would never have risen to the heights he did\nhad the example of Millet not been ever before him. There have been\nmany who, without possessing his genius, have endeavoured to follow\nin his footsteps, but successfully as his imitators have sometimes\ncaught his style, their productions can never live alongside his,\nbecause they lack the real ring of sincerity.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n        a. One bed, or folding cot,\n        b. One oil stove,\n        c. One lamp,\n        d. Enough supplies of all kinds sufficient for six months,\n        e. Pots, pans, kettles, etc.\nIt is needless to say that positions in Manila and Iloilo were now at\na premium.\n\nWas it possible that teachers were to be sent to places where even the\nnecessaries of life could not be obtained! Was it possible that many\nwould be sent to places so remote that for six months no fresh\nsupplies could be gotten! A mass meeting was held at once, and a\ncommittee was appointed to send a cablegram to the Associated Press\npetitioning aid from the American people at large. Realizing what\nconsternation would be created throughout the United States by such a\nmessage, two of the teachers leaped into a carriage at the close of\nthe meeting and a few moments later were closeted with the chief\nexecutive of the department. As a result the committee was persuaded\nnot to send the cablegram to the Associated Press until by courtesy it\nhad been sent to the President. Of course, this diplomatic move tided\naffairs over and the teachers who had flatly refused to budge from\nManila now agreed to go on to their stations, being assured that\nwhatever action was best would be taken.\n\nThe day had come when we must separate. We were to enter an untried\nand an unknown field. It was fitting that we have a final joyous\nmeeting, so the best orchestra in the archipelago was engaged and we\n\"chased the hours with flying feet\" until dawn so that whatever might\ncome to us in that unknown future upon which we were entering each\nwould hold in pleasant memory our last evening together.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER III. - A DRAMA IN ACTUAL LIFE.\n\n\nAlmost every one heeded the warning to go to his station forearmed\nwith at least necessaries of life, but, as it had never fallen to the\nlot of the writer to cook, he refused to learn at that late day, so he\ntook no pot, no pan, no kettle, putting his future into the hands of\nan uncertain fate and relying upon the unknown hospitality of the\nFilipino.\n\nBacalod, the capital of the province of Occidental Negros, was our\ndestination. The second morning after leaving Manila, we awoke with\nthe \"Kilpatrick\" lying at anchor in a shallow bay. We were several\nmiles from the shore and nothing in sight indicated that we had\nreached a place of any importance. Late the night before we had been\nawakened by the loud, sharp ringing of the ship's bells, accompanied\nby the reversal of the engines and a general disturbance awaking the\ncrew. So our first impressions on coming on deck were that we had run\naground. But the captain assured us that everything was ship-shape and\nthat this was the nearest point of approach to Capiz, a town of\nconsiderable importance on the island of Panay, where a body of troops\nwas to embark for home. Not even the grass hut of a native was in\nsight. Search as we would, not a sign was seen of a stream flowing\ninto the sea, indicating the probable presence of a town. There was\nnot a sign of life of any kind save one lone column of thin, blue\nsmoke that arose from the side of a mountain miles away. One would\nhave thought that we were explorers of three hundred years ago lying\noff the shore of some unknown land.\n\nAfter breakfast the steam launch, together with all the boats, was\nlowered, and several of us who had determined to miss no opportunity\nto gather information about the islands took our places in the launch\nby the side of the ship's mate, and steamed away across the water with\na long line of boats strung out in the rear. We headed away toward a\ngroup of cocoanut trees, and about an hour later stepped ashore on a\npile of decayed coral rocks that extended some twenty or thirty feet\nout into the water, thus forming the only landing place of a town of\nseveral thousands of people and of considerable commercial importance.\n\nA few moments after we had landed, an army wagon drawn by a\nmagnificent pair of mules came up out of a tropical jungle along a\nnarrow road. We clambered into the wagon and were soon lost in the\ndepths of foliage from which we had just seen the vehicle emerge.\n\nLong waving bamboos with their plumy leafage hung over the road from\neach side, meeting and overlapping in the center until they formed an\narchway so dense that the tropical sun now high in the heavens\npenetrated it only at intervals. At times the wagon sank up to the\nhubs in the soft earth, and the muscles of the mules stood out like\nwhip-cords under the skin as they drew us forward.\n\nAt a sharp turn in the road we came upon the first division of troops\nthat was to embark for home. The look of joy upon their sun-browned\nfaces was inexpressible. Their work was done, and with elastic step\nand smiling faces they saluted us as they passed by. The reign of\nforce was at an end; it was going out with them; the reign of peace\nhad begun; it was coming in with us.\n\nIn the afternoon when we returned from the town the last of the troops\nhad arrived and, as we drove up, the bugle was sounding the call to\nsupper. We noticed native women mingling with the troops and, indeed,\na native woman was in constant attention waiting upon one of the\nsoldiers with whom we ate. Her clothes were clean, her hair was nicely\ncombed, and her general appearance was neat. She seemed to anticipate\nthe slightest wish of the soldier with whom she was. She brought him\nwater to drink, cleaned his plate after the meal and saw that his\nknife, fork, and spoon were put into his haversack.\n\nWe had now finished supper and the launch had returned for the last\nload of troops. The lieutenant in command of the company gave the\norder to \"fall in\"; the men shouldered their rifles and fell into\nline. \"Forward, march!\" called the lieutenant, and the column swept\nforward towards the boats. The women had until now restrained\nthemselves, but, as their husbands marched away never to return, their\nfeelings could no longer be restrained. One young woman of about\neighteen, who was leaning against a rock by the roadside sobbing, when\nher husband passed, leaped up in frenzy of passionate love and caught\nthe rifle from his shoulder. Her first impulse seemed to be to throw\nthe gun away, but suddenly realizing the futility of such an act she\nburst into tears, shouldered the rifle herself and marched on by his\nside. Another woman of more mature age threw her arms around the legs\nof a tall stalwart man, and drew him bodily from the line.\n\nBut the troops marched on and entered the boats. One woman who had\nbeen unnoticed before came down into the shallow water and caught hold\nof our last boat as if to prevent its leaving, while others stood\nmingling their sobs with the sounds of the wavelets as they broke on\nthe sands. As we passed away, an expectant mother, standing in bold\noutline against the twilight sky, threw up her hands in an agony of\ndespair and then sank upon the stones. The curtain had fallen upon a\ndrama in actual life deeper in pathos than any other we had ever seen\nor ever expected to see. Depth of passion, depth of love! Who can\nfathom the human heart?\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. - WHAT THE TEACHERS DID.\n\n\nThere is a remarkable sameness about the towns in the Philippines.\n\nThey all have a large open square about the middle of the town, around\nthree sides of which are Chinese stores, unless one side lies open to\nthe sea, and on the fourth is the great stone ecclesia. The streets\nrun at right angles to one another and divide up the town into\ncreditable squares.\n\nEverybody in the Philippines lives up-stairs, for the ground is so\nsoaked with water during the rainy season that it is a menace to\nhealth to live upon the ground floor. So even the poorest nippa hut\nis built upon stakes four or five feet above the ground.\n\nBacalod is a typical Philippine town. As we landed, a broad open\nsquare was spread out before us. Two sides of the square were lined\nwith two-story houses in which were Chinese stores below and Filipino\nhomes above. On the third side stood the great stone church in whose\nmassive tower the clock was striking the hour of four, while the\nfourth lay open to the sea that had borne us thither.\n\nWe landed, but it was in a method new to us and one not usually\nemployed by the traveling public.\n\nWhen our sail boat ran aground on the sandy bottom a hundred yards or\nmore from the shore, a crowd of Filipino men who were on the beach\nslowly rolled up their pantaloons and waded out to the rescue,--for\nthe money that was in it. The boat's crew elevated their trousers'\nlegs also and slided down into the water. Each of us then straddled\nthe neck of a Filipino standing in the water and was held by ankles to\nbe steadied while our biped mounts proceeded to the shore.\n\nWe were now on the ground and face to face with the situation. To give\nthe reader an idea of the actual conditions met by the first teachers\nwho went to the Islands, the following is copied from the instructions\ngiven us in Manila:\n    1. There shall be two sessions daily of all schools, and the\n    last hour of the morning session shall be devoted solely to\n    instructing the Filipino teachers.\n\n    2. In cases where teachers are sent to a town in which there\n    is no school-house, they are expected to secure the aid of the\n    people and have one built.\n\n    3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is\n    stopped.\n\n    4. All supplies must be kept under lock and key. In towns\n    where there is no case or box to lock the supplies in, and it\n    is also impossible to get the town council to furnish a case,\n    a requisition may be sent to Manila, and, if an appropriation\n    can be secured, one will be made and sent out.\n\nThus it can be easily seen that we were indeed pioneers. In many\nplaces no school-house was to be found, and in some cases it was even\ndifficult to get the town council to provide a case in which to keep\nthe supplies.\n\nThe work of the teachers was, in short; to \"make the English language\nthe basis of instruction in the public schools.\" On our arrival at\nBacalod two schools were found in progress, for some soldiers had been\ndetailed for the work here previous to our coming. One of these was\nfor boys and the other, for girls. Thus the work here had been in a\nmeasure simplified, but complications that had arisen at Talisay, one\nof the largest and richest towns on the island, demanded a change of\nteachers and the writer was assigned to the place as superintendent.\n\nHere an attempt had been made to start a school but it had failed\nignominiously and a system of education was to be put into operation\nfrom the very start.\n\nThe Filipinos are not strong advocates of co-education, so separate\nschools were to be started for the boys and the girls. The one for the\nboys was gotten well in hand before the one for the girls was\nattempted at all.\n\nA few days after reaching the town and securing a home the\npresidente of the town had it publicly announced that the following\nMonday morning at eight o'clock a public school for boys would be\nopened in a building that had been rented for the purpose by the\nmunicipal council. About the middle of the afternoon of the same day a\nman beat a little drum throughout all the streets of the town to call\nthe people out and the town clerk announced both in Spanish and in the\nnative language that this public school would begin at the time and\nplace mentioned above; that instruction would be free to all who came;\nthat the government would furnish all supplies; and that instruction\nwould be given in the English language. A native principal and\nassistants were employed and everything was ready to begin.\n\nThe official report of the result is as follows:\n    Boys' public school of Talisay, Negros, P. I., began November\n    4, 1901. Forty-three boys present at eight o'clock. Forty-one\n    of them knew \"good morning\" and \"good afternoon\" but do not\n    know the distinction between them. Two of them speak simple\n    Spanish. At eight forty-five, eight more, who had been\n    attending an early morning private school, came in together.\n\n    The books they brought were so varied and so different from\n    one another that it seemed impossible to bring any reasonable\n    degree of order out of such a chaos, and so, after struggling\n    vainly for about a week with the problem, the superintendent\n    by one fell stroke removed everything in use and put in a\n    uniform system, and from that day on the English language has\n    been the basis of instruction in the public schools of\n    Talisay. The work was of necessity very slow at first, but by\n    the end of a year two schools were going nicely and a number\n    of the brightest boys and girls had made really excellent\n    progress.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER V. - A \"BAILE.\"\n\n\nNot long after the arrival of our party at Bacalod we received an\ninvitation to a \"baile\" given in our honor by the inhabitants of\nSilay, a town some ten or twelve miles up the northern coast and one\nnoted for its social life. The invitation was accepted with pleasure,\nand about the middle of the afternoon on the day appointed we were\nclad in the immaculate white of the tropics and steaming away up the\ncoast on board a launch sent for our conveyance. Twilight was still\nlingering on the path of day when we anchored just off shore at the\ntown. A row-boat containing the officials of the city came out to meet\nus and, in due season, we were ushered into a spacious drawing-room\nfilled almost to overflowing with the \u00e9lite of the town. The \u00e9lite of\ntowns in the Philippines speak Spanish, and, as only one or two of our\nparty could at that time boast of more than a formal acquaintance with\nthe Castilian tongue, the exchange of ideas that evening between us\nand the Filipinos was of necessity not very rapid.\n\nThe necessity of easy communication between us was rendered somewhat\nless indispensable by the announcement of supper as soon as we were\nrested from our trip. When we had taken our places at the table a\nyoung Filipino about twenty-five years of age arose and gave a lengthy\ntoast to the recent union of the Philippines with the United States.\n\nBut as we Americans were unable to scale the dizzy heights of his\nclimaxes or sink to the depths of his pathos, we forewent the\npleasures of his oratory and turned our attention to the savory odor\nof lamb, chicken, and roast pig that came slyly stealing up our\nnostrils to send us nerve dispatches about the gastronomic delights of\nour not far distant future.\n\nAt last the toast was ended and the world-wide soup ushered in a long\ntrain of things good to eat, served in a style better fitted to the\ndelights of the appetite than to the formalities of dinners, for, as\nsoon as the pleasant task of one dish was completed by any one, the\nnext was served him at once regardless of the progress made by the\nothers at the table.\n\nThe last course was dulce. The new-comers to the Philippines will\nnot be long in making the acquaintance of this dish, and at all\nmeetings, both public and private, where eatables are served, it\nperforms an important part. It is anything sweet, and it may vary all\nthe way from an india-rubber-like black mixture of cocoanut milk and\ndirty sugar to a really toothsome and respectable confection. No\nmatter of what materials a dish is composed, just so long as it is\nsweet, it is dulce.\n\nAfter paying our respects to this last course, we arose from the table\nand entered a great rectangular room from the center of whose ceiling\nhung a large glass chandelier, a mass of shimmering crystals. In the\nchairs around the room were the wealth, the youth, and the beauty of\nthe town.\n\nThe first and also the last number of every Filipino dance of any\nformality is the \"rigodon.\" The dancers are arranged in a square, or\nquadrangle according to the number participating, and are then led\nthrough a tangled maze of figures that so utterly bewilders the novice\nthat he sinks into his chair at the end of the dance wondering how it\nall came to pass.\n\nWe Americans breathed a sigh of relief when the \"rigodon\" ended, and\nmustered fresh courage for social conquests in the waltz that was now\nbreathing forth from the trembling strings. My companion in the first\ndance had been the young lady by whose side I had sat at dinner. But\nit now became necessary to search for another, so I prudently waited\nto see how partners were chosen, and made no mistake when a few\nmoments later I faced one of the most luscious looking se\u00f1oritas on\nthe opposite side of the room and offered her my arm. My eyes must\nhave told the story that my lips could not utter in Spanish, for she\nsmiled upon me sweetly, arose, and put her hand upon my shoulder. My\narm encircled her waist and I began to waltz. Unfortunately my\ncompanion did not follow, but began to hop up and down in a manner\nmost distressing. Supposing the attack to be only temporary, I paused\nand, much to my relief, she soon showed signs of recovery; and in the\ncourse of time she came to a standstill looking up into my face in an\ninquiring sort of way, apparently wondering why St. Vitus had not paid\nhis respects to me also. A second attempt to follow the music met with\nresults similar to the first, and during the third attempt, which\nseemed to be trembling on the verge of a failure, St. Vitus let go my\ncompanion and seized me with such vigor that she, who was small even\nfor a Filipino, was gathered up bodily and taken around the room at\nsuch a pace that her toes touched the floor only at far distant\nintervals.\n\nAt this point my devotion to the shrine of Terpsichore ceased from\nforce of circumstances and I seated myself in one of the most\ncomfortable chairs in sight that I might carry out a previously formed\nplan to study the Filipino somewhat critically as he appears in\nsociety.\n\nThe first thing that impressed me as the dancers passed up and down\nthe room was the flash of diamonds. Nearly every woman in the room had\non a brooch that flashed the colors of the rainbow at every turn.\n\nAlmost all of them wore one or more rings that showed up brilliantly\nunder the chandelier. Many of the men too, especially the young men,\nwore gems that appeared to be exquisite. A closer inspection showed\nthat some of the gems had flaws and others were of a poor color, but\nno one would have denied that, taken as a whole, it was a really\nbeautiful display.\n\nThe dress of the ladies was richly colored. Many of their skirts were\nof silk covered with hand embroidered flowers, and their filmy pina\nwaists and broad collar pieces were rich with needle-work. They all\nwore a kind of heelless velvet slipper, very common as a dress shoe in\nthe Philippines, or high-heeled patent leather shoes with neatly\nfitting black stockings.\n\nThe men were dressed in white coats and white pantaloons or black\ncoats and white pantaloons. White shirts and collars, together with\nall sorts and styles of cravats and low-cut patent leather shoes with\nhighly colored socks completed their dress.\n\nIt was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money;\nthat they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a\ntable loaded with good things was a fact to which all of us were\nenthusiastic witnesses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VI. - A SKETCH OF LIFE IN THE PHILIPPINES.\n\n\nHouse-keeping in the Philippines presents some interesting phases. Our\nclub of American officials decided to run a mess, so we employed a\ncook and a house boy, then each of us provided himself with a personal\nservant, making a total of six servants for four men--it takes about\nthis proportion of servants to live in any sort of comfort in the\nPhilippines--and launched ourselves boldly upon the sea of domestic\neconomy. But there were shoals ahead of us, for the question of\nregulating servants is one of no small importance in the Philippines,\nand one of its most disadvantageous features is the long chain of\ndependents that usually attends it.\n\nWe gave the cooks so much a day with which to buy supplies in the\nlocal market, for our own table, making him render a daily list of\nexpenditures, and a fixed amount besides to purchase rice and fish for\nhimself and the other servants. Of course, if they wished to vary\ntheir diet and get chicken and fresh pork, which could be had at far\ndistant intervals, it was wholly a matter of their option, but the\nallowance was made on the basis of so much rice and fish a day for\neach. This allowance was about fifteen cents a day in Spanish coin per\nservant.\n\nThus far all was well. We had agreed to give the cook eight dollars a\nmonth in Spanish money, thinking that good wages would procure good\nservice, but the visions of affluence that floated before him on such\nfloods of wealth were so alluring that they drew him from the kitchen\nto the cooler veranda. In less than a week he had employed an\nassistant at four dollars a month; in less than another week that\nassistant had employed him an assistant at two dollars a month; in\nless than another week that assistant to the assistant had employed\nhim an assistant at the princely salary of fifty cents a month; and\nfrom fear that the chain of dependents would end only by our having\nthe whole Filipino race attached to our culinary force, we broke up\nhouse-keeping and went boarding again, choosing that as the less of\nthe two evils.\n\nOur house furnishings were almost wholly Philippine. The table ware\nand the food on the table came from the ends of the earth. The knives\nand forks were made in Germany, the plates were manufactured in\nEngland, the glass ware and table cloth, in the United States. The\noatmeal and flour came from the United States also. The butter came\nfrom Australia, the rice from China, the salt from Russia, and the\nother eatables from sources about as various as their separate names.\n\nSwitzerland furnished the condensed milk and Illinois the canned\ncream. Nearly all of the canned fruit bore labels from Spain.\n\nThus it can easily be seen that life in the Philippines, if lived\naccording to American ideals, is dependent upon a highly developed and\nhighly complex commerce. However, the difficulties of transportation\nand the restriction of large stocks of merchandise to Manila and some\nhalf a dozen other towns, make so great a difference between country\nlife and city life that a short comparison of the two will not be out\nof place, and life in Manila may well be taken as being fairly typical\nof the latter.\n\nLife in Manila is pleasant, but expensive. It is pleasant from the\nfact that it is not only the capital but also metropolis of the\narchipelago. Thus the combination of wealth and high official position\nhas given to Manila a society of the highest and most refined type.\n\nThe process of beautifying and improving the city which is constantly\ngoing on bids fair to give us at no distant day a city of which we may\nwell be proud.\n\nBut let him who intends living well in Manila on a small income bid\nfarewell at once to so idylic a dream, for it costs much to live well\nthere. In the city of Manila one can get almost anything he wishes,\nbut it must be paid for at the price it commands. Especially in the\ncase of eatables, this price is by no means small, because to the\nfirst cost of articles must in most cases be added the expense of\ndistant shipment from American, European, or Australian ports, and not\ninfrequently the cost of long refrigeration must also be taken into\nconsideration. But, expensive though it is, it is very pleasant to\nlive there and those who have once enjoyed it often wish again to\nquaff the cup of its delights.\n\nIn strong contrast to this pleasant life is the life of the quiet\nlittle hamlet away in the distant islands. Indeed, the Filipino from\nthe distant town, who by some good fortune has been to Manila, or, by\na coup de main, has studied in one of the Manila colleges, is looked\nup to in a true hero-worshiping attitude by all who either know him or\nhear of his fame. Life in such a place is one long state of harmless\ninactivity. Not a wave of trouble from the great outer world ever\ndisturbs its peaceful repose. One lounges forever in an air of\nindolent ease and extreme aversion to anything approaching what might\nbe called a respectable effort.\n\nOne arises in the morning about the time the sun's first rays silver\nthe top leaves of the cocoanut trees and then stirs around until nine\nor ten o'clock, when it is found expedient to avoid a further exposure\nto the sun. From then until about five o'clock in the afternoon it is\nbest to take things as they come, even though one of those things be a\nFilipino dinner. But then you may have your vehiclo attached to a\nyoung bull with a ring in his nose and go for a drive. If it is the\ndry season you will probably enjoy the drive unless you object to the\nfrequent clouds of dust swept along by the evening wind. If it is in\nthe rainy season your pleasure will depend to a considerable extent\nupon how wet you get; but, whether the season be wet or dry, your\npleasure will be regulated largely by the state of harmony existing\nbetween the driver and the bull.\n\nIn these quiet secluded nooks successive generations of Filipinos are\nborn, reared, grow old and die in an even chain of events broken only\nby the occasional erection of a new grass house on the identical spot\nwhere its predecessors have stood for ages. The son lives in the house\nof his father, cultivates the same few square feet of soil planted in\nedible roots, climbs the same cocoanut trees, follows the same winding\npath down to the stream, pounds rice in the same mortar and with the\nsame stick that his ancestors have used from time unremembered, and,\nin case of illness, curls up on a grass mat in a corner of the room\nuntil he dies or by some good fortune recovers. Beyond this narrow\nhorizon he never looks. So narrow and contracted is the life that the\nlanguages of two towns a few miles apart are so different that one\nwould scarcely recognize them as belonging to the same race of people.\n\nSuch are the two extremes of life in our new far Eastern provinces:\nthe one is active, progressive, and cosmopolitan; the other, inactive,\ndecadent, and narrow; but, whether one enjoys the first or endures the\nsecond, there comes to him after leaving a longing to lounge again in\ntropic airs and listen to the lullaby of the winds among the palms.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VII. - THE FILIPINO AT HOME.\n\n\nAs one enters a Filipino sitting-room for the first time, there is one\nfeature in the arrangement of the furniture that impresses itself upon\nhim at once, and it may be stated without fear of serious\ncontradiction that this same peculiar feature in its arrangement will\ncontinue to face him, as he enters different homes, about as certainly\nas he crosses the threshold.\n\nThe arrangement referred to is that of one large mirror, one settee,\nand some ten or a dozen chairs that appear to have had a certain\norderly affection for one another. The mirror is hung upon one of the\nlarge interior parts of the house about four feet above the floor. The\nwooden houses in the Philippines are built by setting large posts\nupright into the ground, extending into the air from twenty to thirty\nfeet. Cross timbers are fastened to these upright posts about eight or\nten feet above the ground and then not sawed off even with the posts,\nbut allowed to extend beyond them each way. The framework of the house\nis built upon these extending cross timbers, a style of building by\nwhich these large upright posts are left standing out on the inside of\nthe room from one to three feet from the walls. It is on that one of\nthese posts most nearly opposite the door that the mirror always finds\nits place. Immediately beneath the mirror is the settee; and the\nchairs are arranged in two parallel lines facing one another and at\nright angles with the ends of the settee. However odd this arrangement\nmay appear to one when he first enters a Filipino drawing-room, there\nare two things to be said in its favor. In the first place, it places\nyou face to face with the person with whom you are conversing so that\nyou can watch him,--a matter of no small moment in the Philippines. In\nthe next place, it enables you to give one of the young ladies a\nsheep's-eye in the mirror while the others present are left where\nMoses was in our much abused conundrum.\n\nThe size of the residence and the quality of its furnishings depends\nupon the wealth of the owner. But there is so vast a difference\nbetween the mode of life of the highest class and the tao, or lowest\nclass, that it is well to speak of them separately, and the great\nmiddle class of Filipinos can easily be imagined to occupy the\nintervening ground.\n\nThe rich Filipino's house is usually of wood built upon a wall of\nstone or brick from ten to fifteen feet high. The floors are kept\nhighly polished in his hallway, dressing-room, and bed-rooms. There\nare, of course, no fire-places in any of the rooms, but on some\noccasions something is needed to dry the rain-soaked atmosphere, for\neven in the dry season it has been seen to rain for five successive\ndays and nights without the cessation of a moment.\n\nA long chain of dependents is attached to the household of the rich\nFilipino. The master has his special body servant to be present at all\ntimes to do his master's bidding, in short, to be the visible\nmechanism of his master's volition. So, too, the lady of the house has\nher servant woman to do the slightest bidding of her ladyship. Then\nthere is the cook who is almost invariably a man, a house boy or two,\nand the coachman. These functionaries, with their assistants and\nassistants to the assistants, together with a servant or two for the\nexclusive service of the children, complete the economic household.\n\nSuch a family has an abundance of rice and wheat bread, also of\nchicken and fish with occasional fresh beef. They have also a good\ndeal of dulce. They regularly serve wine and frequently serve beer\non their tables.\n\nIn strong contrast with this mode of life is that of the tao. His\ndiet consists almost wholly of rice and small uncleaned fish boiled\ntogether. As a rule knife, fork, plate, and spoon find no place in his\nhousehold. The rice and fish are boiled in a pot and then allowed to\ncool in the same vessel or poured out to cool in a large earthen or\nwooden bowl. Then Mr. Tao together with Mrs. Tao and all the young\nTaos squat on their heels around the mixture and satisfy that\nintangible thing called the appetite. They do not use chop sticks as\nthe Chinese do, but the rice and fish are caught in a hollow formed by\nthe first three fingers of the right hand. The thumb is then placed\nbehind the mass. It is raised up and poised before the mouth, with a\nskill coming from the evolution of ages, when a contraction of the\nmuscles of the thumb throws the mass into the mouth with a skill that\nis marvelous to any but a Filipino. To judge from the most reliable\ninformation, the poorest class do not have an abundance of food,\nalthough it would seem that such a condition of things would be\nwell-nigh impossible. However, in a census of one hundred school\nchildren there were found six boys and four girls who declared that\nthey had never had enough to eat, and the native teacher stated that\nthis was probably true.\n\nThe wide gulf between the tao and the rich man is filled by the\ngreat middle class of Filipinos.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VIII. - VISIT TO A LEPER COLONY.\n\n\nNot far from our town was a leper colony and the first Saturday that\ncould be spared was set aside for a trip to the place. It happened\nthat none of the other Americans were at leisure on this particular\nmorning, but, rather then delay the trip or miss it altogether, the\nwriter, armed with a revolver, started out alone.\n\nThe road had been described so accurately by one who was supposed to\nknow it that it was deemed well-nigh impossible to miss the way. The\nmain highway was followed to the point where the by-path supposed to\nlead to the settlement turned off through some bamboo thickets and a\nlow tropical wood. This path led straight away towards the sea-coast\nwhere the houses of the colony were said to stand in a cocoanut grove\nby the beach.\n\nUpon arriving at the settlement, a very inhospitable reception was\nreceived from a mangy cur that growled and showed a very uninviting\nset of sharp, white teeth behind his snarling lips. The growling of\nthe dog had attracted the attention of an old man who, with age-bent\nback, was pounding rice in a mortar about fifty yards away. He turned\nslowly around and, upon seeing an intruder into the primitive quiet of\nthe place, gave a sharp, far-reaching call. The sound had scarcely\nrung through the grove when from about a dozen of the little grass\nhouses dotted here and there fifteen or twenty men armed with bolos\ncame out and gathered around the old man. A sense of my danger flashed\nupon me. Three miles from town and alone in a tropical jungle, I could\nbe almost instantly overcome by this band of bolo-men, and the only\nreport that would ever reach my people would be that I had\n\"disappeared.\" Of course, attack was by no means certain, but the\npotentiality of the situation was thrilling. A drawn revolver and the\ngleaming of its shining barrel had the effect of stopping the men, who\nseemed to be hesitating as to a course of action, until a somewhat\ndignified retreat was made to an open space in the rear from where a\nless dignified and a more hasty retreat began which did not stop short\nof Bacalod.\n\nEnough had been seen, however, even in this short visit, to give\nconvincing proof that the settlement visited was no colony of lepers;\nso, that afternoon two servant boys being taken as guides and\ninterpreters, another attempt was made to reach the goal desired.\n\nThis attempt was successful, and, after about two hours of walking, a\nlittle cluster of grass huts snugly hidden by the sea-coast came into\nview. As we approached, one would have thought it a gala-day. Some few\nchildren, apparently from six to thirteen years of age, almost wholly\nnude, were romping and playing in the open space around which the huts\nstood, and no one would ever have thought that any cloud so horrible\nas leprosy could hover over a place apparently so happy.\n\nBy the side of the path as we passed was a man and his wife setting\nout potato plants. His hands were so puffed and his fingers so short\nthat he could scarcely use them, but he was working along as best he\ncould. His wife's feet were so swollen and twisted that she walked\nonly with the greatest difficulty. We passed them by and entered the\nopen space above referred to.\n\nThe children now saw us, and those of them who could darted away like\nfrightened rabbits, each to his own burrow. An old man who was sitting\nin the warm afternoon sun on the little bamboo platform before his hut\nwas aroused from his lethargic repose by the scampering away of the\nchildren. He arose, trembling upon his tottering limbs, all drawn and\ntwisted, and hobbled away into his hut.\n\nThe children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at\nthe doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of\nthe settlement. In a few moments we were surrounded by a circle of\nhuman beings at once so repulsive and so pitiable that its graphic\nvividness can never be accurately portrayed.\n\nThe old man referred to above, having put on a pair of snow-white\npantaloons, appeared now at the doorway of his hut, followed a few\nmoments later by his wife who had evidently clothed herself in the\nbest raiment she had. At a call from the old man, all the men, women,\nand children in the settlement came out of their huts and stood in a\nline before us. The old man was spokesman and in his native visayan\ntongue made a heart-rending appeal for aid which we were powerless to\ngive. Attention was called to a leper woman, apparently about\ntwenty-five years of age, whose face had been attacked by the disease\nand whose appearance was truly pathetic. Upon her hip was a child\nabout a year and a half old and, strange to say, the child showed as\nyet no signs whatever of the disease.\n\nWhat an indissoluble enigma is life! Here in a little cluster of grass\nhuts in a secluded nook of a secluded island of an all but secluded\narchipelago was gathered together a little community of wretched\nnatives, driven by their loathsomeness from association with others\neven of the same half-savage race. Yet here, men and women loved and\nwere married, by mutual trust if not by law, and children were born of\nthe union to live forever under the unspeakable horror that\novershadowed the unfortunate parents. Love, hatred, sorrow, and\njoy--every passion that enters into the complex structure of the human\nheart even here, in this scene of sadness and despair, was playing\napparently as freely as where misfortune and disease had never crossed\nthe portals of life.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER IX. - A \"HIKE.\"\n\n\nWe were lounging lazily in our hammocks at Jimamaylan one evening in\nApril. Supper was just ended, and the soldiers in the post were\ncollected in groups here and there spinning yarns to pass away the\ntime, when a Filipino clad only in a loin cloth came down the street\nat a steadily swinging run and stopped in front of the sentry. He\nbrought the announcement that a band of ladrones had just burned a\nsugar mill and were advancing to sack a barrio about fifteen miles\naway.\n\nThe invitation of the commanding officer to go on a \"hike\" was eagerly\naccepted, and, in ten minutes after the message was given, the troops\nwere on the march followed by two adventurous pedagogues.\n\nDarkness was just closing in as we left the town, but a resplendent\ntropic moon soon made the night almost as brilliant as the day. The\ntrail we followed led over rough and rocky country. Sometimes for a\ndistance of a mile or more we passed over barren wastes of volcanic\nslag poured out in anger by some peak whose convulsions have long\nsince ceased. Again we would descend into a tropical jungle from the\ndense foliage of which the ladrones could have leaped at any moment,\nhad they known of our coming, and annihilated our little band. We\nforded rapid streams with the water at our breasts, and halted only\nonce in that rapid march of fifteen miles.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the town we met a man who was standing\nguard against a surprise by the ladrones. Nothing could well have been\nmuch more grotesque and nothing could much better illustrate the\nabsolutely primitive condition of the Filipinos in the interior of the\nislands than the appearance of this guard. A pair of knee pants, a\nconical grass hat, and a hemp shirt formed his entire apparel. A long\nflat wooden shield, a bolo, and a long bamboo spear with a sharp,\nflat, iron point, completed his equipment for battle.\n\nHere stood the first and the twentieth centuries side by side. The\nFilipino who had advanced only a stage beyond the condition of\nprimitive man with his knife, spear, and wooden shield, stood side by\nside with the American soldier, a representative of modern life with\nhis magazine rifle, his canteen, his knapsack,--with every article of\nhis clothing made to give him the highest possible efficiency as the\nunit of a military organization.\n\nA few yards farther on we met another guard equipped similarly to the\nfirst. Upon reaching the town, news had just been received that a\ndetachment of troops from another post had intercepted the ladrones\nand fought a skirmish with them. The ladrones had escaped and we set\nout in pursuit of them on a chase wilder than a Quixotic dream. We\nwound our way into the mountains behind the town, inquiring at every\ngrass hut we passed whether the band of ladrones had passed that way,\nbut only once was even a trace of them found. Then it was learned that\nat a certain place they had separated into groups of three or four and\ngone glimmering through the dream of things that were. This place was\nin a secluded nook of the mountains where in years gone by some\nadventurous Spaniard had erected a primitive water mill to grind his\nsugar-cane. We had now marched about twenty miles and the feet of the\npedagogues were a mass of blisters. They had reached the point where\nthat form of military maneuvering called \"hiking\" ceased to possess\nany alluring charms. So a native was persuaded to come out of his lone\nmountain hut and hitch up his carabao and cart. He was then made to\nget on the carabao's back, while the aforesaid pedagogues lay down on\nthe sugar-cane pulp that had been put into the body of the cart, and\nthe driver was instructed to start for the post we had left hours\nbefore, and not to stop until he got there. Being uncertain but that\nsome of the ladrones would learn of our having left the body of troops\nand would try the metal of our steel, we at first agreed that neither\nof us should go to sleep, but it was later decided that probably the\ndriver had no greater desire to cross the Styx than his passengers had\nand that in case of danger he would awaken us, so both took a revolver\nin each hand, stretched out supinely and went to sleep.\n\nSuch a sleep! The rough jolting of the cart over an almost impassable\nroad was never enough to break the spell of slumber. When we awoke the\nblazing tropic sun was past the midday mark of morning, shining full\ninto our unprotected and well-nigh blistered faces.\n\nA pack of dogs were heralding our approach to a little village at the\nfoot of the mountains where ponies were procured to take us back to\nthe post."

                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently\nno time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth dimension of Space\nas a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house\nbecame quite quiet.\n\nOn reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up\nagainst a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realize\nhis position. Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\nhundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the\nDowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone\ninto hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains on\none of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who\nhad been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr\nto nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair\nby the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six\nweeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become\nreconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that\nnotorious sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible\nnight when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his\ndressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and\nconfessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox\nout of \u00a350,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card, and swore that\nthe ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back\nto him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because\nhe had seen a green hand tapping at the window-pane, to the beautiful\nLady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round\nher throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin,\nand who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of the\nKing's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he went\nover his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as\nhe recalled to mind his last appearance as \"Red Reuben, or the Strangled\nBabe,\" his d\u00e9but as \"Guant Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,\"\n\nand the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely\nplaying ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And\nafter all this some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him\nthe Rising Sun Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite\nunbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever been treated in this\nmanner. Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance, and remained till\ndaylight in an attitude of deep thought.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III\n\n\nThe next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed\nthe ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. \"I have\nno wish,\" he said, \"to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say\nthat, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,\"--a very just remark,\nat which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.\n\n\"Upon the other hand,\" he continued, \"if he really declines to use the\nRising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him. It\nwould be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside\nthe bedrooms.\"\n\nFor the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the\nblood-stain on the library floor. This certainly was very strange, as\nthe door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept\nclosely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a\ngood deal of comment. Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red,\nthen it would be vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came\ndown for family prayers, according to the simple rites of the Free\nAmerican Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright\nemerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party\nvery much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening. The\nonly person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia, who,\nfor some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the\nsight of the blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was\nemerald-green.\n\nThe second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in\nthe hall. Rushing down-stairs, they found that a large suit of old\narmour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone\nfloor, while seated in a high-backed chair was the Canterville ghost,\nrubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face. The\ntwins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged\ntwo pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained\nby long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United\nStates Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in\naccordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost\nstarted up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a\nmist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so\nleaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase\nhe recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of\ndemoniac laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely\nuseful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single\nnight, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French\ngovernesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly\nlaughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and\nrang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door\nopened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown. \"I am\nafraid you are far from well,\" she said, \"and have brought you a bottle\nof Doctor Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a\nmost excellent remedy.\" The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at\nonce to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an\naccomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family\ndoctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's\nuncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps,\nhowever, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself\nwith becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep\nchurchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.\n\nOn reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the\nmost violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross\nmaterialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what\nreally distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit\nof mail. He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by\nthe sight of a Spectre in armour, if for no more sensible reason, at\nleast out of respect for their natural poet Longfellow, over whose\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\nhour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides it was his own suit.\n\nHe had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament, and had\nbeen highly complimented on it by no less a person than the Virgin Queen\nherself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely overpowered\nby the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen\nheavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees severely, and\nbruising the knuckles of his right hand.\n\nFor some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of\nhis room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.\n\nHowever, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to\nmake a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his\nfamily. He selected Friday, August 17th, for his appearance, and spent\nmost of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in\nfavour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet\nfrilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards evening a\nviolent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was\njust such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to\nmake his way quietly to Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the\nfoot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\nof low music. He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville\nblood-stain by means of Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent. Having reduced\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and\nhis wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead,\nwhile he hissed into her trembling husband's ear the awful secrets of\nthe charnel-house. With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made\nup his mind. She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and\ngentle. A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more\nthan sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the\ncounterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins, he was quite\ndetermined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be done was, of\ncourse, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling\nsensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each\nother, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse,\ntill they became paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw off the\nwinding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white, bleached bones and\none rolling eyeball, in the character of \"Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's\nSkeleton,\" a r\u00f4le in which he had on more than one occasion produced a\ngreat effect, and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of\n\"Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.\"\n\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the\nlight-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves\nbefore they retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still,\nand, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the\nwindow-panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family\nslept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\ncould hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States. He\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his\nmurdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like\nan evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.\n\nOnce he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only\nthe baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange\nsixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\nin the midnight air. Finally he reached the corner of the passage that\nled to luckless Washington's room. For a moment he paused there, the\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's\nshroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was\ncome. He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had\nhe done so than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid\nhis blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was\nstanding a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous\nas a madman's dream! Its head was bald and burnished; its face round,\nand fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\nfeatures into an eternal grin. From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\nlight, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like\nto his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form. On its breast\nwas a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of\nshame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime,\nand, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\n\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's\njack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler. Once in the\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small\npallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes. After a time, however,\nthe brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to\ngo and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight. Accordingly,\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling\nthat, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid\nof his new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins. On reaching\nthe spot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had\nevidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from\nits hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it\nwas leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable\nattitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his\nhorror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a\nrecumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity\nbed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow\nturnip lying at his feet! Unable to understand this curious\ntransformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there,\nin the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:--\n        +------------------------------------+\n        |         YE OTIS GHOSTE             |\n        | Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook, |\n        |    Beware of Ye Imitationes.       |\n        |   All others are counterfeite.     |\n        +------------------------------------+\nThe whole thing flashed across him. He had been tricked, foiled, and\nout-witted! The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his\ntoothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his\nhead, swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\nschool, that, when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds\nof blood would be wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.\n\nHardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of\na distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh,\nand waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\nreason, did not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back\nto his room, thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose. There he\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was\nexceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which this oath\nhad been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second time. \"Perdition\nseize the naughty fowl,\" he muttered, \"I have seen the day when, with my\nstout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow\nfor me an 'twere in death!\" He then retired to a comfortable lead\ncoffin, and stayed there till evening.\n\n\nCHAPTER: IV\n\n\nThe next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were\ncompletely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five\ndays he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point\nof the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want\nit, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a\nlow, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating\nthe symbolic value of sensuous phenomena. The question of phantasmic\napparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a\ndifferent matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large\noriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every month, and he\ndid not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is\nquite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand,\nhe was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.\n\nFor the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as\nusual between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible\nprecaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots,\ntrod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large\nblack velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for\noiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good\ndeal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of\nprotection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he\nslipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a\nlittle humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see\nthat there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a\ncertain degree, it served his purpose. Still in spite of everything he\nwas not left unmolested. Strings were continually being stretched across\nthe corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion,\nwhile dressed for the part of \"Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley\nWoods,\" he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide,\nwhich the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry\nChamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged\nhim, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and\nsocial position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the\nnext night in his celebrated character of \"Reckless Rupert, or the\nHeadless Earl.\"\n\nHe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in\nfact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means\nof it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord\nCanterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome\nJack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\ndown the terrace at twilight. Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\nLord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken\nheart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it\nhad been a great success. It was, however an extremely difficult\n\"make-up,\" if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more\nscientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three\nhours to make his preparations. At last everything was ready, and he was\nvery pleased with his appearance. The big leather riding-boots that went\nwith the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\nfind one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite\nsatisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting\nand crept down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins,\nwhich I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of\nthe colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make\nan effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water\nfell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his\nleft shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed. The shock to his\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\ncould go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold. The only\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\nhad not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences\nmight have been very serious.\n\nHe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,\nand contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in\nlist slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\ndraughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the\ntwins. The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September. He\nhad gone down-stairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that\nthere, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing\nhimself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of\nthe United States Minister and his wife which had now taken the place of\nthe Canterville family pictures. He was simply but neatly clad in a long\nshroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip\nof yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In\nfact, he was dressed for the character of \"Jonas the Graveless, or the\nCorpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,\" one of his most remarkable\nimpersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to\nremember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their\nneighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a quarter-past two o'clock in\nthe morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring. As\nhe was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any\ntraces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a\ndark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads,\nand shrieked out \"BOO!\" in his ear.\n\nSeized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural,\nhe rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him\nthere with the big garden-syringe, and being thus hemmed in by his\nenemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the\ngreat iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to\nmake his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own\nroom in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.\n\nAfter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins\nlay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\nservants, but it was of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings\nwere so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed\nhis great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had\nbeen engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized a wonderful\nclam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse\neuchre, poker, and other American national games, and Virginia rode\nabout the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire,\nwho had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville\nChase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in\nfact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who,\nin reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best\ncongratulations to the Minister's worthy wife.\n\nThe Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the\nhouse, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let\nmatters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the\nyoung Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had\nonce bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice\nwith the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the\nfloor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state that, though\nhe lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but\n\"Double Sixes.\" The story was well known at the time, though, of course,\nout of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt\nwas made to hush it up, and a full account of all the circumstances\nconnected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle's\nRecollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends. The ghost, then,\nwas naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence\nover the Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his\nown first cousin having been married en secondes noces to the Sieur de\nBulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are\nlineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to\nVirginia's little lover in his celebrated impersonation of \"The Vampire\nMonk, or the Bloodless Benedictine,\" a performance so horrible that when\nold Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in\nthe year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which\nculminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after\ndisinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and\nleaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment,\nhowever, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the\nlittle Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal\nBedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.\n\n\nCHAPTER: V\n\n\nA few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out\nriding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting\nthrough a hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go\nup by the back staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past\nthe Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied\nshe saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother's maid, who\nsometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend\nher habit. To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville\nGhost himself! He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of\nthe yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing\nmadly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his hand, and his\nwhole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so forlorn, and so\nmuch out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea\nhad been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity,\nand determined to try and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so\ndeep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she\nspoke to him.\n\n\"I am so sorry for you,\" she said, \"but my brothers are going back to\nEton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy\nyou.\"\n\n\"It is absurd asking me to behave myself,\" he answered, looking round in\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,\n\"quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and\nwalk about at night, if that is what you mean. It is my only reason for\nexisting.\"\n\n\"It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very\nwicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had\nkilled your wife.\"\n\n\"Well, I quite admit it,\" said the Ghost, petulantly, \"but it was a\npurely family matter, and concerned no one else.\"\n\n\"It is very wrong to kill any one,\" said Virginia, who at times had a\nsweet puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.\n\n\"Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very\nplain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about\ncookery. Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent\npricket, and do you know how she had it sent to table? However, it is\nno matter now, for it is all over, and I don't think it was very nice of\nher brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.\"\n\n\"Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost--I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry? I\nhave a sandwich in my case. Would you like it?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you,\nall the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\nvulgar, dishonest family.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Virginia, stamping her foot, \"it is you who are rude, and\nhorrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the\npaints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain\nin the library. First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and\nI couldn't do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the\nchrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese\nwhite, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing\nto look at, and not at all easy to paint. I never told on you, though I\nwas very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for\nwho ever heard of emerald-green blood?\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" said the Ghost, rather meekly, \"what was I to do? It is\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother\nbegan it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I\nshould not have your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of\ntaste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest\nin England; but I know you Americans don't care for things of this\nkind.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\nand improve your mind. My father will be only too happy to give you a\nfree passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind,\nthere will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are\nall Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\nhave a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family ghost.\"\n\n\"I don't think I should like America.\"\n\n\"I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,\" said Virginia,\nsatirically.\n\n\"No ruins! no curiosities!\" answered the Ghost; \"you have your navy and\nyour manners.\"\n\n\"Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week's\nholiday.\"\n\n\"Please don't go, Miss Virginia,\" he cried; \"I am so lonely and so\nunhappy, and I really don't know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I\ncannot.\"\n\n\"That's quite absurd! You have merely to go to bed and blow out the\ncandle. It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\nchurch, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why, even\nbabies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.\"\n\n\"I have not slept for three hundred years,\" he said sadly, and\nVirginia's beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; \"for three hundred\nyears I have not slept, and I am so tired.\"\n\nVirginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like\nrose-leaves. She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked\nup into his old withered face.\n\n\"Poor, poor Ghost,\" she murmured; \"have you no place where you can\nsleep?\"\n\n\"Far away beyond the pine-woods,\" he answered, in a low, dreamy voice,\n\"there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\nsings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold crystal\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\nsleepers.\"\n\nVirginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\n\n\"You mean the Garden of Death,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth,\nwith the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have\nno yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at\npeace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of death's\nhouse, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death\nis.\"\n\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\nthere was silence. She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\n\nThen the ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of\nthe wind.\n\n\"Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?\"\n\n\"Oh, often,\" cried the little girl, looking up; \"I know it quite well.\n\nIt is painted in curious black letters, and is difficult to read. There\nare only six lines:\n    \"'When a golden girl can win\n    Prayer from out the lips of sin,\n    When the barren almond bears,\n    And a little child gives away its tears,\n    Then shall all the house be still\n    And peace come to Canterville.'\n\n\"But I don't know what they mean.\"\n\n\"They mean,\" he said, sadly, \"that you must weep with me for my sins,\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle,\nthe angel of death will have mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\ncannot prevail.\"\n\nVirginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair\nas he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes. \"I am not afraid,\" she said\nfirmly, \"and I will ask the angel to have mercy on you.\"\n\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as\nhe led her across the dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were\nbroidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back. \"Go back! little Virginia,\"\n\nthey cried, \"go back!\" but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly,\nand she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails\nand goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and\nmurmured, \"Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,\"\n\nbut the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When\nthey reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she\ncould not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly\nfading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A\nbitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her\ndress. \"Quick, quick,\" cried the Ghost, \"or it will be too late,\" and\nin a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry\nChamber was empty.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VI\n\n\nAbout ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not\ncome down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia\nanywhere. As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\nevening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all\nalarmed at first, but when six o'clock struck, and Virginia did not\nappear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for\nher, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house. At\nhalf-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\nof their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of\nexcitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly\nremembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies\npermission to camp in the park. He accordingly at once set off for\nBlackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son\nand two of the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire, who was\nperfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too,\nbut Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a\nscuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gipsies had\ngone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as\nthe fire was still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.\n\nHaving sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran\nhome, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the\ncounty, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been\nkidnapped by tramps or gipsies. He then ordered his horse to be brought\nround, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down\nto dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with a groom. He had hardly,\nhowever, gone a couple of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after\nhim, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with\nhis face very flushed, and no hat. \"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,\" gasped\nout the boy, \"but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.\n\nPlease don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year,\nthere would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me back,\nwill you? I can't go! I won't go!\"\n\nThe Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace,\nand was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down\nfrom his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, \"Well,\nCecil, if you won't go back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must\nget you a hat at Ascot.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!\" cried the little Duke, laughing,\nand they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of\nthe station-master if any one answering to the description of Virginia\nhad been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her. The\nstation-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him\nthat a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a\nhat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his\nshutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away,\nwhich he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as there was a\nlarge common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman, but\ncould get no information from him, and, after riding all over the\ncommon, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase\nabout eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found\nWashington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with\nlanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest trace of\nVirginia had been discovered. The gipsies had been caught on Brockley\nmeadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they should be late. Indeed, they had\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's disappearance, as they\nwere very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his\npark, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search.\n\nThe carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone\nover, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any\nrate, Virginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest\ndepression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they\nfound a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\nwas poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and\nhaving her forehead bathed with eau de cologne by the old housekeeper.\n\nMr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up\nsupper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one\nspoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very\nfond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the\nentreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that\nnothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in\nthe morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down\nimmediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight\nbegan to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded\nthey heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder\nshook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a\npanel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out\non the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her\nhand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs.\nOtis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with\nviolent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.\n\n\"Good heavens! child, where have you been?\" said Mr. Otis, rather\nangrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them.\n\n\"Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and\nyour mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these\npractical jokes any more.\"\n\n\"Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!\" shrieked the twins, as they\ncapered about.\n\n\"My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side\nagain,\" murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair.\n\n\"Papa,\" said Virginia, quietly, \"I have been with the Ghost. He is dead,\nand you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was\nreally sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of\nbeautiful jewels before he died.\"\n\nThe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave\nand serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a\nlighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they\ncame to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia\ntouched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves\nin a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated\nwindow. Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was\na gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone\nfloor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers\nan old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its\nreach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was\ncovered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but\na pile of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding\nher little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the\nparty looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\ndisclosed to them.\n\n\"Hallo!\" suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out\nof the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\nsituated. \"Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.\"\n\n\"God has forgiven him,\" said Virginia, gravely, as she rose to her feet,\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.\n\n\"What an angel you are!\" cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round\nher neck, and kissed her.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VII\n\n\nFour days after these curious incidents, a funeral started from\nCanterville Chase at about eleven o'clock at night. The hearse was drawn\nby eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\nnodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\npurple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville\ncoat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\nservants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully\nimpressive. Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up\nspecially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first\ncarriage along with little Virginia. Then came the United States\nMinister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the\nlast carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had\nbeen frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she\nhad a right to see the last of him. A deep grave had been dug in the\ncorner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service\nwas read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, the servants, according to an old custom\nobserved in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as\nthe coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward,\nand laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms. As\nshe did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its\nsilent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a\nnightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of the\nGarden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a\nword during the drive home.\n\nThe next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given\nto Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby\nnecklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen\nof sixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis\nfelt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"I know that in this country mortmain is held to\napply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that\nthese jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg\nyou, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you\nunder certain strange conditions. As for my daughter, she is merely a\nchild, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such\nappurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I\nmay say, is no mean authority upon Art,--having had the privilege of\nspending several winters in Boston when she was a girl,--that these gems\nare of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\nprice. Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you\nwill recognize how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\nin the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such\nvain gauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\nBritish aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who\nhave been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles\nof Republican simplicity. Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box, as a memento of\nyour unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is extremely old, and\nconsequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to\ncomply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good deal\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with medi\u00e6valism\nin any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was\nborn in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned\nfrom a trip to Athens.\"\n\nLord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister's speech,\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile,\nand when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\nsaid: \"My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky\nancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are\nmuch indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck. The jewels\nare clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough\nto take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave\nin a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. As for their being\nheirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or\nlegal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite\nunknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and\nwhen Miss Virginia grows up, I dare say she will be pleased to have\npretty things to wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the\nfurniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to\nthe ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity\nSir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he\nwas really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase.\"\n\nMr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville's refusal, and\nbegged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was\nquite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to\nretain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of\n1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's first\ndrawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the\nuniversal theme of admiration. For Virginia received the coronet, which\nis the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her\nboy-lover as soon as he came of age. They were both so charming, and\nthey loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the\nmatch, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch\nthe Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less\nthan three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to\nsay, Mr. Otis himself. Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke\npersonally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his\nown words, \"was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating\ninfluences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of\nRepublican simplicity should be forgotten.\" His objections, however,\nwere completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the\naisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his\narm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of\nEngland.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to\nCanterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over\nin the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods. There had\nbeen a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir\nSimon's tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it\nsimply the initials of the old gentleman's name, and the verse from the\nlibrary window. The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses,\nwhich she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for\nsome time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There\nthe Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her\nfeet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly\nhe threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her,\n\"Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.\"\n\n\"Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have,\" he answered, smiling, \"you have never told me what\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.\"\n\n\"I have never told any one, Cecil,\" said Virginia, gravely.\n\n\"I know that, but you might tell me.\"\n\n\"Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you. Poor Sir Simon! I owe\nhim a great deal. Yes, don't laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see\nwhat Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than\nboth.\"\n\nThe Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.\n\n\"You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,\" he murmured.\n\n\"You have always had that, Cecil.\"\n\n\"And you will tell our children some day, won't you?\"\n\nVirginia blushed.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.\n\nYet Millet would have us understand that in spite of this, the\nshepherd is performing a duty to humanity not to be underrated. The\nsheep he has so carefully and conscientiously reared will form food\nto-morrow for many a hungry town-dweller. Further, he would have us\nfollow the peasant as he closes the pen for the night and traces his\ntired steps towards his simple home in the village. The frugal and\nhard-earned meal, prepared for him by his wife, who like himself has\nhad her share of duties to occupy her during the day, is partaken of\nsurrounded by a hungry and joyous group of children. Such themes\nsuggested by the simplicity of his own life appealed to him with\nirresistible force, and it is in their portrayal that his greatness is\nmanifested.\n\nPerhaps no season of the year presented the same attraction for Millet\nas the spring. The period when all the earth after its long winter\nsleep is about to waken into new life seems to have always been a\nsource of inspiration to him. In \"The Sower\" he emphasises the fact\nthat the fruits of the harvest are not to be had without due labour\nbeing expended upon the earth. The sloping field, barren of\nvegetation, and crowned at the top with a small clump of trees, is\nbeing broken up by the distant plough drawn by two horses and guided\nby a peasant. The latter figure is one of the noblest of Millet's\ncreations. By his strained and ever-attentive attitude, by his\ncontinuous tramp over the rough and broken ground, he shows us the\nmonotony of his toil. He crosses the field in one direction, only to\nreturn at an interval of a few feet. In the foreground we have the\nsower, a middle-aged man of typical peasant type, on whose left side a\nbag of seeds is slung. With automatic precision he withdraws a\nhandful, and strews it into the furrows open to receive it. So long as\nhe continues in the same track his labour will be well performed, and\nhence his task is just as monotonous as that of his fellow-worker\nhigher up in the field. The silhouetting of these two figures against\nthe light is symbolical of the labour to be expended in life before\nresults are forthcoming.\n\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that in considering the works of\nMillet, one must not judge him from the standpoint of a mere painter.\n\nHis brush is only the means to an end, and by its means he is enabled\nto bring the fruits of his philosophic observation before us in\npermanent form. It has been charged against the \"Angelus\" that it was\nnot a remarkably fine piece of painting, that many a young artist of\nthe present generation is infinitely better equipped, technically\nspeaking, than the master who wrought this celebrated canvas. This may\nin a measure be true, but it must never be forgotten that Millet\nbrought into play exactly the means which could illustrate his meaning\nin the clearest terms. He had not intended, in painting such a\npicture, to produce a work which would astonish his fellow artists\nwith its brilliancy of handling or magnificence of colour. He wanted\nto make the beholder forget the painter and absorb the lesson. This\nquality runs right through the art of Millet, and it is from this\nstandpoint that we are obliged to weigh his merits.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE\n\n\nJean Fran\u00e7ois Millet was born on October 4, 1814, that is at the\nperiod when French art, at any rate as far as landscape painting is\nconcerned, had reached its lowest ebb. Throughout the eighteenth\ncentury the landscape painter had been hard put to make a living. The\ntaste of connoisseurs throughout the century had been for portraits\nand interiors, or for those numerous pastoral subjects which were\ncarried out with so much decorative charm by such men as Watteau and\nBoucher. Such landscape painting as existed was of the type\npopularised by Vernet; it was built upon a curious mixture of Italian\ninfluence coming from Panini and Salvator Rosa. The only evidence of\nrevolt against such a state of affairs we find in the works of Hubert\nRobert and Moreau. These two, and more especially would I direct the\nreader's attention to the latter, struggled hard to break down the\nconventionalities of the time. They endeavoured to infuse some sense\nof atmosphere into their pictures, and whilst frequently their trees\nand figures are painfully formal, they yet stand alone in the French\nschool as the pioneers of a phase of art which was to attain its\nzenith in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBut after the Revolution, and during the whole of the time that France\nwas under the domination of Napoleon, very rigid principles indeed\nwere enforced with regard to the direction that art should take. The\ninnovation which had its commencement in the reign of Louis XVI. swept\neverything before it as it gained force. Classical art and traditions\ndominated the whole French school, and no artist, however great his\nreputation, attempted for many years to swim against the stream. In\nspite of the principles of liberty and equality which were claimed for\nall under the new r\u00e9gime, a terribly strict eye was kept upon any\ninnovations which might break out in the form of a naturalistic art.\n\nThe directors of this new movement failed to see that the conditions\nwhich had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed\naway, and that the latter's supremacy was due to the fact that their\nproductions were symbolical of the loftiest thoughts of their own\nepoch. The art which expresses the ambitions and noblest thoughts of\nits time will alone endure. These expressions are not applicable to\nany other condition than those which called them forth, and hence in\nattempting to purify the rococo which had existed up to the middle of\nthe eighteenth century, by a return to classical traditions, they were\nonly copying that which their predecessors had done, and in so doing\nleft us without any original expression of their own time.\n\nInto such a condition of affairs was Millet born, and he was numbered\namongst that little band of men which included Rousseau, Corot, Dupr\u00e9,\nDiaz, and Daumier, who were to lay the foundations of the modern\nnaturalistic school. At the outset it was seemingly a hopeless\nstruggle they undertook; a struggle against prejudice and influence\nwhich was only to be brought to a victorious culmination after years\nof struggle and disappointment. Of this little band, Millet was\nperhaps the best equipped for the privations which were necessary. He\ncame of a peasant stock who inhabited Gruchy, a small village\nsituated in the commune of Gr\u00e9ville, close to Cherbourg. Grouped\nunderneath the humble roof was the grandmother, who had been left a\nwidow fifteen years before; her son, Jean Louis Nicolas Millet, and\nhis wife and eight children, of which our artist was the second. His\ngrandmother appears to have been a pious old lady, whose chief delight\nwas in her grandchildren, to whom she taught those religious\nprinciples which stood them in good stead in after life. We are told\nthat Millet's father possessed a force of character one does not often\nfind amongst men in his rank of life. He was of a contemplative\ndisposition, and had a keenly developed feeling for natural beauty. He\npossessed moreover a keen appreciation of music, which unfortunately\nhe does not appear to have had much opportunity of cultivating. His\nwife was an excellent housewife and of a religious turn of mind. The\nhouse they occupied, situated quite a short distance from the sea, was\nplaced in a tract of country which, whilst it had rugged and\npicturesque features, was not of a nature which would yield\nextraordinary results under cultivation. It was, therefore, a hard\nstruggle for existence which Millet in his first years saw going\non around him. Not that the family were any the less happy for having\nto work laboriously for their livelihood. They had been brought up\namidst such surroundings; their wants were simple and easily\ngratified, and the tranquillity of the m\u00e9nage more than\ncounterbalanced those doubtful luxuries which easier circumstances\nwould have brought their way. Throughout his life Millet maintained\nthe extreme simplicity he had seen practised in the home of his\nchildhood, and long years afterwards he was accustomed to look back\nwith pleasureable memories upon his early years.\n\nGruchy, situated in one of the wildest parts of Normandy, feels the\nfull effect of every storm which blows up from the Atlantic. There is\nnothing to shelter the exposed hamlets studded along the coast from\nthe fury of the western gale, and the rocks are but too often strewn\nwith the wrecks of vessels which have come to grief in that terrible\nsea. Millet in his youth must have witnessed many of these\ncatastrophes. Quite a number of drawings by him are extant\nrepresenting succour being extended to some vessel in difficulties, or\nthe hauling up of some wreckage on to the rocks. The studious boy\nmust have been impressed as he saw the sternness of the combat in his\nnative country between men and nature; the wind-swept fields, and\nhills bare to the point of savageness. The very trees themselves\ndwarfed and gnarled; in their struggle with the elements they have\nbeen made tough and hardy as the inhabitants of the country\nthemselves, and, stunted as they are, yet show well that they can\nresist the force of the fiercest storm. The brooding and contemplative\ncharacter of the father having descended to the son, we can quite\nimagine the effect such surroundings would have upon him. As he looked\nback in after years upon his roamings in his native country, he\nappreciated the awe-inspiring character of the scenery in which he had\nbeen born. He would doubtless recall many a walk amidst the fields\nwith the wind blowing in his face as it rushed in from the Atlantic,\nthe rain beating hard upon the freshly ploughed fields, and the\ndistant figure of the ploughman struggling hard with his team against\nthe stiff sou'wester. The great mass of vapour overhead whirled before\nthe violence of the storm, casting grey and pearly light over the\nwhole scene, whilst far away on the top of the hill a clump of trees,\nbent with their resistance to the wind, are silhouetted against the\nsky. Many a drawing of this kind we encounter in the later work of\nMillet, which shows how his thoughts harked back in certain moments to\nthe scenes he had left behind him for ever.\n\nWe know that on one or two occasions he returned to Gruchy. Once or\ntwice he had urgent business which took him back, but sometimes he\nwent with no other purpose than to renew acquaintance with the scenes\nof yore.\n\nLittle Jean Fran\u00e7ois was his grandmother's favourite. It was she who\ntaught him the names of things which surrounded him, and perhaps\ndirected his thoughts in the channels to which they were finally to be\ndevoted. Her brother Charles, who formed one of the family, used to\ntake him for walks, telling him stories on the way. Millet was\ndevotedly attached to this old man, and when at the age of seven years\nhe lost him, the gap in his life thus left made an impression upon his\nmemory never to be effaced.\n\nFive years afterwards he was placed in the hands of the vicar for the\npurpose of preparing him for his first communion. The good man seems\nto have been taken with the child; he found him so attentive to all\nnatural phenomenon which was passing around him and intelligent in an\nunusual degree. He quickly learnt a considerable amount of Latin,\nwhich introduced him to the great classics. Unfortunately for Millet,\nthe vicar accepted an offer of transference to a better parish in the\nvicinity. The boy had made such progress with his master that it was\ndecided that he should go with him to his new abode. He was, however,\nso missed in his own home, that when he came back for his first\nholidays it was decided that he should not return.\n\nHe now gave serious attention to the agricultural pursuits of his\nfather. He threw himself heartily into the work of the farm, and\nassisted in the work of sowing and harvesting, of pruning and\nthrashing according to the season. His spare time was occupied in\nreading with avidity various masterpieces of literature. The authors\nhe found at hand were such as F\u00e9n\u00e9lon and Bossuet, but he developed a\ndecided preference, which lasted till the end of his life, for Virgil\nand the Bible.\n\nIt was at this time that his taste for art began to be developed.\n\nHe drew the objects he found around him, and soon acquired sufficient\nconfidence in his skill to execute a large drawing representing two\nshepherds keeping guard over their sheep. These first efforts date\nfrom about his seventeenth year, and foretell the advent of the style\nin which he was later to become pre-eminent.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE MIGRATION TO PARIS\n\n\nHow frequently has it happened that the first years in the life of a\ngenius have been employed in labour quite different from that to which\nthey should have been directed. Such a state of affairs the more often\noccurs when the sense of duty has been strong enough to overcome\ntemporarily the inclination to pursue the natural bent. In the case of\nMillet, however, the early years which he devoted to the farm and its\npursuits were by no means wasted. It is on record that he became very\nproficient in the various duties in which he was engaged, but at the\nsame time we can be quite sure that his extraordinary faculties of\nobservation were constantly being brought into play, and the fruits of\nhis observations are to be seen in the pictures of his mature period.\n\nA considerable portion of his spare time was taken up with drawing,\nnot only the persons and objects he found around him, but also\nsubjects suggested to him by the books he was in the habit of reading.\n\nHis family, so far from throwing any obstacles in his way, encouraged\nhim. In fact it was his father who took him first to Cherbourg in\norder to show a painter of that town, named Mouchel, the early\nproducts of his son's genius. The decision at which Millet p\u00e8re had\narrived was prompted by a drawing in charcoal of an old peasant\nwalking along the road, which had struck him forcibly as being a work\nof extraordinary merit. It says much for Mouchel's breadth of mind\nthat he was equally impressed with the drawings. A man who had been\nbrought up in the school of David, and who had lived in one of the\nmost reactionary periods of French art, was hardly to be expected to\ntake kindly to a style so diametrically opposed to all the traditions\ninto which he himself had been inculcated; certainly the young\nMillet, who had now arrived at the age of eighteen, had not developed\nthe extraordinary freedom which his works of ten years later\ndemonstrate. But there was sufficient originality even in his early\ndrawings to call forth condemnation from a man who had been so\nsaturated with the teaching of David.\n\nHe prevailed upon Millet to leave his son with him, and set him to\nwork to copy many well-known works of art which he brought before his\npupil by means of engravings. Two months were spent in this way when\nnews reached Millet that his father had been seized with sudden\nillness, and he was obliged in the circumstances to return to\nGr\u00e9ville. He arrived to find the old man unconscious, and very shortly\nafterwards he died.\n\nThis misfortune awoke in Millet a sense of duty which compelled him to\ndesert his studies in Cherbourg and superintend the management of the\nfarm. For some time he devoted himself entirely to his new duties, but\nthe struggle betwixt duty and genius continued; he gave himself to his\nwork with all the energy at his disposal, but his thoughts were ever\nwandering to his art.\n\nAdded to his own inclinations, his grandmother, who perceived his\nextraordinary gifts, strongly persuaded him to devote his attention\nentirely to art, and consequently after some little time he decided to\nreturn to Cherbourg. Here he entered the studio of M. Langlois, an\nartist whose reputation in the town was considerable. Again in this\nworthy man he came in contact with a painter who had been brought up\nentirely under classical influence. Langlois, who had in his early\ndays been a pupil of Gros, had absorbed the classical tradition to\nsuch an extent as to be incapable of appreciating any other style. He\nappears to have endeavoured to mould Millet in his own method rather\nthan develop the latent genius which the latter possessed. The\nincompatibility of these two men speedily caused the younger to strike\nout in his own way. He saw more good in frequenting the museums and\nmaking copies of such works as appealed to him than in listening to\nthe advice of his teacher. All this occurred, however, without any\nbreach of friendship occurring. On the contrary, Langlois, after\nperceiving the futility of inducing his pupil to follow in his\nfootsteps, did all he could to advance his interests.\n\nBy means of his influence some of Millet's drawings were brought\nbefore the Municipal Council, and Langlois suggested that Millet\nshould be sent to Paris in order to further his development, and that\nthe Council should set aside a modest pension to meet his requirements\nin that city. The discussion appears to have been very prolonged, and\nupon the question being put to a vote it was only carried by means of\nthe casting vote of the mayor. Four hundred francs was at first\nallotted to him in this way, which was further increased shortly\nafterwards to six hundred. Such encouragement, meagre though it was,\nwas sufficient to give him a foothold in the metropolis. He left\nCherbourg in January 1837, on a cold and raw day, the snow falling\nheavily throughout the entire journey, and arrived in Paris in a very\ndisheartened condition. The miserable weather, coupled with the long\njourney in which he had had time to think of the small sum which lay\nbetween him and starvation, going to a city which he had never seen\nbefore, had all served to work upon his nerves, and he entered the\ngreat city sick at heart and very despondent.\n\nOne of the first visits he made after he was somewhat settled down in\nParis was to the Louvre. Here he was brought into contact for the\nfirst time with many masters, who were to mould his yet plastic\ntemperament into the form which enabled him to give to the world, in\nlater years, so many masterpieces. As I have said before, it was\nMantegna who first captivated him, and the influence of the mighty\nPaduan was never finally to be shaken off. Michel Angelo awed him with\nhis sublimity; his classical severity tempered with intense humanism,\nhis masculine strength, were bound to have their effect upon so\nserious a character as Millet. Strange as it may seem to those who are\nbut superficially acquainted with his art, and are only too apt to\njudge him by the influence he has had upon modern French painting, he\nwas fascinated with the antique. The traditions of Phidias and\nPraxiteles, in the form in which they had been transmitted through the\ngreatest minds of the Renaissance, were ever the factors which guided\nhim throughout his career. It was this same spirit which impelled his\nfervid admiration for Nicolas Poussin, a master who to-day is sadly\nunderrated and but little understood. It was the mysteries of line,\nthe wonders of pose and composition rather than the magic of colour\nwhich appealed to him. He had a profound admiration for the glowing\ncanvases of Titian and Rubens, but he could never overlook entirely\ntheir defects of drawing or, in the case of Rubens, the tendency to\nvulgarity. From his remarks in after years it would appear that he was\nbaffled with the mysticisms of Velazquez and Rembrandt; pure painting\nitself could never hold him. He needed to grasp the message which lay\nbehind it before he felt fully taken into the confidence of the\npainter; and as the minds of the Dutchman and the Spaniard ran in\nquite different channels to his own, they spoke with a language he\nnever understood. That he had a perceptive and critically independent\nmind may be gauged from his enthusiasm for Delacroix, whose work he\nencountered for the first time at the Luxembourg.\n\nDuring this period of study he was carefully considering under what\nmaster he should place himself. His choice unhappily fell upon\nDelaroche. To any one acquainted with the work of the latter master,\na more unsuitable selection could not have been made. Delaroche and\nthe painters who surrounded him can be appropriately described as\nconstituting the back-wash of the Empire style, which had reached its\nclimax with David. His subjects were always treated with academic\nreserve. No pyrotechnics were permitted; on the contrary, an\neverlasting and mistaken striving for finish was encouraged:\noriginality was sternly suppressed. To paint human life as it really\nwas, was too vulgar for any of the painters of this time. They held\nthe public taste enslaved for years. An innovator such as Millet was\ndestined to become found his position almost untenable. The band of\ncritics and painters formed a monopoly which it seemed almost\nimpossible to break down, and it was only after years of bitter and\ndetermined struggle that the school of nature finally routed its\nopponent.\n\nDelaroche doubtlessly found the peasant painter a little rude both in\nhis person and in his ideas about art. He paid but little attention to\nthe young man who had placed himself in his hands, and devoted all his\ntime to students who were more amenable to his influence. A\ntemperament so sensitive as Millet's was bound to notice this\nneglect, and consequently after a time he became so discouraged that\nhe ceased to frequent Delaroche's studio. Another very good reason for\nthis action was the lack of resources to continue his payments. Even\nduring the time he had been with Delaroche he lost no opportunity of\nturning a few honest francs by painting the portraits of any who could\nbe got to sit to him. Delaroche, however, had a more kindly heart than\nMillet imagined. He seems to have found out the real distress of the\nyoung artist, and to have assisted him pecuniarily in many ways, and\nthere is no doubt that he appreciated the talent of the young Norman\nmuch more than he cared to own. Many of his remarks on record would\nserve to show that Delaroche already felt that his pupil was destined\nto be one of the leaders of the movement which was finally to\noverthrow his own style, and doubtlessly felt a great admiration for a\nman who had the courage and strength to swim against rather than with\nthe current.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STRUGGLE FOR RECOGNITION\n\n\nFreed from all encumbrances save poverty, Millet was now to work out\nhis own destiny according to the dictates of his genius. He joined a\nfriend named Marolle, and the two together occupying a very small\napartment endeavoured to eke out an existence. It was only too soon\napparent that young as he was, and the taste of the public being not\nyet ready for development upon the lines his genius directed him, that\nhis livelihood could not be secured by endeavouring to sell such\nsubjects as appealed to him. In these straits he turned to\nportrait-painting, just as many great painters before and since him\nhave done. That the struggle was very keen can well be imagined by the\nfact that he was unable to obtain more than five to ten francs apiece;\nand, as commissions were very scarce, he was hard put to gain the\nmeans of subsistence. This state of affairs lasted until 1840, in\nwhich year he endeavoured to obtain admission to the Salon with two\nportraits, one of which was that of his friend. This, however, was\nrejected, and the other picture, although accepted, was unnoticed by\neither the critics or the public.\n\nHaving occasion the next year to pay a visit to Cherbourg, he felt\nobliged to report himself to the Municipal Council who had had the\ngenerosity to send him in the first place to Paris. Its worthy members\nexpressed themselves as but little satisfied with the result of their\ninvestment; they claimed that they had had as yet but little to show\nfor their money, and they suggested, partly as a means of\ndemonstrating that they had had some little return, and also, in order\nto see of what stuff their prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was made, that he should paint a\nportrait of the recently deceased mayor. As Millet had not been\npersonally acquainted with that worthy citizen, and as the only guide\nwhich could be supplied him was a portrait made in miniature when he\nwas a young man of some twenty-three or twenty-four years of age, the\ntask was by no means easy. However, the artist set to work with a\nwill, and finally accomplished the picture to his own satisfaction.\n\nUpon it being shown to the Council, one and all declared, as any one\nwith the slightest knowledge of such matters could have told them\nbefore it was commenced, that it bore not the least resemblance to the\ndefunct magistrate. They therefore demurred at the three hundred\nfrancs they had agreed to pay him for the portrait, and offered him\none-third of that amount instead. Millet was deeply offended by the\ninsult, and informed the Council that he made them a present of the\npicture.\n\nIt was during this short visit to his native country that he met his\nfirst wife, a Mlle. Ono, whose portrait he had painted. From the first\nshe was very delicate, and he lost her after much suffering, three\nyears later. His second wife was Mlle. Catherine Lemaire, who was\ndestined to be the companion of his struggles until the end of his\nlife.\n\nMeanwhile Millet was occupied with subjects which he thought would\nappeal to the general public. A number of classical pictures date from\nthis epoch. It was an endeavour on his part to fall in as far as\npossible with the current taste, and so supply means of subsistence\nfor his family. At the same time he did not neglect his favourite\nsubjects, and many are the wonderful studies of peasant life which\ndate from these years. His reputation had so far advanced that he was\noffered the position of teacher of drawing in the college at\nCherbourg. It must have been only after prolonged deliberation that he\nrefused the proffered post. Here a certain annual stipend was assured\nhim, and if it was not large in itself it would at any rate suffice to\nkeep the wolf from the door. He preferred, however, to return to Paris\nand work out his own destiny as best he might.\n\nMillet, who lived at this time in the Rue Rochechouart, began to\nsurround himself with that little group of friends who remained\nfaithful to him until the end of his career. Amongst the earliest were\nCharles Jacque and Diaz: the latter had several clients amongst the\nsmall dealers, whom he induced to visit Millet's studio and make now\nand again a small purchase.\n\nMillet now became a fairly regular contributor to the Salon, but\ngenerally sent some classical or religious picture as well as one of\nhis peasant subjects. For example, in 1848 he sent the marvellous\nstudy of \"The Winnower,\" which we all know so well, accompanied by a\ncanvas, \"The Captivity of the Jews at Babylon.\" The latter, however,\nwas so badly received that he utilised the canvas upon its return for\na large picture of a \"Shepherdess tending her Sheep.\"\n\nIn spite of the headway that he was making, the struggle for existence\nseemed keener than ever, and but for the kindness of friends he and\nhis family would frequently have actually wanted for food. A timely\nadvance of one hundred francs obtained for him from the Minister of\nFine Arts, together with a commission from the State, for which he was\npaid the sum of eighteen hundred francs, were for some time the only\nrelief he obtained from his embarrassments. That he was not particular\nas to how he earned his daily bread is apparent from the fact that he\ndid not despise an order for a shop sign for a midwife, for which he\nwas paid the miserable amount of thirty francs.\n\nThe year 1848 was not an encouraging one for a painter who was\nstanding on the threshold of his career. The whole of Europe was\nseething with revolution. A repetition of the fearful year of 1792 was\neverywhere expected. The struggle betwixt reaction and property on the\none hand, and lawlessness and revolution on the other, was being waged\nwith grim determination. The issue was for long in the balance. One\nnever knew from one day to another what was going to happen. In such a\ndeplorable state of affairs men's minds were running on politics and\nwars rather than upon art. Millet amongst the rest was called upon to\nshoulder the musket, and it can be easily imagined with what\nreluctance he did so.\n\nParis, the great centre of art, had yet not afforded him much\nencouragement. Life was dear in the big city, and surrounded on all\nsides by bricks and mortar he was not free to go out into the fields\nand study the objects which were uppermost in his mind. He resolved to\nescape from it, and once having put the plan into execution he never\nreturned.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET IN HIS MATURITY\n\n\nThe Barbizon of 1850 was a very different place from the Barbizon of\nto-day. The world fame of the men who passed a quiet and strenuous\nexistence in the little village has transformed it into a tourist\nresort, with restaurants and caf\u00e9s, the stopping-places for\nwaggonettes which in summer bring their daily load of sightseers,\neager to see the homes of the painters whose names are now household\nwords.\n\nIt would have been well-nigh impossible for the little band to have\nchosen a more suitable spot for their labours. Rousseau and Millet,\nmuch as they were drawn towards each other by the tie of a sympathetic\ndisposition and by their common interest in art, yet were widely\ndissimilar from one another in their outlook upon art and their\nmethods of worship at the common shrine. Rousseau--one can see it from\nevery picture he painted--loved with all the yearning of a passionate\nand restless temperament the inanimate in Nature. Observe with what\nfidelity he draws his trees, with what caressing tenderness his clouds\nand skies are treated; solitude appealed to him above all things, and\nif here and there he was obliged to insert a few figures to complete\nhis composition, one instinctively feels that he would rather have\nsubstituted a group of cattle or a flock of sheep. In the glades of\nthe forest, far from the busy haunts of men, with the glorious\nsunlight penetrating from above, the breeze moaning through the\nbranches, he was happy. A wild and turbulent temperament such as his\nnot infrequently discovers exquisite enjoyment amidst such perfect\ntranquillity.\n\nBarbizon, situated on the fringe of the great forest of Fontainebleau,\ntherefore, permitted Rousseau to come into daily contact with the\nscenes which so appealed to him.\n\nMillet, on the other hand, was absorbed in the peasant. The man who\ntilled the soil and raised the produce humanity requires for its\nsubsistence by the sweat of his brow; the manifold duties of the\nlabourer, his life and sorrows, appealed to him with irresistible\nforce. An unpeopled track of wild and uncultivated land would not call\nforth any emotion in him, no matter how sublime the scenery might be.\n\nThe life of the village, spreading itself into the vast and fertile\nplain behind, held him absorbed; a peasant himself and living amongst\nthe people he so loved, he was in a position to bring before an\nunthinking world the poignant monotony of their useful lives.\n\nUpon their first arrival at Barbizon, the two artists put up at a\nsmall inn, working all day in a tiny place they had rented from some\npeasants and fitted up as a studio. The inconveniences of this\narrangement were soon apparent, and shortly afterwards Millet took a\nsmall house which was destined to be his abode for the remainder of\nhis life; an old barn in the immediate vicinity meanwhile provided him\nwith an excellent studio.\n\nFrom this period onward we must date the greatest productions of the\nmaster, the works which have induced more thought than those of any\nother peasant painter. A peasant among peasants, his life was of the\nmost rigid simplicity. Behind his little abode a large garden\nstretched away almost to the fringe of the forest itself, and here he\nwas accustomed to work every morning, growing a portion of the food\nnecessary to the sustenance of his family. The afternoon he devoted to\npainting, whilst the evening was given over to intercourse with his\nlittle circle of friends. The simplicity and tranquillity of his life\naroused the whole of his powers to action, and surrounded with\neverything he valued in life he was supremely happy.\n\nThe country around Barbizon appealed to him irresistibly. The\ntimber-studded plains, the gently undulating, highly cultivated\nfields, presented a strange contrast to the wild and rugged country\namidst which he had spent his childhood, and no doubt conduced to the\ndevelopment of a more refined and contemplative style than he would\notherwise have acquired. Upon his few visits to his native country he\nappears to have been more impressed than ever with its austerity, and\nthe drawings which these journeys called forth bore ample evidence of\nthis feeling in him.\n\nLack of the necessary funds to carry on even his simple m\u00e9nage was\never the bane of Millet's life. On many occasions Sensier, his\nintimate friend and afterwards his biographer, informs us he dissuaded\nhim from suicide.\n\nThe sums that he owed, small though they were, rendered him in\nconstant fear of the brokers. With creditors so importunate in their\ndemands for satisfaction, and with the constant lack of recognition,\nwhich was his lot, it is astonishing that Millet achieved so much. He\nwas relieved more than once by the kind-hearted and ever faithful\nRousseau, who when his friend was sorest pressed found some delicately\nhidden means to relieve him. It was he who acquired for 4000 francs\nthe wonderful \"Peasant grafting a Tree,\" when the picture failed to\nfind a purchaser; and in order that Millet should not be aware of his\ngenerosity, he made the offer in the name of an imaginary American.\n\nThis sort of goodness he repeated more than once, and it redounds\nstill more to his credit when we remember that Rousseau himself was\nnot infrequently in pecuniary difficulties.\n\nA constant succession of important works made their appearance during\nthe first ten years Millet spent at Barbizon. The first was the\nwell-known \"Sower,\" which has ever been one of the most popular of his\npictures. Then came the far finer \"Peasants going to Work,\" which for\nmany years was in an English Collection. The \"Gleaners,\" perhaps the\nnoblest canvas the master ever painted, dates from 1857, in which year\nit was seen at the Salon; the celebrated \"Angelus\" followed it two\nyears later. The prices which Millet obtained for this series of\nremarkable works was fantastically small. The \"Gleaners\" brought him a\npaltry 2000 francs, whilst he accounted himself lucky to encounter an\namateur who gave him the same sum for the small \"Woman feeding Fowls.\"\n\nThe \"Angelus,\" which was never exhibited, was sold in the year it was\npainted to a Monsieur Feydeau, an architect, for 1800 francs. It then\npassed through several hands before the late Monsieur Secr\u00e9tan\ncompeted up to 160,000 francs before he became possessed of the prize\nat the John Wilson sale.\n\nThe purchase, however, proved a sound investment, for upon the\ndispersal of his collection it was knocked down for 553,000 francs to\na Monsieur Proust, acting on behalf of the French Government. The\nlatter, however, when they gave the commission to buy the picture, had\nno idea that such a high value would be placed upon it, and\nconsequently refused to ratify the sale; a syndicate now came upon the\nscene, who took it to America. The price, however, proved greater than\neven the millionaires of the States were prepared to give, and the\ncanvas again returned to France, where it found a resting-place in the\ncollection of Monsieur Chauchard, who paid the enormous sum of 800,000\nfrancs for its possession.\n\nIn 1859 Millet sent two works to the Salon, a \"Woman grazing her Cow,\"\nand \"Death and the Woodman.\" The latter, one of the most\nphilosophical of Millet's pictures, which to-day is the principal\nattraction of the Jacobsen Museum at Copenhagen, was rejected.\n\nDisappointments of this kind came with such systematic regularity to\nthe painter that he must have become proof against them. He always had\nbitter enemies amongst the critics, who never failed to pour abuse\nupon his method and his subjects. Even a number of his fellow artists\njoined in the chorus of disapproval. But the vehemence with which he\nwas attacked was striking evidence of the impression he was making and\nthe inward sense of his own powers; and the fact that he was working\nout his destiny according to the dictates of his own genius supported\nhim against this outpouring of prejudice and malice. The social side\nof life appealed to him more strongly as the years rolled on, and the\nmurmurings which had been heard in 1859 as to the socialistic\ntendencies of \"Death and the Woodman\" swelled to a roar when the\nstupendous \"Man with the Hoe\" was exhibited fourteen years later. The\nlatter, one of the most virile studies of depraved humanity which the\nworld has ever seen, has always been a favourite with social\nreformers, and has inspired one remarkable poem. Even his most\nimplacable critics were disarmed before this canvas; its power was\nmagnetic; it was an inspiration, soul moving and trenchant.\n\nHis financial difficulties never completely dispersed. At one time, in\norder to insure himself a little tranquillity, he made a contract with\ntwo speculators, whereby they were to become possessors of all the\nwork he produced for three years, in consideration of their assuring\nhim a thousand francs a month. A great number of Millet's finest\nproductions passed thus through their hands, including the \"Return\nfrom the Fields\" and the \"Man with the Hoe.\" The partners were not\nlong in quarrelling, and after a lawsuit had been fought, Millet was\nleft in the hands of a man who frequently would not or could not pay\nhim in ready money, and whose bills he was frequently forced to\ndiscount at considerable loss.\n\nOne little gleam of sunshine rendered his later days happy. This was a\ncommission from a Colmar banker, Monsieur Thomas by name, who required\nfour allegorical compositions representing the Seasons, to decorate\nhis rooms. The artist was overjoyed by this piece of good fortune,\nand immediately commenced a most conscientious study of such mural\ndecoration as was within reach, in order that he might do full justice\nto his patron. He paid frequent visits to Fontainebleau and the\nLouvre, and even desired a friend to inquire if he could not obtain\nreproductions of the frescoes at Herculaneum and Pompeii. In spite of\nall this elaborate preparation, the subjects were not such as appealed\nto his genius, and in spite of them being well and soundly painted, we\nare told that they presented no features which called for special\ncomment.\n\nHe found, however, a much more genial occupation in accomplishing a\nseries of drawings ordered by a Monsieur Gavet, who paid the artist\n1000, 700, and 450 francs each, according to their size. He made\naltogether ninety-five drawings in this way, and it is said that this\ngentleman had in his possession the finest work in black and white and\nwater-colour the artist ever executed.\n\nTowards the latter end of his life the death of dear relatives and\nfriends cast a sorrowful gloom over him. Amongst the latter Rousseau,\nwho expired in his presence on the 22nd of December 1867, was\nperhaps the loss which seemed to him hardest to bear. A staunch and\ntrusty friend, who was to be relied upon when his prospects seemed the\nmost hopeless, he had been one of the very few who had appreciated\nMillet's talents at their full worth, and who, moreover, scanty as his\nown means were, was ever ready to stretch out his hand to assist his\nstruggling friend.\n\nShortly afterwards Millet paid a visit to his patron, Herr Hartmann,\nat M\u00fcnster, and from here he went for a short time into Switzerland.\n\nUpon his return he devoted himself with great earnestness to work, and\nachieved a certain success at the Salons with his exhibits. The\noutbreak of the war with Germany caused him to migrate with his family\nto Cherbourg, where he thought he might continue to work, removed as\nfar as possible from the scenes of carnage and struggle which were\ngoing on farther east. Transported once more amongst the scenes of his\nchildhood, he felt an increased impetus to production, and when he\nreturned to Barbizon late in 1871, he brought with him a number of\ncanvases of the highest quality; conspicuous amongst them was the\nwonderful \"Gr\u00e9ville Church,\" now in the Louvre.\n\nThe anxieties of his troublous life were, however, beginning to show\ntheir effect upon his constitution; a persistent cough developed, and\nalthough an amelioration would occasionally occur, it was always\nsucceeded by a worse condition than before. His health suffered a\ngeneral decline, and he finally breathed his last on the 20th of\nJanuary 1875. He was buried in the little cemetery of Chailly, beside\nhis friend Rousseau, amidst the scenery they both loved so well.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE MAN AND HIS ART\n\n\nMillet is an instance of an artist working out his own destiny,\nimpelled by irresistible genius, in the teeth of seemingly\ninsurmountable obstacles. He started life with enormous disadvantages;\nwithout friends in influential circles to spread his fame or plead his\ncause; without money to enable him to outlive and triumph over the\nignorant fanaticism of critics and artists, so soaked in the\nconventionalised art of their time that they had not perception enough\nto appreciate the full meaning of that naturalistic movement, which\nwas finally to sweep away the quasi-classic art they boasted of with\nsuch bombastic effusion. The path was hard and thorny, and his triumph\nwas not finally consummated until after his death. He himself found\nhis only satisfaction in the fact that he had lived his life according\nto the dictates of his genius, and had achieved the maximum of which\nhe was capable.\n\nMillet and our own Cotman were somewhat kindred spirits; there is much\nmore affinity between the work of the two men than is apparent to any\none who has not closely studied them. The marvellous \"Breaking the\nClod,\" now happily permanently housed at the British Museum, betrays\nthe same tremendous conception and broad outlook which characterises\nmany a drawing of Millet's. Both highly strung to a painful extent,\nthey were each conscious of their inability to curb the power which\nprescribed a certain course for them, and in spite of pecuniary\ndifficulties and unpopularity, an inevitable result of their intense\noriginality, they pursued a steady course to the end of their lives.\n\nThe socialistic doctrines which have been read into the work of Millet\nare rather the outcome of the world's uneasy conscience being brought\nface to face with a crushing indictment of existing conditions, than\nof any design on the artist's part to further the cause of a political\npropaganda by means of his art. This somewhat extravagant reading into\nhis art has certainly been carried to excess. Particularly has such\nbeen the case in America, where a large number of his finest works are\nat present to be found, curiously enough in the hands of enormously\nwealthy people, who are frequently perhaps the least able to\nunderstand the real meaning of his message.\n\nComing from a peasant stock, his sympathies were always with the\npeasant; it was the only class he understood or cared for. He lived as\none of them, and shared to a large extent in their labour. He has been\ndesignated, not inappropriately, the philosopher in sabots. Rightly or\nwrongly he has come to be looked upon as one of the high priests of\ncommunistic doctrines. Few pictures have been so anathematised as the\n\"Man with the Hoe,\" and perhaps none have done more to inculcate\nsympathy with the degradation of the lower orders of the human race.\n\nThe revolting brutality and vacancy of that face haunts the\nimagination. Is it possible that fellow-creatures so utterly debased\nby toil and neglect exist? Millet dispels any doubt upon the question\nby bequeathing to humanity this trenchant portrait. By no means\nlimited to Barbizon or France, these poor creatures exist in every\ncountry, and curiously enough are considered an essential element in\neach country's development.\n\nThis poignantly human note is observable in almost every work Millet\nwrought; his passionate sympathy with his fellow-man is the keynote of\nhis art. The wood-cutter in his arduous toil, the shepherd in his\nsolitariness, the labourer turning the soil with unvarying and\nlaborious monotony, the mother caring for her children--all carry the\nsame message for him of that strange and incomprehensible mingling of\njoy and sadness we call life. Like many great minds before and since\nhis time, our artist found the greatest joy in life in a placid and\nnever changing melancholy. But the peasants he chose knew nothing of\nthe sadness he saw in them. Completely inured to their toil, and\nsubdued by it, with no refining or uplifting influence to stimulate\nthem, they knew nothing, aspired to nothing beyond what they were; it\nwas left to Millet to supply the \"might have been.\" He saw the inky\nblackness of the mind of the \"Man with the Hoe,\" the pathetic\ninequality between the mounted farmer directing the safe storage of\nhis crop, and the stooping figures of the \"Gleaners\" eager to scrape\nup the miserable crumbs which had fallen from the rich man's table. He\ntraced the lives of these simple folk until we arrive at the grim and\ngaunt figure of Death, who, as he grasps the woodman by the shoulder,\nreminds him that his course is finished and that he, in common with\nall his fellow-men, must enter the great unknown land from which there\nis no return. It is a sad and melancholy art, vibrating with purity\nand truth, the outpouring of a great soul yearning to express itself\nto the utmost of its power. The mind and character of the man can be\nread in every line and in every touch of the brush. His drawings and\netchings are even more searching in their virility than his pictures.\n\nThere is a spontaneousness about them we search for in vain in his\nwork in oil and pastel. In black and white his intensely emotional\nmind found a swift method of expression; in the laboriousness of oil\npainting he was fettered with the complications of the medium. It can\nbe fairly said that only in one or two paintings--a notable example\ncan be cited in the wondrous \"Sawyers\" at South Kensington--does he\nrise to the height of a great painter. Millet was a poet, a\nphilosopher, a great thinker, and the means he chose for expressing\nhimself were those which were best fitted to his purpose. His\npredilections in art were concentrated upon the greatest, and\nconsequently the men who appealed to him were the thinkers of the\nages. Mantegna and Correggio, Michel Angelo and the mighty Greeks,\nthese were the masters who left their impress upon his mind and art.\n\nThe influence of so sincere and profound an artist has necessarily\nbeen profound. He has moulded men who have achieved world-wide fame;\nSegantini, for example, would never have risen to the heights he did\nhad the example of Millet not been ever before him. There have been\nmany who, without possessing his genius, have endeavoured to follow\nin his footsteps, but successfully as his imitators have sometimes\ncaught his style, their productions can never live alongside his,\nbecause they lack the real ring of sincerity.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n        a. One bed, or folding cot,\n        b. One oil stove,\n        c. One lamp,\n        d. Enough supplies of all kinds sufficient for six months,\n        e. Pots, pans, kettles, etc.\nIt is needless to say that positions in Manila and Iloilo were now at\na premium.\n\nWas it possible that teachers were to be sent to places where even the\nnecessaries of life could not be obtained! Was it possible that many\nwould be sent to places so remote that for six months no fresh\nsupplies could be gotten! A mass meeting was held at once, and a\ncommittee was appointed to send a cablegram to the Associated Press\npetitioning aid from the American people at large. Realizing what\nconsternation would be created throughout the United States by such a\nmessage, two of the teachers leaped into a carriage at the close of\nthe meeting and a few moments later were closeted with the chief\nexecutive of the department. As a result the committee was persuaded\nnot to send the cablegram to the Associated Press until by courtesy it\nhad been sent to the President. Of course, this diplomatic move tided\naffairs over and the teachers who had flatly refused to budge from\nManila now agreed to go on to their stations, being assured that\nwhatever action was best would be taken.\n\nThe day had come when we must separate. We were to enter an untried\nand an unknown field. It was fitting that we have a final joyous\nmeeting, so the best orchestra in the archipelago was engaged and we\n\"chased the hours with flying feet\" until dawn so that whatever might\ncome to us in that unknown future upon which we were entering each\nwould hold in pleasant memory our last evening together.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER III. - A DRAMA IN ACTUAL LIFE.\n\n\nAlmost every one heeded the warning to go to his station forearmed\nwith at least necessaries of life, but, as it had never fallen to the\nlot of the writer to cook, he refused to learn at that late day, so he\ntook no pot, no pan, no kettle, putting his future into the hands of\nan uncertain fate and relying upon the unknown hospitality of the\nFilipino.\n\nBacalod, the capital of the province of Occidental Negros, was our\ndestination. The second morning after leaving Manila, we awoke with\nthe \"Kilpatrick\" lying at anchor in a shallow bay. We were several\nmiles from the shore and nothing in sight indicated that we had\nreached a place of any importance. Late the night before we had been\nawakened by the loud, sharp ringing of the ship's bells, accompanied\nby the reversal of the engines and a general disturbance awaking the\ncrew. So our first impressions on coming on deck were that we had run\naground. But the captain assured us that everything was ship-shape and\nthat this was the nearest point of approach to Capiz, a town of\nconsiderable importance on the island of Panay, where a body of troops\nwas to embark for home. Not even the grass hut of a native was in\nsight. Search as we would, not a sign was seen of a stream flowing\ninto the sea, indicating the probable presence of a town. There was\nnot a sign of life of any kind save one lone column of thin, blue\nsmoke that arose from the side of a mountain miles away. One would\nhave thought that we were explorers of three hundred years ago lying\noff the shore of some unknown land.\n\nAfter breakfast the steam launch, together with all the boats, was\nlowered, and several of us who had determined to miss no opportunity\nto gather information about the islands took our places in the launch\nby the side of the ship's mate, and steamed away across the water with\na long line of boats strung out in the rear. We headed away toward a\ngroup of cocoanut trees, and about an hour later stepped ashore on a\npile of decayed coral rocks that extended some twenty or thirty feet\nout into the water, thus forming the only landing place of a town of\nseveral thousands of people and of considerable commercial importance.\n\nA few moments after we had landed, an army wagon drawn by a\nmagnificent pair of mules came up out of a tropical jungle along a\nnarrow road. We clambered into the wagon and were soon lost in the\ndepths of foliage from which we had just seen the vehicle emerge.\n\nLong waving bamboos with their plumy leafage hung over the road from\neach side, meeting and overlapping in the center until they formed an\narchway so dense that the tropical sun now high in the heavens\npenetrated it only at intervals. At times the wagon sank up to the\nhubs in the soft earth, and the muscles of the mules stood out like\nwhip-cords under the skin as they drew us forward.\n\nAt a sharp turn in the road we came upon the first division of troops\nthat was to embark for home. The look of joy upon their sun-browned\nfaces was inexpressible. Their work was done, and with elastic step\nand smiling faces they saluted us as they passed by. The reign of\nforce was at an end; it was going out with them; the reign of peace\nhad begun; it was coming in with us.\n\nIn the afternoon when we returned from the town the last of the troops\nhad arrived and, as we drove up, the bugle was sounding the call to\nsupper. We noticed native women mingling with the troops and, indeed,\na native woman was in constant attention waiting upon one of the\nsoldiers with whom we ate. Her clothes were clean, her hair was nicely\ncombed, and her general appearance was neat. She seemed to anticipate\nthe slightest wish of the soldier with whom she was. She brought him\nwater to drink, cleaned his plate after the meal and saw that his\nknife, fork, and spoon were put into his haversack.\n\nWe had now finished supper and the launch had returned for the last\nload of troops. The lieutenant in command of the company gave the\norder to \"fall in\"; the men shouldered their rifles and fell into\nline. \"Forward, march!\" called the lieutenant, and the column swept\nforward towards the boats. The women had until now restrained\nthemselves, but, as their husbands marched away never to return, their\nfeelings could no longer be restrained. One young woman of about\neighteen, who was leaning against a rock by the roadside sobbing, when\nher husband passed, leaped up in frenzy of passionate love and caught\nthe rifle from his shoulder. Her first impulse seemed to be to throw\nthe gun away, but suddenly realizing the futility of such an act she\nburst into tears, shouldered the rifle herself and marched on by his\nside. Another woman of more mature age threw her arms around the legs\nof a tall stalwart man, and drew him bodily from the line.\n\nBut the troops marched on and entered the boats. One woman who had\nbeen unnoticed before came down into the shallow water and caught hold\nof our last boat as if to prevent its leaving, while others stood\nmingling their sobs with the sounds of the wavelets as they broke on\nthe sands. As we passed away, an expectant mother, standing in bold\noutline against the twilight sky, threw up her hands in an agony of\ndespair and then sank upon the stones. The curtain had fallen upon a\ndrama in actual life deeper in pathos than any other we had ever seen\nor ever expected to see. Depth of passion, depth of love! Who can\nfathom the human heart?\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. - WHAT THE TEACHERS DID.\n\n\nThere is a remarkable sameness about the towns in the Philippines.\n\nThey all have a large open square about the middle of the town, around\nthree sides of which are Chinese stores, unless one side lies open to\nthe sea, and on the fourth is the great stone ecclesia. The streets\nrun at right angles to one another and divide up the town into\ncreditable squares.\n\nEverybody in the Philippines lives up-stairs, for the ground is so\nsoaked with water during the rainy season that it is a menace to\nhealth to live upon the ground floor. So even the poorest nippa hut\nis built upon stakes four or five feet above the ground.\n\nBacalod is a typical Philippine town. As we landed, a broad open\nsquare was spread out before us. Two sides of the square were lined\nwith two-story houses in which were Chinese stores below and Filipino\nhomes above. On the third side stood the great stone church in whose\nmassive tower the clock was striking the hour of four, while the\nfourth lay open to the sea that had borne us thither.\n\nWe landed, but it was in a method new to us and one not usually\nemployed by the traveling public.\n\nWhen our sail boat ran aground on the sandy bottom a hundred yards or\nmore from the shore, a crowd of Filipino men who were on the beach\nslowly rolled up their pantaloons and waded out to the rescue,--for\nthe money that was in it. The boat's crew elevated their trousers'\nlegs also and slided down into the water. Each of us then straddled\nthe neck of a Filipino standing in the water and was held by ankles to\nbe steadied while our biped mounts proceeded to the shore.\n\nWe were now on the ground and face to face with the situation. To give\nthe reader an idea of the actual conditions met by the first teachers\nwho went to the Islands, the following is copied from the instructions\ngiven us in Manila:\n    1. There shall be two sessions daily of all schools, and the\n    last hour of the morning session shall be devoted solely to\n    instructing the Filipino teachers.\n\n    2. In cases where teachers are sent to a town in which there\n    is no school-house, they are expected to secure the aid of the\n    people and have one built.\n\n    3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is\n    stopped.\n\n    4. All supplies must be kept under lock and key. In towns\n    where there is no case or box to lock the supplies in, and it\n    is also impossible to get the town council to furnish a case,\n    a requisition may be sent to Manila, and, if an appropriation\n    can be secured, one will be made and sent out.\n\nThus it can be easily seen that we were indeed pioneers. In many\nplaces no school-house was to be found, and in some cases it was even\ndifficult to get the town council to provide a case in which to keep\nthe supplies.\n\nThe work of the teachers was, in short; to \"make the English language\nthe basis of instruction in the public schools.\" On our arrival at\nBacalod two schools were found in progress, for some soldiers had been\ndetailed for the work here previous to our coming. One of these was\nfor boys and the other, for girls. Thus the work here had been in a\nmeasure simplified, but complications that had arisen at Talisay, one\nof the largest and richest towns on the island, demanded a change of\nteachers and the writer was assigned to the place as superintendent.\n\nHere an attempt had been made to start a school but it had failed\nignominiously and a system of education was to be put into operation\nfrom the very start.\n\nThe Filipinos are not strong advocates of co-education, so separate\nschools were to be started for the boys and the girls. The one for the\nboys was gotten well in hand before the one for the girls was\nattempted at all.\n\nA few days after reaching the town and securing a home the\npresidente of the town had it publicly announced that the following\nMonday morning at eight o'clock a public school for boys would be\nopened in a building that had been rented for the purpose by the\nmunicipal council. About the middle of the afternoon of the same day a\nman beat a little drum throughout all the streets of the town to call\nthe people out and the town clerk announced both in Spanish and in the\nnative language that this public school would begin at the time and\nplace mentioned above; that instruction would be free to all who came;\nthat the government would furnish all supplies; and that instruction\nwould be given in the English language. A native principal and\nassistants were employed and everything was ready to begin.\n\nThe official report of the result is as follows:\n    Boys' public school of Talisay, Negros, P. I., began November\n    4, 1901. Forty-three boys present at eight o'clock. Forty-one\n    of them knew \"good morning\" and \"good afternoon\" but do not\n    know the distinction between them. Two of them speak simple\n    Spanish. At eight forty-five, eight more, who had been\n    attending an early morning private school, came in together.\n\n    The books they brought were so varied and so different from\n    one another that it seemed impossible to bring any reasonable\n    degree of order out of such a chaos, and so, after struggling\n    vainly for about a week with the problem, the superintendent\n    by one fell stroke removed everything in use and put in a\n    uniform system, and from that day on the English language has\n    been the basis of instruction in the public schools of\n    Talisay. The work was of necessity very slow at first, but by\n    the end of a year two schools were going nicely and a number\n    of the brightest boys and girls had made really excellent\n    progress.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER V. - A \"BAILE.\"\n\n\nNot long after the arrival of our party at Bacalod we received an\ninvitation to a \"baile\" given in our honor by the inhabitants of\nSilay, a town some ten or twelve miles up the northern coast and one\nnoted for its social life. The invitation was accepted with pleasure,\nand about the middle of the afternoon on the day appointed we were\nclad in the immaculate white of the tropics and steaming away up the\ncoast on board a launch sent for our conveyance. Twilight was still\nlingering on the path of day when we anchored just off shore at the\ntown. A row-boat containing the officials of the city came out to meet\nus and, in due season, we were ushered into a spacious drawing-room\nfilled almost to overflowing with the \u00e9lite of the town. The \u00e9lite of\ntowns in the Philippines speak Spanish, and, as only one or two of our\nparty could at that time boast of more than a formal acquaintance with\nthe Castilian tongue, the exchange of ideas that evening between us\nand the Filipinos was of necessity not very rapid.\n\nThe necessity of easy communication between us was rendered somewhat\nless indispensable by the announcement of supper as soon as we were\nrested from our trip. When we had taken our places at the table a\nyoung Filipino about twenty-five years of age arose and gave a lengthy\ntoast to the recent union of the Philippines with the United States.\n\nBut as we Americans were unable to scale the dizzy heights of his\nclimaxes or sink to the depths of his pathos, we forewent the\npleasures of his oratory and turned our attention to the savory odor\nof lamb, chicken, and roast pig that came slyly stealing up our\nnostrils to send us nerve dispatches about the gastronomic delights of\nour not far distant future.\n\nAt last the toast was ended and the world-wide soup ushered in a long\ntrain of things good to eat, served in a style better fitted to the\ndelights of the appetite than to the formalities of dinners, for, as\nsoon as the pleasant task of one dish was completed by any one, the\nnext was served him at once regardless of the progress made by the\nothers at the table.\n\nThe last course was dulce. The new-comers to the Philippines will\nnot be long in making the acquaintance of this dish, and at all\nmeetings, both public and private, where eatables are served, it\nperforms an important part. It is anything sweet, and it may vary all\nthe way from an india-rubber-like black mixture of cocoanut milk and\ndirty sugar to a really toothsome and respectable confection. No\nmatter of what materials a dish is composed, just so long as it is\nsweet, it is dulce.\n\nAfter paying our respects to this last course, we arose from the table\nand entered a great rectangular room from the center of whose ceiling\nhung a large glass chandelier, a mass of shimmering crystals. In the\nchairs around the room were the wealth, the youth, and the beauty of\nthe town.\n\nThe first and also the last number of every Filipino dance of any\nformality is the \"rigodon.\" The dancers are arranged in a square, or\nquadrangle according to the number participating, and are then led\nthrough a tangled maze of figures that so utterly bewilders the novice\nthat he sinks into his chair at the end of the dance wondering how it\nall came to pass.\n\nWe Americans breathed a sigh of relief when the \"rigodon\" ended, and\nmustered fresh courage for social conquests in the waltz that was now\nbreathing forth from the trembling strings. My companion in the first\ndance had been the young lady by whose side I had sat at dinner. But\nit now became necessary to search for another, so I prudently waited\nto see how partners were chosen, and made no mistake when a few\nmoments later I faced one of the most luscious looking se\u00f1oritas on\nthe opposite side of the room and offered her my arm. My eyes must\nhave told the story that my lips could not utter in Spanish, for she\nsmiled upon me sweetly, arose, and put her hand upon my shoulder. My\narm encircled her waist and I began to waltz. Unfortunately my\ncompanion did not follow, but began to hop up and down in a manner\nmost distressing. Supposing the attack to be only temporary, I paused\nand, much to my relief, she soon showed signs of recovery; and in the\ncourse of time she came to a standstill looking up into my face in an\ninquiring sort of way, apparently wondering why St. Vitus had not paid\nhis respects to me also. A second attempt to follow the music met with\nresults similar to the first, and during the third attempt, which\nseemed to be trembling on the verge of a failure, St. Vitus let go my\ncompanion and seized me with such vigor that she, who was small even\nfor a Filipino, was gathered up bodily and taken around the room at\nsuch a pace that her toes touched the floor only at far distant\nintervals.\n\nAt this point my devotion to the shrine of Terpsichore ceased from\nforce of circumstances and I seated myself in one of the most\ncomfortable chairs in sight that I might carry out a previously formed\nplan to study the Filipino somewhat critically as he appears in\nsociety.\n\nThe first thing that impressed me as the dancers passed up and down\nthe room was the flash of diamonds. Nearly every woman in the room had\non a brooch that flashed the colors of the rainbow at every turn.\n\nAlmost all of them wore one or more rings that showed up brilliantly\nunder the chandelier. Many of the men too, especially the young men,\nwore gems that appeared to be exquisite. A closer inspection showed\nthat some of the gems had flaws and others were of a poor color, but\nno one would have denied that, taken as a whole, it was a really\nbeautiful display.\n\nThe dress of the ladies was richly colored. Many of their skirts were\nof silk covered with hand embroidered flowers, and their filmy pina\nwaists and broad collar pieces were rich with needle-work. They all\nwore a kind of heelless velvet slipper, very common as a dress shoe in\nthe Philippines, or high-heeled patent leather shoes with neatly\nfitting black stockings.\n\nThe men were dressed in white coats and white pantaloons or black\ncoats and white pantaloons. White shirts and collars, together with\nall sorts and styles of cravats and low-cut patent leather shoes with\nhighly colored socks completed their dress.\n\nIt was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money;\nthat they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a\ntable loaded with good things was a fact to which all of us were\nenthusiastic witnesses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VI. - A SKETCH OF LIFE IN THE PHILIPPINES.\n\n\nHouse-keeping in the Philippines presents some interesting phases. Our\nclub of American officials decided to run a mess, so we employed a\ncook and a house boy, then each of us provided himself with a personal\nservant, making a total of six servants for four men--it takes about\nthis proportion of servants to live in any sort of comfort in the\nPhilippines--and launched ourselves boldly upon the sea of domestic\neconomy. But there were shoals ahead of us, for the question of\nregulating servants is one of no small importance in the Philippines,\nand one of its most disadvantageous features is the long chain of\ndependents that usually attends it.\n\nWe gave the cooks so much a day with which to buy supplies in the\nlocal market, for our own table, making him render a daily list of\nexpenditures, and a fixed amount besides to purchase rice and fish for\nhimself and the other servants. Of course, if they wished to vary\ntheir diet and get chicken and fresh pork, which could be had at far\ndistant intervals, it was wholly a matter of their option, but the\nallowance was made on the basis of so much rice and fish a day for\neach. This allowance was about fifteen cents a day in Spanish coin per\nservant.\n\nThus far all was well. We had agreed to give the cook eight dollars a\nmonth in Spanish money, thinking that good wages would procure good\nservice, but the visions of affluence that floated before him on such\nfloods of wealth were so alluring that they drew him from the kitchen\nto the cooler veranda. In less than a week he had employed an\nassistant at four dollars a month; in less than another week that\nassistant had employed him an assistant at two dollars a month; in\nless than another week that assistant to the assistant had employed\nhim an assistant at the princely salary of fifty cents a month; and\nfrom fear that the chain of dependents would end only by our having\nthe whole Filipino race attached to our culinary force, we broke up\nhouse-keeping and went boarding again, choosing that as the less of\nthe two evils.\n\nOur house furnishings were almost wholly Philippine. The table ware\nand the food on the table came from the ends of the earth. The knives\nand forks were made in Germany, the plates were manufactured in\nEngland, the glass ware and table cloth, in the United States. The\noatmeal and flour came from the United States also. The butter came\nfrom Australia, the rice from China, the salt from Russia, and the\nother eatables from sources about as various as their separate names.\n\nSwitzerland furnished the condensed milk and Illinois the canned\ncream. Nearly all of the canned fruit bore labels from Spain.\n\nThus it can easily be seen that life in the Philippines, if lived\naccording to American ideals, is dependent upon a highly developed and\nhighly complex commerce. However, the difficulties of transportation\nand the restriction of large stocks of merchandise to Manila and some\nhalf a dozen other towns, make so great a difference between country\nlife and city life that a short comparison of the two will not be out\nof place, and life in Manila may well be taken as being fairly typical\nof the latter.\n\nLife in Manila is pleasant, but expensive. It is pleasant from the\nfact that it is not only the capital but also metropolis of the\narchipelago. Thus the combination of wealth and high official position\nhas given to Manila a society of the highest and most refined type.\n\nThe process of beautifying and improving the city which is constantly\ngoing on bids fair to give us at no distant day a city of which we may\nwell be proud.\n\nBut let him who intends living well in Manila on a small income bid\nfarewell at once to so idylic a dream, for it costs much to live well\nthere. In the city of Manila one can get almost anything he wishes,\nbut it must be paid for at the price it commands. Especially in the\ncase of eatables, this price is by no means small, because to the\nfirst cost of articles must in most cases be added the expense of\ndistant shipment from American, European, or Australian ports, and not\ninfrequently the cost of long refrigeration must also be taken into\nconsideration. But, expensive though it is, it is very pleasant to\nlive there and those who have once enjoyed it often wish again to\nquaff the cup of its delights.\n\nIn strong contrast to this pleasant life is the life of the quiet\nlittle hamlet away in the distant islands. Indeed, the Filipino from\nthe distant town, who by some good fortune has been to Manila, or, by\na coup de main, has studied in one of the Manila colleges, is looked\nup to in a true hero-worshiping attitude by all who either know him or\nhear of his fame. Life in such a place is one long state of harmless\ninactivity. Not a wave of trouble from the great outer world ever\ndisturbs its peaceful repose. One lounges forever in an air of\nindolent ease and extreme aversion to anything approaching what might\nbe called a respectable effort.\n\nOne arises in the morning about the time the sun's first rays silver\nthe top leaves of the cocoanut trees and then stirs around until nine\nor ten o'clock, when it is found expedient to avoid a further exposure\nto the sun. From then until about five o'clock in the afternoon it is\nbest to take things as they come, even though one of those things be a\nFilipino dinner. But then you may have your vehiclo attached to a\nyoung bull with a ring in his nose and go for a drive. If it is the\ndry season you will probably enjoy the drive unless you object to the\nfrequent clouds of dust swept along by the evening wind. If it is in\nthe rainy season your pleasure will depend to a considerable extent\nupon how wet you get; but, whether the season be wet or dry, your\npleasure will be regulated largely by the state of harmony existing\nbetween the driver and the bull.\n\nIn these quiet secluded nooks successive generations of Filipinos are\nborn, reared, grow old and die in an even chain of events broken only\nby the occasional erection of a new grass house on the identical spot\nwhere its predecessors have stood for ages. The son lives in the house\nof his father, cultivates the same few square feet of soil planted in\nedible roots, climbs the same cocoanut trees, follows the same winding\npath down to the stream, pounds rice in the same mortar and with the\nsame stick that his ancestors have used from time unremembered, and,\nin case of illness, curls up on a grass mat in a corner of the room\nuntil he dies or by some good fortune recovers. Beyond this narrow\nhorizon he never looks. So narrow and contracted is the life that the\nlanguages of two towns a few miles apart are so different that one\nwould scarcely recognize them as belonging to the same race of people.\n\nSuch are the two extremes of life in our new far Eastern provinces:\nthe one is active, progressive, and cosmopolitan; the other, inactive,\ndecadent, and narrow; but, whether one enjoys the first or endures the\nsecond, there comes to him after leaving a longing to lounge again in\ntropic airs and listen to the lullaby of the winds among the palms.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VII. - THE FILIPINO AT HOME.\n\n\nAs one enters a Filipino sitting-room for the first time, there is one\nfeature in the arrangement of the furniture that impresses itself upon\nhim at once, and it may be stated without fear of serious\ncontradiction that this same peculiar feature in its arrangement will\ncontinue to face him, as he enters different homes, about as certainly\nas he crosses the threshold.\n\nThe arrangement referred to is that of one large mirror, one settee,\nand some ten or a dozen chairs that appear to have had a certain\norderly affection for one another. The mirror is hung upon one of the\nlarge interior parts of the house about four feet above the floor. The\nwooden houses in the Philippines are built by setting large posts\nupright into the ground, extending into the air from twenty to thirty\nfeet. Cross timbers are fastened to these upright posts about eight or\nten feet above the ground and then not sawed off even with the posts,\nbut allowed to extend beyond them each way. The framework of the house\nis built upon these extending cross timbers, a style of building by\nwhich these large upright posts are left standing out on the inside of\nthe room from one to three feet from the walls. It is on that one of\nthese posts most nearly opposite the door that the mirror always finds\nits place. Immediately beneath the mirror is the settee; and the\nchairs are arranged in two parallel lines facing one another and at\nright angles with the ends of the settee. However odd this arrangement\nmay appear to one when he first enters a Filipino drawing-room, there\nare two things to be said in its favor. In the first place, it places\nyou face to face with the person with whom you are conversing so that\nyou can watch him,--a matter of no small moment in the Philippines. In\nthe next place, it enables you to give one of the young ladies a\nsheep's-eye in the mirror while the others present are left where\nMoses was in our much abused conundrum.\n\nThe size of the residence and the quality of its furnishings depends\nupon the wealth of the owner. But there is so vast a difference\nbetween the mode of life of the highest class and the tao, or lowest\nclass, that it is well to speak of them separately, and the great\nmiddle class of Filipinos can easily be imagined to occupy the\nintervening ground.\n\nThe rich Filipino's house is usually of wood built upon a wall of\nstone or brick from ten to fifteen feet high. The floors are kept\nhighly polished in his hallway, dressing-room, and bed-rooms. There\nare, of course, no fire-places in any of the rooms, but on some\noccasions something is needed to dry the rain-soaked atmosphere, for\neven in the dry season it has been seen to rain for five successive\ndays and nights without the cessation of a moment.\n\nA long chain of dependents is attached to the household of the rich\nFilipino. The master has his special body servant to be present at all\ntimes to do his master's bidding, in short, to be the visible\nmechanism of his master's volition. So, too, the lady of the house has\nher servant woman to do the slightest bidding of her ladyship. Then\nthere is the cook who is almost invariably a man, a house boy or two,\nand the coachman. These functionaries, with their assistants and\nassistants to the assistants, together with a servant or two for the\nexclusive service of the children, complete the economic household.\n\nSuch a family has an abundance of rice and wheat bread, also of\nchicken and fish with occasional fresh beef. They have also a good\ndeal of dulce. They regularly serve wine and frequently serve beer\non their tables.\n\nIn strong contrast with this mode of life is that of the tao. His\ndiet consists almost wholly of rice and small uncleaned fish boiled\ntogether. As a rule knife, fork, plate, and spoon find no place in his\nhousehold. The rice and fish are boiled in a pot and then allowed to\ncool in the same vessel or poured out to cool in a large earthen or\nwooden bowl. Then Mr. Tao together with Mrs. Tao and all the young\nTaos squat on their heels around the mixture and satisfy that\nintangible thing called the appetite. They do not use chop sticks as\nthe Chinese do, but the rice and fish are caught in a hollow formed by\nthe first three fingers of the right hand. The thumb is then placed\nbehind the mass. It is raised up and poised before the mouth, with a\nskill coming from the evolution of ages, when a contraction of the\nmuscles of the thumb throws the mass into the mouth with a skill that\nis marvelous to any but a Filipino. To judge from the most reliable\ninformation, the poorest class do not have an abundance of food,\nalthough it would seem that such a condition of things would be\nwell-nigh impossible. However, in a census of one hundred school\nchildren there were found six boys and four girls who declared that\nthey had never had enough to eat, and the native teacher stated that\nthis was probably true.\n\nThe wide gulf between the tao and the rich man is filled by the\ngreat middle class of Filipinos.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VIII. - VISIT TO A LEPER COLONY.\n\n\nNot far from our town was a leper colony and the first Saturday that\ncould be spared was set aside for a trip to the place. It happened\nthat none of the other Americans were at leisure on this particular\nmorning, but, rather then delay the trip or miss it altogether, the\nwriter, armed with a revolver, started out alone.\n\nThe road had been described so accurately by one who was supposed to\nknow it that it was deemed well-nigh impossible to miss the way. The\nmain highway was followed to the point where the by-path supposed to\nlead to the settlement turned off through some bamboo thickets and a\nlow tropical wood. This path led straight away towards the sea-coast\nwhere the houses of the colony were said to stand in a cocoanut grove\nby the beach.\n\nUpon arriving at the settlement, a very inhospitable reception was\nreceived from a mangy cur that growled and showed a very uninviting\nset of sharp, white teeth behind his snarling lips. The growling of\nthe dog had attracted the attention of an old man who, with age-bent\nback, was pounding rice in a mortar about fifty yards away. He turned\nslowly around and, upon seeing an intruder into the primitive quiet of\nthe place, gave a sharp, far-reaching call. The sound had scarcely\nrung through the grove when from about a dozen of the little grass\nhouses dotted here and there fifteen or twenty men armed with bolos\ncame out and gathered around the old man. A sense of my danger flashed\nupon me. Three miles from town and alone in a tropical jungle, I could\nbe almost instantly overcome by this band of bolo-men, and the only\nreport that would ever reach my people would be that I had\n\"disappeared.\" Of course, attack was by no means certain, but the\npotentiality of the situation was thrilling. A drawn revolver and the\ngleaming of its shining barrel had the effect of stopping the men, who\nseemed to be hesitating as to a course of action, until a somewhat\ndignified retreat was made to an open space in the rear from where a\nless dignified and a more hasty retreat began which did not stop short\nof Bacalod.\n\nEnough had been seen, however, even in this short visit, to give\nconvincing proof that the settlement visited was no colony of lepers;\nso, that afternoon two servant boys being taken as guides and\ninterpreters, another attempt was made to reach the goal desired.\n\nThis attempt was successful, and, after about two hours of walking, a\nlittle cluster of grass huts snugly hidden by the sea-coast came into\nview. As we approached, one would have thought it a gala-day. Some few\nchildren, apparently from six to thirteen years of age, almost wholly\nnude, were romping and playing in the open space around which the huts\nstood, and no one would ever have thought that any cloud so horrible\nas leprosy could hover over a place apparently so happy.\n\nBy the side of the path as we passed was a man and his wife setting\nout potato plants. His hands were so puffed and his fingers so short\nthat he could scarcely use them, but he was working along as best he\ncould. His wife's feet were so swollen and twisted that she walked\nonly with the greatest difficulty. We passed them by and entered the\nopen space above referred to.\n\nThe children now saw us, and those of them who could darted away like\nfrightened rabbits, each to his own burrow. An old man who was sitting\nin the warm afternoon sun on the little bamboo platform before his hut\nwas aroused from his lethargic repose by the scampering away of the\nchildren. He arose, trembling upon his tottering limbs, all drawn and\ntwisted, and hobbled away into his hut.\n\nThe children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at\nthe doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of\nthe settlement. In a few moments we were surrounded by a circle of\nhuman beings at once so repulsive and so pitiable that its graphic\nvividness can never be accurately portrayed.\n\nThe old man referred to above, having put on a pair of snow-white\npantaloons, appeared now at the doorway of his hut, followed a few\nmoments later by his wife who had evidently clothed herself in the\nbest raiment she had. At a call from the old man, all the men, women,\nand children in the settlement came out of their huts and stood in a\nline before us. The old man was spokesman and in his native visayan\ntongue made a heart-rending appeal for aid which we were powerless to\ngive. Attention was called to a leper woman, apparently about\ntwenty-five years of age, whose face had been attacked by the disease\nand whose appearance was truly pathetic. Upon her hip was a child\nabout a year and a half old and, strange to say, the child showed as\nyet no signs whatever of the disease.\n\nWhat an indissoluble enigma is life! Here in a little cluster of grass\nhuts in a secluded nook of a secluded island of an all but secluded\narchipelago was gathered together a little community of wretched\nnatives, driven by their loathsomeness from association with others\neven of the same half-savage race. Yet here, men and women loved and\nwere married, by mutual trust if not by law, and children were born of\nthe union to live forever under the unspeakable horror that\novershadowed the unfortunate parents. Love, hatred, sorrow, and\njoy--every passion that enters into the complex structure of the human\nheart even here, in this scene of sadness and despair, was playing\napparently as freely as where misfortune and disease had never crossed\nthe portals of life.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER IX. - A \"HIKE.\"\n\n\nWe were lounging lazily in our hammocks at Jimamaylan one evening in\nApril. Supper was just ended, and the soldiers in the post were\ncollected in groups here and there spinning yarns to pass away the\ntime, when a Filipino clad only in a loin cloth came down the street\nat a steadily swinging run and stopped in front of the sentry. He\nbrought the announcement that a band of ladrones had just burned a\nsugar mill and were advancing to sack a barrio about fifteen miles\naway.\n\nThe invitation of the commanding officer to go on a \"hike\" was eagerly\naccepted, and, in ten minutes after the message was given, the troops\nwere on the march followed by two adventurous pedagogues.\n\nDarkness was just closing in as we left the town, but a resplendent\ntropic moon soon made the night almost as brilliant as the day. The\ntrail we followed led over rough and rocky country. Sometimes for a\ndistance of a mile or more we passed over barren wastes of volcanic\nslag poured out in anger by some peak whose convulsions have long\nsince ceased. Again we would descend into a tropical jungle from the\ndense foliage of which the ladrones could have leaped at any moment,\nhad they known of our coming, and annihilated our little band. We\nforded rapid streams with the water at our breasts, and halted only\nonce in that rapid march of fifteen miles.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the town we met a man who was standing\nguard against a surprise by the ladrones. Nothing could well have been\nmuch more grotesque and nothing could much better illustrate the\nabsolutely primitive condition of the Filipinos in the interior of the\nislands than the appearance of this guard. A pair of knee pants, a\nconical grass hat, and a hemp shirt formed his entire apparel. A long\nflat wooden shield, a bolo, and a long bamboo spear with a sharp,\nflat, iron point, completed his equipment for battle.\n\nHere stood the first and the twentieth centuries side by side. The\nFilipino who had advanced only a stage beyond the condition of\nprimitive man with his knife, spear, and wooden shield, stood side by\nside with the American soldier, a representative of modern life with\nhis magazine rifle, his canteen, his knapsack,--with every article of\nhis clothing made to give him the highest possible efficiency as the\nunit of a military organization.\n\nA few yards farther on we met another guard equipped similarly to the\nfirst. Upon reaching the town, news had just been received that a\ndetachment of troops from another post had intercepted the ladrones\nand fought a skirmish with them. The ladrones had escaped and we set\nout in pursuit of them on a chase wilder than a Quixotic dream. We\nwound our way into the mountains behind the town, inquiring at every\ngrass hut we passed whether the band of ladrones had passed that way,\nbut only once was even a trace of them found. Then it was learned that\nat a certain place they had separated into groups of three or four and\ngone glimmering through the dream of things that were. This place was\nin a secluded nook of the mountains where in years gone by some\nadventurous Spaniard had erected a primitive water mill to grind his\nsugar-cane. We had now marched about twenty miles and the feet of the\npedagogues were a mass of blisters. They had reached the point where\nthat form of military maneuvering called \"hiking\" ceased to possess\nany alluring charms. So a native was persuaded to come out of his lone\nmountain hut and hitch up his carabao and cart. He was then made to\nget on the carabao's back, while the aforesaid pedagogues lay down on\nthe sugar-cane pulp that had been put into the body of the cart, and\nthe driver was instructed to start for the post we had left hours\nbefore, and not to stop until he got there. Being uncertain but that\nsome of the ladrones would learn of our having left the body of troops\nand would try the metal of our steel, we at first agreed that neither\nof us should go to sleep, but it was later decided that probably the\ndriver had no greater desire to cross the Styx than his passengers had\nand that in case of danger he would awaken us, so both took a revolver\nin each hand, stretched out supinely and went to sleep.\n\nSuch a sleep! The rough jolting of the cart over an almost impassable\nroad was never enough to break the spell of slumber. When we awoke the\nblazing tropic sun was past the midday mark of morning, shining full\ninto our unprotected and well-nigh blistered faces.\n\nA pack of dogs were heralding our approach to a little village at the\nfoot of the mountains where ponies were procured to take us back to\nthe post."

                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently\nno time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth dimension of Space\nas a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house\nbecame quite quiet.\n\nOn reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up\nagainst a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realize\nhis position. Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\nhundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the\nDowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone\ninto hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains on\none of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who\nhad been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr\nto nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair\nby the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six\nweeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become\nreconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that\nnotorious sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible\nnight when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his\ndressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and\nconfessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox\nout of \u00a350,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card, and swore that\nthe ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back\nto him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because\nhe had seen a green hand tapping at the window-pane, to the beautiful\nLady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round\nher throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin,\nand who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of the\nKing's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he went\nover his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as\nhe recalled to mind his last appearance as \"Red Reuben, or the Strangled\nBabe,\" his d\u00e9but as \"Guant Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,\"\n\nand the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely\nplaying ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And\nafter all this some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him\nthe Rising Sun Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite\nunbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever been treated in this\nmanner. Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance, and remained till\ndaylight in an attitude of deep thought.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III\n\n\nThe next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed\nthe ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. \"I have\nno wish,\" he said, \"to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say\nthat, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,\"--a very just remark,\nat which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.\n\n\"Upon the other hand,\" he continued, \"if he really declines to use the\nRising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him. It\nwould be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside\nthe bedrooms.\"\n\nFor the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the\nblood-stain on the library floor. This certainly was very strange, as\nthe door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept\nclosely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a\ngood deal of comment. Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red,\nthen it would be vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came\ndown for family prayers, according to the simple rites of the Free\nAmerican Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright\nemerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party\nvery much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening. The\nonly person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia, who,\nfor some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the\nsight of the blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was\nemerald-green.\n\nThe second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in\nthe hall. Rushing down-stairs, they found that a large suit of old\narmour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone\nfloor, while seated in a high-backed chair was the Canterville ghost,\nrubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face. The\ntwins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged\ntwo pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained\nby long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United\nStates Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in\naccordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost\nstarted up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a\nmist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so\nleaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase\nhe recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of\ndemoniac laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely\nuseful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single\nnight, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French\ngovernesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly\nlaughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and\nrang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door\nopened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown. \"I am\nafraid you are far from well,\" she said, \"and have brought you a bottle\nof Doctor Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a\nmost excellent remedy.\" The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at\nonce to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an\naccomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family\ndoctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's\nuncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps,\nhowever, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself\nwith becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep\nchurchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.\n\nOn reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the\nmost violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross\nmaterialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what\nreally distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit\nof mail. He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by\nthe sight of a Spectre in armour, if for no more sensible reason, at\nleast out of respect for their natural poet Longfellow, over whose\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\nhour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides it was his own suit.\n\nHe had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament, and had\nbeen highly complimented on it by no less a person than the Virgin Queen\nherself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely overpowered\nby the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen\nheavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees severely, and\nbruising the knuckles of his right hand.\n\nFor some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of\nhis room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.\n\nHowever, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to\nmake a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his\nfamily. He selected Friday, August 17th, for his appearance, and spent\nmost of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in\nfavour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet\nfrilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards evening a\nviolent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was\njust such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to\nmake his way quietly to Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the\nfoot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\nof low music. He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville\nblood-stain by means of Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent. Having reduced\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and\nhis wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead,\nwhile he hissed into her trembling husband's ear the awful secrets of\nthe charnel-house. With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made\nup his mind. She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and\ngentle. A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more\nthan sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the\ncounterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins, he was quite\ndetermined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be done was, of\ncourse, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling\nsensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each\nother, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse,\ntill they became paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw off the\nwinding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white, bleached bones and\none rolling eyeball, in the character of \"Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's\nSkeleton,\" a r\u00f4le in which he had on more than one occasion produced a\ngreat effect, and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of\n\"Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.\"\n\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the\nlight-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves\nbefore they retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still,\nand, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the\nwindow-panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family\nslept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\ncould hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States. He\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his\nmurdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like\nan evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.\n\nOnce he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only\nthe baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange\nsixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\nin the midnight air. Finally he reached the corner of the passage that\nled to luckless Washington's room. For a moment he paused there, the\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's\nshroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was\ncome. He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had\nhe done so than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid\nhis blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was\nstanding a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous\nas a madman's dream! Its head was bald and burnished; its face round,\nand fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\nfeatures into an eternal grin. From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\nlight, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like\nto his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form. On its breast\nwas a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of\nshame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime,\nand, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\n\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's\njack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler. Once in the\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small\npallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes. After a time, however,\nthe brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to\ngo and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight. Accordingly,\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling\nthat, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid\nof his new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins. On reaching\nthe spot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had\nevidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from\nits hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it\nwas leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable\nattitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his\nhorror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a\nrecumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity\nbed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow\nturnip lying at his feet! Unable to understand this curious\ntransformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there,\nin the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:--\n        +------------------------------------+\n        |         YE OTIS GHOSTE             |\n        | Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook, |\n        |    Beware of Ye Imitationes.       |\n        |   All others are counterfeite.     |\n        +------------------------------------+\nThe whole thing flashed across him. He had been tricked, foiled, and\nout-witted! The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his\ntoothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his\nhead, swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\nschool, that, when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds\nof blood would be wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.\n\nHardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of\na distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh,\nand waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\nreason, did not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back\nto his room, thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose. There he\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was\nexceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which this oath\nhad been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second time. \"Perdition\nseize the naughty fowl,\" he muttered, \"I have seen the day when, with my\nstout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow\nfor me an 'twere in death!\" He then retired to a comfortable lead\ncoffin, and stayed there till evening.\n\n\nCHAPTER: IV\n\n\nThe next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were\ncompletely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five\ndays he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point\nof the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want\nit, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a\nlow, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating\nthe symbolic value of sensuous phenomena. The question of phantasmic\napparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a\ndifferent matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large\noriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every month, and he\ndid not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is\nquite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand,\nhe was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.\n\nFor the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as\nusual between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible\nprecaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots,\ntrod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large\nblack velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for\noiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good\ndeal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of\nprotection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he\nslipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a\nlittle humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see\nthat there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a\ncertain degree, it served his purpose. Still in spite of everything he\nwas not left unmolested. Strings were continually being stretched across\nthe corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion,\nwhile dressed for the part of \"Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley\nWoods,\" he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide,\nwhich the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry\nChamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged\nhim, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and\nsocial position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the\nnext night in his celebrated character of \"Reckless Rupert, or the\nHeadless Earl.\"\n\nHe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in\nfact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means\nof it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord\nCanterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome\nJack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\ndown the terrace at twilight. Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\nLord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken\nheart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it\nhad been a great success. It was, however an extremely difficult\n\"make-up,\" if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more\nscientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three\nhours to make his preparations. At last everything was ready, and he was\nvery pleased with his appearance. The big leather riding-boots that went\nwith the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\nfind one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite\nsatisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting\nand crept down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins,\nwhich I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of\nthe colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make\nan effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water\nfell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his\nleft shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed. The shock to his\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\ncould go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold. The only\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\nhad not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences\nmight have been very serious.\n\nHe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,\nand contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in\nlist slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\ndraughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the\ntwins. The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September. He\nhad gone down-stairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that\nthere, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing\nhimself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of\nthe United States Minister and his wife which had now taken the place of\nthe Canterville family pictures. He was simply but neatly clad in a long\nshroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip\nof yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In\nfact, he was dressed for the character of \"Jonas the Graveless, or the\nCorpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,\" one of his most remarkable\nimpersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to\nremember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their\nneighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a quarter-past two o'clock in\nthe morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring. As\nhe was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any\ntraces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a\ndark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads,\nand shrieked out \"BOO!\" in his ear.\n\nSeized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural,\nhe rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him\nthere with the big garden-syringe, and being thus hemmed in by his\nenemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the\ngreat iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to\nmake his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own\nroom in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.\n\nAfter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins\nlay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\nservants, but it was of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings\nwere so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed\nhis great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had\nbeen engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized a wonderful\nclam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse\neuchre, poker, and other American national games, and Virginia rode\nabout the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire,\nwho had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville\nChase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in\nfact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who,\nin reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best\ncongratulations to the Minister's worthy wife.\n\nThe Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the\nhouse, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let\nmatters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the\nyoung Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had\nonce bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice\nwith the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the\nfloor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state that, though\nhe lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but\n\"Double Sixes.\" The story was well known at the time, though, of course,\nout of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt\nwas made to hush it up, and a full account of all the circumstances\nconnected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle's\nRecollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends. The ghost, then,\nwas naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence\nover the Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his\nown first cousin having been married en secondes noces to the Sieur de\nBulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are\nlineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to\nVirginia's little lover in his celebrated impersonation of \"The Vampire\nMonk, or the Bloodless Benedictine,\" a performance so horrible that when\nold Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in\nthe year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which\nculminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after\ndisinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and\nleaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment,\nhowever, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the\nlittle Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal\nBedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.\n\n\nCHAPTER: V\n\n\nA few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out\nriding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting\nthrough a hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go\nup by the back staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past\nthe Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied\nshe saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother's maid, who\nsometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend\nher habit. To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville\nGhost himself! He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of\nthe yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing\nmadly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his hand, and his\nwhole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so forlorn, and so\nmuch out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea\nhad been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity,\nand determined to try and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so\ndeep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she\nspoke to him.\n\n\"I am so sorry for you,\" she said, \"but my brothers are going back to\nEton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy\nyou.\"\n\n\"It is absurd asking me to behave myself,\" he answered, looking round in\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,\n\"quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and\nwalk about at night, if that is what you mean. It is my only reason for\nexisting.\"\n\n\"It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very\nwicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had\nkilled your wife.\"\n\n\"Well, I quite admit it,\" said the Ghost, petulantly, \"but it was a\npurely family matter, and concerned no one else.\"\n\n\"It is very wrong to kill any one,\" said Virginia, who at times had a\nsweet puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.\n\n\"Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very\nplain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about\ncookery. Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent\npricket, and do you know how she had it sent to table? However, it is\nno matter now, for it is all over, and I don't think it was very nice of\nher brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.\"\n\n\"Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost--I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry? I\nhave a sandwich in my case. Would you like it?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you,\nall the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\nvulgar, dishonest family.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Virginia, stamping her foot, \"it is you who are rude, and\nhorrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the\npaints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain\nin the library. First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and\nI couldn't do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the\nchrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese\nwhite, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing\nto look at, and not at all easy to paint. I never told on you, though I\nwas very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for\nwho ever heard of emerald-green blood?\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" said the Ghost, rather meekly, \"what was I to do? It is\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother\nbegan it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I\nshould not have your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of\ntaste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest\nin England; but I know you Americans don't care for things of this\nkind.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\nand improve your mind. My father will be only too happy to give you a\nfree passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind,\nthere will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are\nall Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\nhave a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family ghost.\"\n\n\"I don't think I should like America.\"\n\n\"I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,\" said Virginia,\nsatirically.\n\n\"No ruins! no curiosities!\" answered the Ghost; \"you have your navy and\nyour manners.\"\n\n\"Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week's\nholiday.\"\n\n\"Please don't go, Miss Virginia,\" he cried; \"I am so lonely and so\nunhappy, and I really don't know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I\ncannot.\"\n\n\"That's quite absurd! You have merely to go to bed and blow out the\ncandle. It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\nchurch, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why, even\nbabies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.\"\n\n\"I have not slept for three hundred years,\" he said sadly, and\nVirginia's beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; \"for three hundred\nyears I have not slept, and I am so tired.\"\n\nVirginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like\nrose-leaves. She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked\nup into his old withered face.\n\n\"Poor, poor Ghost,\" she murmured; \"have you no place where you can\nsleep?\"\n\n\"Far away beyond the pine-woods,\" he answered, in a low, dreamy voice,\n\"there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\nsings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold crystal\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\nsleepers.\"\n\nVirginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\n\n\"You mean the Garden of Death,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth,\nwith the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have\nno yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at\npeace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of death's\nhouse, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death\nis.\"\n\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\nthere was silence. She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\n\nThen the ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of\nthe wind.\n\n\"Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?\"\n\n\"Oh, often,\" cried the little girl, looking up; \"I know it quite well.\n\nIt is painted in curious black letters, and is difficult to read. There\nare only six lines:\n    \"'When a golden girl can win\n    Prayer from out the lips of sin,\n    When the barren almond bears,\n    And a little child gives away its tears,\n    Then shall all the house be still\n    And peace come to Canterville.'\n\n\"But I don't know what they mean.\"\n\n\"They mean,\" he said, sadly, \"that you must weep with me for my sins,\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle,\nthe angel of death will have mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\ncannot prevail.\"\n\nVirginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair\nas he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes. \"I am not afraid,\" she said\nfirmly, \"and I will ask the angel to have mercy on you.\"\n\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as\nhe led her across the dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were\nbroidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back. \"Go back! little Virginia,\"\n\nthey cried, \"go back!\" but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly,\nand she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails\nand goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and\nmurmured, \"Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,\"\n\nbut the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When\nthey reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she\ncould not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly\nfading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A\nbitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her\ndress. \"Quick, quick,\" cried the Ghost, \"or it will be too late,\" and\nin a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry\nChamber was empty.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VI\n\n\nAbout ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not\ncome down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia\nanywhere. As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\nevening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all\nalarmed at first, but when six o'clock struck, and Virginia did not\nappear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for\nher, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house. At\nhalf-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\nof their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of\nexcitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly\nremembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies\npermission to camp in the park. He accordingly at once set off for\nBlackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son\nand two of the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire, who was\nperfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too,\nbut Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a\nscuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gipsies had\ngone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as\nthe fire was still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.\n\nHaving sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran\nhome, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the\ncounty, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been\nkidnapped by tramps or gipsies. He then ordered his horse to be brought\nround, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down\nto dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with a groom. He had hardly,\nhowever, gone a couple of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after\nhim, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with\nhis face very flushed, and no hat. \"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,\" gasped\nout the boy, \"but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.\n\nPlease don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year,\nthere would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me back,\nwill you? I can't go! I won't go!\"\n\nThe Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace,\nand was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down\nfrom his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, \"Well,\nCecil, if you won't go back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must\nget you a hat at Ascot.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!\" cried the little Duke, laughing,\nand they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of\nthe station-master if any one answering to the description of Virginia\nhad been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her. The\nstation-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him\nthat a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a\nhat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his\nshutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away,\nwhich he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as there was a\nlarge common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman, but\ncould get no information from him, and, after riding all over the\ncommon, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase\nabout eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found\nWashington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with\nlanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest trace of\nVirginia had been discovered. The gipsies had been caught on Brockley\nmeadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they should be late. Indeed, they had\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's disappearance, as they\nwere very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his\npark, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search.\n\nThe carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone\nover, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any\nrate, Virginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest\ndepression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they\nfound a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\nwas poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and\nhaving her forehead bathed with eau de cologne by the old housekeeper.\n\nMr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up\nsupper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one\nspoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very\nfond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the\nentreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that\nnothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in\nthe morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down\nimmediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight\nbegan to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded\nthey heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder\nshook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a\npanel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out\non the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her\nhand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs.\nOtis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with\nviolent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.\n\n\"Good heavens! child, where have you been?\" said Mr. Otis, rather\nangrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them.\n\n\"Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and\nyour mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these\npractical jokes any more.\"\n\n\"Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!\" shrieked the twins, as they\ncapered about.\n\n\"My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side\nagain,\" murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair.\n\n\"Papa,\" said Virginia, quietly, \"I have been with the Ghost. He is dead,\nand you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was\nreally sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of\nbeautiful jewels before he died.\"\n\nThe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave\nand serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a\nlighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they\ncame to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia\ntouched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves\nin a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated\nwindow. Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was\na gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone\nfloor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers\nan old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its\nreach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was\ncovered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but\na pile of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding\nher little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the\nparty looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\ndisclosed to them.\n\n\"Hallo!\" suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out\nof the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\nsituated. \"Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.\"\n\n\"God has forgiven him,\" said Virginia, gravely, as she rose to her feet,\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.\n\n\"What an angel you are!\" cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round\nher neck, and kissed her.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VII\n\n\nFour days after these curious incidents, a funeral started from\nCanterville Chase at about eleven o'clock at night. The hearse was drawn\nby eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\nnodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\npurple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville\ncoat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\nservants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully\nimpressive. Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up\nspecially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first\ncarriage along with little Virginia. Then came the United States\nMinister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the\nlast carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had\nbeen frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she\nhad a right to see the last of him. A deep grave had been dug in the\ncorner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service\nwas read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, the servants, according to an old custom\nobserved in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as\nthe coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward,\nand laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms. As\nshe did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its\nsilent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a\nnightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of the\nGarden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a\nword during the drive home.\n\nThe next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given\nto Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby\nnecklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen\nof sixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis\nfelt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"I know that in this country mortmain is held to\napply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that\nthese jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg\nyou, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you\nunder certain strange conditions. As for my daughter, she is merely a\nchild, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such\nappurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I\nmay say, is no mean authority upon Art,--having had the privilege of\nspending several winters in Boston when she was a girl,--that these gems\nare of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\nprice. Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you\nwill recognize how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\nin the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such\nvain gauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\nBritish aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who\nhave been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles\nof Republican simplicity. Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box, as a memento of\nyour unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is extremely old, and\nconsequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to\ncomply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good deal\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with medi\u00e6valism\nin any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was\nborn in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned\nfrom a trip to Athens.\"\n\nLord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister's speech,\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile,\nand when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\nsaid: \"My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky\nancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are\nmuch indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck. The jewels\nare clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough\nto take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave\nin a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. As for their being\nheirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or\nlegal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite\nunknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and\nwhen Miss Virginia grows up, I dare say she will be pleased to have\npretty things to wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the\nfurniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to\nthe ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity\nSir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he\nwas really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase.\"\n\nMr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville's refusal, and\nbegged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was\nquite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to\nretain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of\n1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's first\ndrawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the\nuniversal theme of admiration. For Virginia received the coronet, which\nis the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her\nboy-lover as soon as he came of age. They were both so charming, and\nthey loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the\nmatch, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch\nthe Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less\nthan three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to\nsay, Mr. Otis himself. Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke\npersonally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his\nown words, \"was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating\ninfluences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of\nRepublican simplicity should be forgotten.\" His objections, however,\nwere completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the\naisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his\narm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of\nEngland.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to\nCanterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over\nin the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods. There had\nbeen a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir\nSimon's tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it\nsimply the initials of the old gentleman's name, and the verse from the\nlibrary window. The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses,\nwhich she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for\nsome time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There\nthe Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her\nfeet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly\nhe threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her,\n\"Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.\"\n\n\"Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have,\" he answered, smiling, \"you have never told me what\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.\"\n\n\"I have never told any one, Cecil,\" said Virginia, gravely.\n\n\"I know that, but you might tell me.\"\n\n\"Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you. Poor Sir Simon! I owe\nhim a great deal. Yes, don't laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see\nwhat Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than\nboth.\"\n\nThe Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.\n\n\"You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,\" he murmured.\n\n\"You have always had that, Cecil.\"\n\n\"And you will tell our children some day, won't you?\"\n\nVirginia blushed.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.\n\nYet Millet would have us understand that in spite of this, the\nshepherd is performing a duty to humanity not to be underrated. The\nsheep he has so carefully and conscientiously reared will form food\nto-morrow for many a hungry town-dweller. Further, he would have us\nfollow the peasant as he closes the pen for the night and traces his\ntired steps towards his simple home in the village. The frugal and\nhard-earned meal, prepared for him by his wife, who like himself has\nhad her share of duties to occupy her during the day, is partaken of\nsurrounded by a hungry and joyous group of children. Such themes\nsuggested by the simplicity of his own life appealed to him with\nirresistible force, and it is in their portrayal that his greatness is\nmanifested.\n\nPerhaps no season of the year presented the same attraction for Millet\nas the spring. The period when all the earth after its long winter\nsleep is about to waken into new life seems to have always been a\nsource of inspiration to him. In \"The Sower\" he emphasises the fact\nthat the fruits of the harvest are not to be had without due labour\nbeing expended upon the earth. The sloping field, barren of\nvegetation, and crowned at the top with a small clump of trees, is\nbeing broken up by the distant plough drawn by two horses and guided\nby a peasant. The latter figure is one of the noblest of Millet's\ncreations. By his strained and ever-attentive attitude, by his\ncontinuous tramp over the rough and broken ground, he shows us the\nmonotony of his toil. He crosses the field in one direction, only to\nreturn at an interval of a few feet. In the foreground we have the\nsower, a middle-aged man of typical peasant type, on whose left side a\nbag of seeds is slung. With automatic precision he withdraws a\nhandful, and strews it into the furrows open to receive it. So long as\nhe continues in the same track his labour will be well performed, and\nhence his task is just as monotonous as that of his fellow-worker\nhigher up in the field. The silhouetting of these two figures against\nthe light is symbolical of the labour to be expended in life before\nresults are forthcoming.\n\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that in considering the works of\nMillet, one must not judge him from the standpoint of a mere painter.\n\nHis brush is only the means to an end, and by its means he is enabled\nto bring the fruits of his philosophic observation before us in\npermanent form. It has been charged against the \"Angelus\" that it was\nnot a remarkably fine piece of painting, that many a young artist of\nthe present generation is infinitely better equipped, technically\nspeaking, than the master who wrought this celebrated canvas. This may\nin a measure be true, but it must never be forgotten that Millet\nbrought into play exactly the means which could illustrate his meaning\nin the clearest terms. He had not intended, in painting such a\npicture, to produce a work which would astonish his fellow artists\nwith its brilliancy of handling or magnificence of colour. He wanted\nto make the beholder forget the painter and absorb the lesson. This\nquality runs right through the art of Millet, and it is from this\nstandpoint that we are obliged to weigh his merits.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE\n\n\nJean Fran\u00e7ois Millet was born on October 4, 1814, that is at the\nperiod when French art, at any rate as far as landscape painting is\nconcerned, had reached its lowest ebb. Throughout the eighteenth\ncentury the landscape painter had been hard put to make a living. The\ntaste of connoisseurs throughout the century had been for portraits\nand interiors, or for those numerous pastoral subjects which were\ncarried out with so much decorative charm by such men as Watteau and\nBoucher. Such landscape painting as existed was of the type\npopularised by Vernet; it was built upon a curious mixture of Italian\ninfluence coming from Panini and Salvator Rosa. The only evidence of\nrevolt against such a state of affairs we find in the works of Hubert\nRobert and Moreau. These two, and more especially would I direct the\nreader's attention to the latter, struggled hard to break down the\nconventionalities of the time. They endeavoured to infuse some sense\nof atmosphere into their pictures, and whilst frequently their trees\nand figures are painfully formal, they yet stand alone in the French\nschool as the pioneers of a phase of art which was to attain its\nzenith in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBut after the Revolution, and during the whole of the time that France\nwas under the domination of Napoleon, very rigid principles indeed\nwere enforced with regard to the direction that art should take. The\ninnovation which had its commencement in the reign of Louis XVI. swept\neverything before it as it gained force. Classical art and traditions\ndominated the whole French school, and no artist, however great his\nreputation, attempted for many years to swim against the stream. In\nspite of the principles of liberty and equality which were claimed for\nall under the new r\u00e9gime, a terribly strict eye was kept upon any\ninnovations which might break out in the form of a naturalistic art.\n\nThe directors of this new movement failed to see that the conditions\nwhich had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed\naway, and that the latter's supremacy was due to the fact that their\nproductions were symbolical of the loftiest thoughts of their own\nepoch. The art which expresses the ambitions and noblest thoughts of\nits time will alone endure. These expressions are not applicable to\nany other condition than those which called them forth, and hence in\nattempting to purify the rococo which had existed up to the middle of\nthe eighteenth century, by a return to classical traditions, they were\nonly copying that which their predecessors had done, and in so doing\nleft us without any original expression of their own time.\n\nInto such a condition of affairs was Millet born, and he was numbered\namongst that little band of men which included Rousseau, Corot, Dupr\u00e9,\nDiaz, and Daumier, who were to lay the foundations of the modern\nnaturalistic school. At the outset it was seemingly a hopeless\nstruggle they undertook; a struggle against prejudice and influence\nwhich was only to be brought to a victorious culmination after years\nof struggle and disappointment. Of this little band, Millet was\nperhaps the best equipped for the privations which were necessary. He\ncame of a peasant stock who inhabited Gruchy, a small village\nsituated in the commune of Gr\u00e9ville, close to Cherbourg. Grouped\nunderneath the humble roof was the grandmother, who had been left a\nwidow fifteen years before; her son, Jean Louis Nicolas Millet, and\nhis wife and eight children, of which our artist was the second. His\ngrandmother appears to have been a pious old lady, whose chief delight\nwas in her grandchildren, to whom she taught those religious\nprinciples which stood them in good stead in after life. We are told\nthat Millet's father possessed a force of character one does not often\nfind amongst men in his rank of life. He was of a contemplative\ndisposition, and had a keenly developed feeling for natural beauty. He\npossessed moreover a keen appreciation of music, which unfortunately\nhe does not appear to have had much opportunity of cultivating. His\nwife was an excellent housewife and of a religious turn of mind. The\nhouse they occupied, situated quite a short distance from the sea, was\nplaced in a tract of country which, whilst it had rugged and\npicturesque features, was not of a nature which would yield\nextraordinary results under cultivation. It was, therefore, a hard\nstruggle for existence which Millet in his first years saw going\non around him. Not that the family were any the less happy for having\nto work laboriously for their livelihood. They had been brought up\namidst such surroundings; their wants were simple and easily\ngratified, and the tranquillity of the m\u00e9nage more than\ncounterbalanced those doubtful luxuries which easier circumstances\nwould have brought their way. Throughout his life Millet maintained\nthe extreme simplicity he had seen practised in the home of his\nchildhood, and long years afterwards he was accustomed to look back\nwith pleasureable memories upon his early years.\n\nGruchy, situated in one of the wildest parts of Normandy, feels the\nfull effect of every storm which blows up from the Atlantic. There is\nnothing to shelter the exposed hamlets studded along the coast from\nthe fury of the western gale, and the rocks are but too often strewn\nwith the wrecks of vessels which have come to grief in that terrible\nsea. Millet in his youth must have witnessed many of these\ncatastrophes. Quite a number of drawings by him are extant\nrepresenting succour being extended to some vessel in difficulties, or\nthe hauling up of some wreckage on to the rocks. The studious boy\nmust have been impressed as he saw the sternness of the combat in his\nnative country between men and nature; the wind-swept fields, and\nhills bare to the point of savageness. The very trees themselves\ndwarfed and gnarled; in their struggle with the elements they have\nbeen made tough and hardy as the inhabitants of the country\nthemselves, and, stunted as they are, yet show well that they can\nresist the force of the fiercest storm. The brooding and contemplative\ncharacter of the father having descended to the son, we can quite\nimagine the effect such surroundings would have upon him. As he looked\nback in after years upon his roamings in his native country, he\nappreciated the awe-inspiring character of the scenery in which he had\nbeen born. He would doubtless recall many a walk amidst the fields\nwith the wind blowing in his face as it rushed in from the Atlantic,\nthe rain beating hard upon the freshly ploughed fields, and the\ndistant figure of the ploughman struggling hard with his team against\nthe stiff sou'wester. The great mass of vapour overhead whirled before\nthe violence of the storm, casting grey and pearly light over the\nwhole scene, whilst far away on the top of the hill a clump of trees,\nbent with their resistance to the wind, are silhouetted against the\nsky. Many a drawing of this kind we encounter in the later work of\nMillet, which shows how his thoughts harked back in certain moments to\nthe scenes he had left behind him for ever.\n\nWe know that on one or two occasions he returned to Gruchy. Once or\ntwice he had urgent business which took him back, but sometimes he\nwent with no other purpose than to renew acquaintance with the scenes\nof yore.\n\nLittle Jean Fran\u00e7ois was his grandmother's favourite. It was she who\ntaught him the names of things which surrounded him, and perhaps\ndirected his thoughts in the channels to which they were finally to be\ndevoted. Her brother Charles, who formed one of the family, used to\ntake him for walks, telling him stories on the way. Millet was\ndevotedly attached to this old man, and when at the age of seven years\nhe lost him, the gap in his life thus left made an impression upon his\nmemory never to be effaced.\n\nFive years afterwards he was placed in the hands of the vicar for the\npurpose of preparing him for his first communion. The good man seems\nto have been taken with the child; he found him so attentive to all\nnatural phenomenon which was passing around him and intelligent in an\nunusual degree. He quickly learnt a considerable amount of Latin,\nwhich introduced him to the great classics. Unfortunately for Millet,\nthe vicar accepted an offer of transference to a better parish in the\nvicinity. The boy had made such progress with his master that it was\ndecided that he should go with him to his new abode. He was, however,\nso missed in his own home, that when he came back for his first\nholidays it was decided that he should not return.\n\nHe now gave serious attention to the agricultural pursuits of his\nfather. He threw himself heartily into the work of the farm, and\nassisted in the work of sowing and harvesting, of pruning and\nthrashing according to the season. His spare time was occupied in\nreading with avidity various masterpieces of literature. The authors\nhe found at hand were such as F\u00e9n\u00e9lon and Bossuet, but he developed a\ndecided preference, which lasted till the end of his life, for Virgil\nand the Bible.\n\nIt was at this time that his taste for art began to be developed.\n\nHe drew the objects he found around him, and soon acquired sufficient\nconfidence in his skill to execute a large drawing representing two\nshepherds keeping guard over their sheep. These first efforts date\nfrom about his seventeenth year, and foretell the advent of the style\nin which he was later to become pre-eminent.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE MIGRATION TO PARIS\n\n\nHow frequently has it happened that the first years in the life of a\ngenius have been employed in labour quite different from that to which\nthey should have been directed. Such a state of affairs the more often\noccurs when the sense of duty has been strong enough to overcome\ntemporarily the inclination to pursue the natural bent. In the case of\nMillet, however, the early years which he devoted to the farm and its\npursuits were by no means wasted. It is on record that he became very\nproficient in the various duties in which he was engaged, but at the\nsame time we can be quite sure that his extraordinary faculties of\nobservation were constantly being brought into play, and the fruits of\nhis observations are to be seen in the pictures of his mature period.\n\nA considerable portion of his spare time was taken up with drawing,\nnot only the persons and objects he found around him, but also\nsubjects suggested to him by the books he was in the habit of reading.\n\nHis family, so far from throwing any obstacles in his way, encouraged\nhim. In fact it was his father who took him first to Cherbourg in\norder to show a painter of that town, named Mouchel, the early\nproducts of his son's genius. The decision at which Millet p\u00e8re had\narrived was prompted by a drawing in charcoal of an old peasant\nwalking along the road, which had struck him forcibly as being a work\nof extraordinary merit. It says much for Mouchel's breadth of mind\nthat he was equally impressed with the drawings. A man who had been\nbrought up in the school of David, and who had lived in one of the\nmost reactionary periods of French art, was hardly to be expected to\ntake kindly to a style so diametrically opposed to all the traditions\ninto which he himself had been inculcated; certainly the young\nMillet, who had now arrived at the age of eighteen, had not developed\nthe extraordinary freedom which his works of ten years later\ndemonstrate. But there was sufficient originality even in his early\ndrawings to call forth condemnation from a man who had been so\nsaturated with the teaching of David.\n\nHe prevailed upon Millet to leave his son with him, and set him to\nwork to copy many well-known works of art which he brought before his\npupil by means of engravings. Two months were spent in this way when\nnews reached Millet that his father had been seized with sudden\nillness, and he was obliged in the circumstances to return to\nGr\u00e9ville. He arrived to find the old man unconscious, and very shortly\nafterwards he died.\n\nThis misfortune awoke in Millet a sense of duty which compelled him to\ndesert his studies in Cherbourg and superintend the management of the\nfarm. For some time he devoted himself entirely to his new duties, but\nthe struggle betwixt duty and genius continued; he gave himself to his\nwork with all the energy at his disposal, but his thoughts were ever\nwandering to his art.\n\nAdded to his own inclinations, his grandmother, who perceived his\nextraordinary gifts, strongly persuaded him to devote his attention\nentirely to art, and consequently after some little time he decided to\nreturn to Cherbourg. Here he entered the studio of M. Langlois, an\nartist whose reputation in the town was considerable. Again in this\nworthy man he came in contact with a painter who had been brought up\nentirely under classical influence. Langlois, who had in his early\ndays been a pupil of Gros, had absorbed the classical tradition to\nsuch an extent as to be incapable of appreciating any other style. He\nappears to have endeavoured to mould Millet in his own method rather\nthan develop the latent genius which the latter possessed. The\nincompatibility of these two men speedily caused the younger to strike\nout in his own way. He saw more good in frequenting the museums and\nmaking copies of such works as appealed to him than in listening to\nthe advice of his teacher. All this occurred, however, without any\nbreach of friendship occurring. On the contrary, Langlois, after\nperceiving the futility of inducing his pupil to follow in his\nfootsteps, did all he could to advance his interests.\n\nBy means of his influence some of Millet's drawings were brought\nbefore the Municipal Council, and Langlois suggested that Millet\nshould be sent to Paris in order to further his development, and that\nthe Council should set aside a modest pension to meet his requirements\nin that city. The discussion appears to have been very prolonged, and\nupon the question being put to a vote it was only carried by means of\nthe casting vote of the mayor. Four hundred francs was at first\nallotted to him in this way, which was further increased shortly\nafterwards to six hundred. Such encouragement, meagre though it was,\nwas sufficient to give him a foothold in the metropolis. He left\nCherbourg in January 1837, on a cold and raw day, the snow falling\nheavily throughout the entire journey, and arrived in Paris in a very\ndisheartened condition. The miserable weather, coupled with the long\njourney in which he had had time to think of the small sum which lay\nbetween him and starvation, going to a city which he had never seen\nbefore, had all served to work upon his nerves, and he entered the\ngreat city sick at heart and very despondent.\n\nOne of the first visits he made after he was somewhat settled down in\nParis was to the Louvre. Here he was brought into contact for the\nfirst time with many masters, who were to mould his yet plastic\ntemperament into the form which enabled him to give to the world, in\nlater years, so many masterpieces. As I have said before, it was\nMantegna who first captivated him, and the influence of the mighty\nPaduan was never finally to be shaken off. Michel Angelo awed him with\nhis sublimity; his classical severity tempered with intense humanism,\nhis masculine strength, were bound to have their effect upon so\nserious a character as Millet. Strange as it may seem to those who are\nbut superficially acquainted with his art, and are only too apt to\njudge him by the influence he has had upon modern French painting, he\nwas fascinated with the antique. The traditions of Phidias and\nPraxiteles, in the form in which they had been transmitted through the\ngreatest minds of the Renaissance, were ever the factors which guided\nhim throughout his career. It was this same spirit which impelled his\nfervid admiration for Nicolas Poussin, a master who to-day is sadly\nunderrated and but little understood. It was the mysteries of line,\nthe wonders of pose and composition rather than the magic of colour\nwhich appealed to him. He had a profound admiration for the glowing\ncanvases of Titian and Rubens, but he could never overlook entirely\ntheir defects of drawing or, in the case of Rubens, the tendency to\nvulgarity. From his remarks in after years it would appear that he was\nbaffled with the mysticisms of Velazquez and Rembrandt; pure painting\nitself could never hold him. He needed to grasp the message which lay\nbehind it before he felt fully taken into the confidence of the\npainter; and as the minds of the Dutchman and the Spaniard ran in\nquite different channels to his own, they spoke with a language he\nnever understood. That he had a perceptive and critically independent\nmind may be gauged from his enthusiasm for Delacroix, whose work he\nencountered for the first time at the Luxembourg.\n\nDuring this period of study he was carefully considering under what\nmaster he should place himself. His choice unhappily fell upon\nDelaroche. To any one acquainted with the work of the latter master,\na more unsuitable selection could not have been made. Delaroche and\nthe painters who surrounded him can be appropriately described as\nconstituting the back-wash of the Empire style, which had reached its\nclimax with David. His subjects were always treated with academic\nreserve. No pyrotechnics were permitted; on the contrary, an\neverlasting and mistaken striving for finish was encouraged:\noriginality was sternly suppressed. To paint human life as it really\nwas, was too vulgar for any of the painters of this time. They held\nthe public taste enslaved for years. An innovator such as Millet was\ndestined to become found his position almost untenable. The band of\ncritics and painters formed a monopoly which it seemed almost\nimpossible to break down, and it was only after years of bitter and\ndetermined struggle that the school of nature finally routed its\nopponent.\n\nDelaroche doubtlessly found the peasant painter a little rude both in\nhis person and in his ideas about art. He paid but little attention to\nthe young man who had placed himself in his hands, and devoted all his\ntime to students who were more amenable to his influence. A\ntemperament so sensitive as Millet's was bound to notice this\nneglect, and consequently after a time he became so discouraged that\nhe ceased to frequent Delaroche's studio. Another very good reason for\nthis action was the lack of resources to continue his payments. Even\nduring the time he had been with Delaroche he lost no opportunity of\nturning a few honest francs by painting the portraits of any who could\nbe got to sit to him. Delaroche, however, had a more kindly heart than\nMillet imagined. He seems to have found out the real distress of the\nyoung artist, and to have assisted him pecuniarily in many ways, and\nthere is no doubt that he appreciated the talent of the young Norman\nmuch more than he cared to own. Many of his remarks on record would\nserve to show that Delaroche already felt that his pupil was destined\nto be one of the leaders of the movement which was finally to\noverthrow his own style, and doubtlessly felt a great admiration for a\nman who had the courage and strength to swim against rather than with\nthe current.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STRUGGLE FOR RECOGNITION\n\n\nFreed from all encumbrances save poverty, Millet was now to work out\nhis own destiny according to the dictates of his genius. He joined a\nfriend named Marolle, and the two together occupying a very small\napartment endeavoured to eke out an existence. It was only too soon\napparent that young as he was, and the taste of the public being not\nyet ready for development upon the lines his genius directed him, that\nhis livelihood could not be secured by endeavouring to sell such\nsubjects as appealed to him. In these straits he turned to\nportrait-painting, just as many great painters before and since him\nhave done. That the struggle was very keen can well be imagined by the\nfact that he was unable to obtain more than five to ten francs apiece;\nand, as commissions were very scarce, he was hard put to gain the\nmeans of subsistence. This state of affairs lasted until 1840, in\nwhich year he endeavoured to obtain admission to the Salon with two\nportraits, one of which was that of his friend. This, however, was\nrejected, and the other picture, although accepted, was unnoticed by\neither the critics or the public.\n\nHaving occasion the next year to pay a visit to Cherbourg, he felt\nobliged to report himself to the Municipal Council who had had the\ngenerosity to send him in the first place to Paris. Its worthy members\nexpressed themselves as but little satisfied with the result of their\ninvestment; they claimed that they had had as yet but little to show\nfor their money, and they suggested, partly as a means of\ndemonstrating that they had had some little return, and also, in order\nto see of what stuff their prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was made, that he should paint a\nportrait of the recently deceased mayor. As Millet had not been\npersonally acquainted with that worthy citizen, and as the only guide\nwhich could be supplied him was a portrait made in miniature when he\nwas a young man of some twenty-three or twenty-four years of age, the\ntask was by no means easy. However, the artist set to work with a\nwill, and finally accomplished the picture to his own satisfaction.\n\nUpon it being shown to the Council, one and all declared, as any one\nwith the slightest knowledge of such matters could have told them\nbefore it was commenced, that it bore not the least resemblance to the\ndefunct magistrate. They therefore demurred at the three hundred\nfrancs they had agreed to pay him for the portrait, and offered him\none-third of that amount instead. Millet was deeply offended by the\ninsult, and informed the Council that he made them a present of the\npicture.\n\nIt was during this short visit to his native country that he met his\nfirst wife, a Mlle. Ono, whose portrait he had painted. From the first\nshe was very delicate, and he lost her after much suffering, three\nyears later. His second wife was Mlle. Catherine Lemaire, who was\ndestined to be the companion of his struggles until the end of his\nlife.\n\nMeanwhile Millet was occupied with subjects which he thought would\nappeal to the general public. A number of classical pictures date from\nthis epoch. It was an endeavour on his part to fall in as far as\npossible with the current taste, and so supply means of subsistence\nfor his family. At the same time he did not neglect his favourite\nsubjects, and many are the wonderful studies of peasant life which\ndate from these years. His reputation had so far advanced that he was\noffered the position of teacher of drawing in the college at\nCherbourg. It must have been only after prolonged deliberation that he\nrefused the proffered post. Here a certain annual stipend was assured\nhim, and if it was not large in itself it would at any rate suffice to\nkeep the wolf from the door. He preferred, however, to return to Paris\nand work out his own destiny as best he might.\n\nMillet, who lived at this time in the Rue Rochechouart, began to\nsurround himself with that little group of friends who remained\nfaithful to him until the end of his career. Amongst the earliest were\nCharles Jacque and Diaz: the latter had several clients amongst the\nsmall dealers, whom he induced to visit Millet's studio and make now\nand again a small purchase.\n\nMillet now became a fairly regular contributor to the Salon, but\ngenerally sent some classical or religious picture as well as one of\nhis peasant subjects. For example, in 1848 he sent the marvellous\nstudy of \"The Winnower,\" which we all know so well, accompanied by a\ncanvas, \"The Captivity of the Jews at Babylon.\" The latter, however,\nwas so badly received that he utilised the canvas upon its return for\na large picture of a \"Shepherdess tending her Sheep.\"\n\nIn spite of the headway that he was making, the struggle for existence\nseemed keener than ever, and but for the kindness of friends he and\nhis family would frequently have actually wanted for food. A timely\nadvance of one hundred francs obtained for him from the Minister of\nFine Arts, together with a commission from the State, for which he was\npaid the sum of eighteen hundred francs, were for some time the only\nrelief he obtained from his embarrassments. That he was not particular\nas to how he earned his daily bread is apparent from the fact that he\ndid not despise an order for a shop sign for a midwife, for which he\nwas paid the miserable amount of thirty francs.\n\nThe year 1848 was not an encouraging one for a painter who was\nstanding on the threshold of his career. The whole of Europe was\nseething with revolution. A repetition of the fearful year of 1792 was\neverywhere expected. The struggle betwixt reaction and property on the\none hand, and lawlessness and revolution on the other, was being waged\nwith grim determination. The issue was for long in the balance. One\nnever knew from one day to another what was going to happen. In such a\ndeplorable state of affairs men's minds were running on politics and\nwars rather than upon art. Millet amongst the rest was called upon to\nshoulder the musket, and it can be easily imagined with what\nreluctance he did so.\n\nParis, the great centre of art, had yet not afforded him much\nencouragement. Life was dear in the big city, and surrounded on all\nsides by bricks and mortar he was not free to go out into the fields\nand study the objects which were uppermost in his mind. He resolved to\nescape from it, and once having put the plan into execution he never\nreturned.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET IN HIS MATURITY\n\n\nThe Barbizon of 1850 was a very different place from the Barbizon of\nto-day. The world fame of the men who passed a quiet and strenuous\nexistence in the little village has transformed it into a tourist\nresort, with restaurants and caf\u00e9s, the stopping-places for\nwaggonettes which in summer bring their daily load of sightseers,\neager to see the homes of the painters whose names are now household\nwords.\n\nIt would have been well-nigh impossible for the little band to have\nchosen a more suitable spot for their labours. Rousseau and Millet,\nmuch as they were drawn towards each other by the tie of a sympathetic\ndisposition and by their common interest in art, yet were widely\ndissimilar from one another in their outlook upon art and their\nmethods of worship at the common shrine. Rousseau--one can see it from\nevery picture he painted--loved with all the yearning of a passionate\nand restless temperament the inanimate in Nature. Observe with what\nfidelity he draws his trees, with what caressing tenderness his clouds\nand skies are treated; solitude appealed to him above all things, and\nif here and there he was obliged to insert a few figures to complete\nhis composition, one instinctively feels that he would rather have\nsubstituted a group of cattle or a flock of sheep. In the glades of\nthe forest, far from the busy haunts of men, with the glorious\nsunlight penetrating from above, the breeze moaning through the\nbranches, he was happy. A wild and turbulent temperament such as his\nnot infrequently discovers exquisite enjoyment amidst such perfect\ntranquillity.\n\nBarbizon, situated on the fringe of the great forest of Fontainebleau,\ntherefore, permitted Rousseau to come into daily contact with the\nscenes which so appealed to him.\n\nMillet, on the other hand, was absorbed in the peasant. The man who\ntilled the soil and raised the produce humanity requires for its\nsubsistence by the sweat of his brow; the manifold duties of the\nlabourer, his life and sorrows, appealed to him with irresistible\nforce. An unpeopled track of wild and uncultivated land would not call\nforth any emotion in him, no matter how sublime the scenery might be.\n\nThe life of the village, spreading itself into the vast and fertile\nplain behind, held him absorbed; a peasant himself and living amongst\nthe people he so loved, he was in a position to bring before an\nunthinking world the poignant monotony of their useful lives.\n\nUpon their first arrival at Barbizon, the two artists put up at a\nsmall inn, working all day in a tiny place they had rented from some\npeasants and fitted up as a studio. The inconveniences of this\narrangement were soon apparent, and shortly afterwards Millet took a\nsmall house which was destined to be his abode for the remainder of\nhis life; an old barn in the immediate vicinity meanwhile provided him\nwith an excellent studio.\n\nFrom this period onward we must date the greatest productions of the\nmaster, the works which have induced more thought than those of any\nother peasant painter. A peasant among peasants, his life was of the\nmost rigid simplicity. Behind his little abode a large garden\nstretched away almost to the fringe of the forest itself, and here he\nwas accustomed to work every morning, growing a portion of the food\nnecessary to the sustenance of his family. The afternoon he devoted to\npainting, whilst the evening was given over to intercourse with his\nlittle circle of friends. The simplicity and tranquillity of his life\naroused the whole of his powers to action, and surrounded with\neverything he valued in life he was supremely happy.\n\nThe country around Barbizon appealed to him irresistibly. The\ntimber-studded plains, the gently undulating, highly cultivated\nfields, presented a strange contrast to the wild and rugged country\namidst which he had spent his childhood, and no doubt conduced to the\ndevelopment of a more refined and contemplative style than he would\notherwise have acquired. Upon his few visits to his native country he\nappears to have been more impressed than ever with its austerity, and\nthe drawings which these journeys called forth bore ample evidence of\nthis feeling in him.\n\nLack of the necessary funds to carry on even his simple m\u00e9nage was\never the bane of Millet's life. On many occasions Sensier, his\nintimate friend and afterwards his biographer, informs us he dissuaded\nhim from suicide.\n\nThe sums that he owed, small though they were, rendered him in\nconstant fear of the brokers. With creditors so importunate in their\ndemands for satisfaction, and with the constant lack of recognition,\nwhich was his lot, it is astonishing that Millet achieved so much. He\nwas relieved more than once by the kind-hearted and ever faithful\nRousseau, who when his friend was sorest pressed found some delicately\nhidden means to relieve him. It was he who acquired for 4000 francs\nthe wonderful \"Peasant grafting a Tree,\" when the picture failed to\nfind a purchaser; and in order that Millet should not be aware of his\ngenerosity, he made the offer in the name of an imaginary American.\n\nThis sort of goodness he repeated more than once, and it redounds\nstill more to his credit when we remember that Rousseau himself was\nnot infrequently in pecuniary difficulties.\n\nA constant succession of important works made their appearance during\nthe first ten years Millet spent at Barbizon. The first was the\nwell-known \"Sower,\" which has ever been one of the most popular of his\npictures. Then came the far finer \"Peasants going to Work,\" which for\nmany years was in an English Collection. The \"Gleaners,\" perhaps the\nnoblest canvas the master ever painted, dates from 1857, in which year\nit was seen at the Salon; the celebrated \"Angelus\" followed it two\nyears later. The prices which Millet obtained for this series of\nremarkable works was fantastically small. The \"Gleaners\" brought him a\npaltry 2000 francs, whilst he accounted himself lucky to encounter an\namateur who gave him the same sum for the small \"Woman feeding Fowls.\"\n\nThe \"Angelus,\" which was never exhibited, was sold in the year it was\npainted to a Monsieur Feydeau, an architect, for 1800 francs. It then\npassed through several hands before the late Monsieur Secr\u00e9tan\ncompeted up to 160,000 francs before he became possessed of the prize\nat the John Wilson sale.\n\nThe purchase, however, proved a sound investment, for upon the\ndispersal of his collection it was knocked down for 553,000 francs to\na Monsieur Proust, acting on behalf of the French Government. The\nlatter, however, when they gave the commission to buy the picture, had\nno idea that such a high value would be placed upon it, and\nconsequently refused to ratify the sale; a syndicate now came upon the\nscene, who took it to America. The price, however, proved greater than\neven the millionaires of the States were prepared to give, and the\ncanvas again returned to France, where it found a resting-place in the\ncollection of Monsieur Chauchard, who paid the enormous sum of 800,000\nfrancs for its possession.\n\nIn 1859 Millet sent two works to the Salon, a \"Woman grazing her Cow,\"\nand \"Death and the Woodman.\" The latter, one of the most\nphilosophical of Millet's pictures, which to-day is the principal\nattraction of the Jacobsen Museum at Copenhagen, was rejected.\n\nDisappointments of this kind came with such systematic regularity to\nthe painter that he must have become proof against them. He always had\nbitter enemies amongst the critics, who never failed to pour abuse\nupon his method and his subjects. Even a number of his fellow artists\njoined in the chorus of disapproval. But the vehemence with which he\nwas attacked was striking evidence of the impression he was making and\nthe inward sense of his own powers; and the fact that he was working\nout his destiny according to the dictates of his own genius supported\nhim against this outpouring of prejudice and malice. The social side\nof life appealed to him more strongly as the years rolled on, and the\nmurmurings which had been heard in 1859 as to the socialistic\ntendencies of \"Death and the Woodman\" swelled to a roar when the\nstupendous \"Man with the Hoe\" was exhibited fourteen years later. The\nlatter, one of the most virile studies of depraved humanity which the\nworld has ever seen, has always been a favourite with social\nreformers, and has inspired one remarkable poem. Even his most\nimplacable critics were disarmed before this canvas; its power was\nmagnetic; it was an inspiration, soul moving and trenchant.\n\nHis financial difficulties never completely dispersed. At one time, in\norder to insure himself a little tranquillity, he made a contract with\ntwo speculators, whereby they were to become possessors of all the\nwork he produced for three years, in consideration of their assuring\nhim a thousand francs a month. A great number of Millet's finest\nproductions passed thus through their hands, including the \"Return\nfrom the Fields\" and the \"Man with the Hoe.\" The partners were not\nlong in quarrelling, and after a lawsuit had been fought, Millet was\nleft in the hands of a man who frequently would not or could not pay\nhim in ready money, and whose bills he was frequently forced to\ndiscount at considerable loss.\n\nOne little gleam of sunshine rendered his later days happy. This was a\ncommission from a Colmar banker, Monsieur Thomas by name, who required\nfour allegorical compositions representing the Seasons, to decorate\nhis rooms. The artist was overjoyed by this piece of good fortune,\nand immediately commenced a most conscientious study of such mural\ndecoration as was within reach, in order that he might do full justice\nto his patron. He paid frequent visits to Fontainebleau and the\nLouvre, and even desired a friend to inquire if he could not obtain\nreproductions of the frescoes at Herculaneum and Pompeii. In spite of\nall this elaborate preparation, the subjects were not such as appealed\nto his genius, and in spite of them being well and soundly painted, we\nare told that they presented no features which called for special\ncomment.\n\nHe found, however, a much more genial occupation in accomplishing a\nseries of drawings ordered by a Monsieur Gavet, who paid the artist\n1000, 700, and 450 francs each, according to their size. He made\naltogether ninety-five drawings in this way, and it is said that this\ngentleman had in his possession the finest work in black and white and\nwater-colour the artist ever executed.\n\nTowards the latter end of his life the death of dear relatives and\nfriends cast a sorrowful gloom over him. Amongst the latter Rousseau,\nwho expired in his presence on the 22nd of December 1867, was\nperhaps the loss which seemed to him hardest to bear. A staunch and\ntrusty friend, who was to be relied upon when his prospects seemed the\nmost hopeless, he had been one of the very few who had appreciated\nMillet's talents at their full worth, and who, moreover, scanty as his\nown means were, was ever ready to stretch out his hand to assist his\nstruggling friend.\n\nShortly afterwards Millet paid a visit to his patron, Herr Hartmann,\nat M\u00fcnster, and from here he went for a short time into Switzerland.\n\nUpon his return he devoted himself with great earnestness to work, and\nachieved a certain success at the Salons with his exhibits. The\noutbreak of the war with Germany caused him to migrate with his family\nto Cherbourg, where he thought he might continue to work, removed as\nfar as possible from the scenes of carnage and struggle which were\ngoing on farther east. Transported once more amongst the scenes of his\nchildhood, he felt an increased impetus to production, and when he\nreturned to Barbizon late in 1871, he brought with him a number of\ncanvases of the highest quality; conspicuous amongst them was the\nwonderful \"Gr\u00e9ville Church,\" now in the Louvre.\n\nThe anxieties of his troublous life were, however, beginning to show\ntheir effect upon his constitution; a persistent cough developed, and\nalthough an amelioration would occasionally occur, it was always\nsucceeded by a worse condition than before. His health suffered a\ngeneral decline, and he finally breathed his last on the 20th of\nJanuary 1875. He was buried in the little cemetery of Chailly, beside\nhis friend Rousseau, amidst the scenery they both loved so well.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE MAN AND HIS ART\n\n\nMillet is an instance of an artist working out his own destiny,\nimpelled by irresistible genius, in the teeth of seemingly\ninsurmountable obstacles. He started life with enormous disadvantages;\nwithout friends in influential circles to spread his fame or plead his\ncause; without money to enable him to outlive and triumph over the\nignorant fanaticism of critics and artists, so soaked in the\nconventionalised art of their time that they had not perception enough\nto appreciate the full meaning of that naturalistic movement, which\nwas finally to sweep away the quasi-classic art they boasted of with\nsuch bombastic effusion. The path was hard and thorny, and his triumph\nwas not finally consummated until after his death. He himself found\nhis only satisfaction in the fact that he had lived his life according\nto the dictates of his genius, and had achieved the maximum of which\nhe was capable.\n\nMillet and our own Cotman were somewhat kindred spirits; there is much\nmore affinity between the work of the two men than is apparent to any\none who has not closely studied them. The marvellous \"Breaking the\nClod,\" now happily permanently housed at the British Museum, betrays\nthe same tremendous conception and broad outlook which characterises\nmany a drawing of Millet's. Both highly strung to a painful extent,\nthey were each conscious of their inability to curb the power which\nprescribed a certain course for them, and in spite of pecuniary\ndifficulties and unpopularity, an inevitable result of their intense\noriginality, they pursued a steady course to the end of their lives.\n\nThe socialistic doctrines which have been read into the work of Millet\nare rather the outcome of the world's uneasy conscience being brought\nface to face with a crushing indictment of existing conditions, than\nof any design on the artist's part to further the cause of a political\npropaganda by means of his art. This somewhat extravagant reading into\nhis art has certainly been carried to excess. Particularly has such\nbeen the case in America, where a large number of his finest works are\nat present to be found, curiously enough in the hands of enormously\nwealthy people, who are frequently perhaps the least able to\nunderstand the real meaning of his message.\n\nComing from a peasant stock, his sympathies were always with the\npeasant; it was the only class he understood or cared for. He lived as\none of them, and shared to a large extent in their labour. He has been\ndesignated, not inappropriately, the philosopher in sabots. Rightly or\nwrongly he has come to be looked upon as one of the high priests of\ncommunistic doctrines. Few pictures have been so anathematised as the\n\"Man with the Hoe,\" and perhaps none have done more to inculcate\nsympathy with the degradation of the lower orders of the human race.\n\nThe revolting brutality and vacancy of that face haunts the\nimagination. Is it possible that fellow-creatures so utterly debased\nby toil and neglect exist? Millet dispels any doubt upon the question\nby bequeathing to humanity this trenchant portrait. By no means\nlimited to Barbizon or France, these poor creatures exist in every\ncountry, and curiously enough are considered an essential element in\neach country's development.\n\nThis poignantly human note is observable in almost every work Millet\nwrought; his passionate sympathy with his fellow-man is the keynote of\nhis art. The wood-cutter in his arduous toil, the shepherd in his\nsolitariness, the labourer turning the soil with unvarying and\nlaborious monotony, the mother caring for her children--all carry the\nsame message for him of that strange and incomprehensible mingling of\njoy and sadness we call life. Like many great minds before and since\nhis time, our artist found the greatest joy in life in a placid and\nnever changing melancholy. But the peasants he chose knew nothing of\nthe sadness he saw in them. Completely inured to their toil, and\nsubdued by it, with no refining or uplifting influence to stimulate\nthem, they knew nothing, aspired to nothing beyond what they were; it\nwas left to Millet to supply the \"might have been.\" He saw the inky\nblackness of the mind of the \"Man with the Hoe,\" the pathetic\ninequality between the mounted farmer directing the safe storage of\nhis crop, and the stooping figures of the \"Gleaners\" eager to scrape\nup the miserable crumbs which had fallen from the rich man's table. He\ntraced the lives of these simple folk until we arrive at the grim and\ngaunt figure of Death, who, as he grasps the woodman by the shoulder,\nreminds him that his course is finished and that he, in common with\nall his fellow-men, must enter the great unknown land from which there\nis no return. It is a sad and melancholy art, vibrating with purity\nand truth, the outpouring of a great soul yearning to express itself\nto the utmost of its power. The mind and character of the man can be\nread in every line and in every touch of the brush. His drawings and\netchings are even more searching in their virility than his pictures.\n\nThere is a spontaneousness about them we search for in vain in his\nwork in oil and pastel. In black and white his intensely emotional\nmind found a swift method of expression; in the laboriousness of oil\npainting he was fettered with the complications of the medium. It can\nbe fairly said that only in one or two paintings--a notable example\ncan be cited in the wondrous \"Sawyers\" at South Kensington--does he\nrise to the height of a great painter. Millet was a poet, a\nphilosopher, a great thinker, and the means he chose for expressing\nhimself were those which were best fitted to his purpose. His\npredilections in art were concentrated upon the greatest, and\nconsequently the men who appealed to him were the thinkers of the\nages. Mantegna and Correggio, Michel Angelo and the mighty Greeks,\nthese were the masters who left their impress upon his mind and art.\n\nThe influence of so sincere and profound an artist has necessarily\nbeen profound. He has moulded men who have achieved world-wide fame;\nSegantini, for example, would never have risen to the heights he did\nhad the example of Millet not been ever before him. There have been\nmany who, without possessing his genius, have endeavoured to follow\nin his footsteps, but successfully as his imitators have sometimes\ncaught his style, their productions can never live alongside his,\nbecause they lack the real ring of sincerity.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n        a. One bed, or folding cot,\n        b. One oil stove,\n        c. One lamp,\n        d. Enough supplies of all kinds sufficient for six months,\n        e. Pots, pans, kettles, etc.\nIt is needless to say that positions in Manila and Iloilo were now at\na premium.\n\nWas it possible that teachers were to be sent to places where even the\nnecessaries of life could not be obtained! Was it possible that many\nwould be sent to places so remote that for six months no fresh\nsupplies could be gotten! A mass meeting was held at once, and a\ncommittee was appointed to send a cablegram to the Associated Press\npetitioning aid from the American people at large. Realizing what\nconsternation would be created throughout the United States by such a\nmessage, two of the teachers leaped into a carriage at the close of\nthe meeting and a few moments later were closeted with the chief\nexecutive of the department. As a result the committee was persuaded\nnot to send the cablegram to the Associated Press until by courtesy it\nhad been sent to the President. Of course, this diplomatic move tided\naffairs over and the teachers who had flatly refused to budge from\nManila now agreed to go on to their stations, being assured that\nwhatever action was best would be taken.\n\nThe day had come when we must separate. We were to enter an untried\nand an unknown field. It was fitting that we have a final joyous\nmeeting, so the best orchestra in the archipelago was engaged and we\n\"chased the hours with flying feet\" until dawn so that whatever might\ncome to us in that unknown future upon which we were entering each\nwould hold in pleasant memory our last evening together.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER III. - A DRAMA IN ACTUAL LIFE.\n\n\nAlmost every one heeded the warning to go to his station forearmed\nwith at least necessaries of life, but, as it had never fallen to the\nlot of the writer to cook, he refused to learn at that late day, so he\ntook no pot, no pan, no kettle, putting his future into the hands of\nan uncertain fate and relying upon the unknown hospitality of the\nFilipino.\n\nBacalod, the capital of the province of Occidental Negros, was our\ndestination. The second morning after leaving Manila, we awoke with\nthe \"Kilpatrick\" lying at anchor in a shallow bay. We were several\nmiles from the shore and nothing in sight indicated that we had\nreached a place of any importance. Late the night before we had been\nawakened by the loud, sharp ringing of the ship's bells, accompanied\nby the reversal of the engines and a general disturbance awaking the\ncrew. So our first impressions on coming on deck were that we had run\naground. But the captain assured us that everything was ship-shape and\nthat this was the nearest point of approach to Capiz, a town of\nconsiderable importance on the island of Panay, where a body of troops\nwas to embark for home. Not even the grass hut of a native was in\nsight. Search as we would, not a sign was seen of a stream flowing\ninto the sea, indicating the probable presence of a town. There was\nnot a sign of life of any kind save one lone column of thin, blue\nsmoke that arose from the side of a mountain miles away. One would\nhave thought that we were explorers of three hundred years ago lying\noff the shore of some unknown land.\n\nAfter breakfast the steam launch, together with all the boats, was\nlowered, and several of us who had determined to miss no opportunity\nto gather information about the islands took our places in the launch\nby the side of the ship's mate, and steamed away across the water with\na long line of boats strung out in the rear. We headed away toward a\ngroup of cocoanut trees, and about an hour later stepped ashore on a\npile of decayed coral rocks that extended some twenty or thirty feet\nout into the water, thus forming the only landing place of a town of\nseveral thousands of people and of considerable commercial importance.\n\nA few moments after we had landed, an army wagon drawn by a\nmagnificent pair of mules came up out of a tropical jungle along a\nnarrow road. We clambered into the wagon and were soon lost in the\ndepths of foliage from which we had just seen the vehicle emerge.\n\nLong waving bamboos with their plumy leafage hung over the road from\neach side, meeting and overlapping in the center until they formed an\narchway so dense that the tropical sun now high in the heavens\npenetrated it only at intervals. At times the wagon sank up to the\nhubs in the soft earth, and the muscles of the mules stood out like\nwhip-cords under the skin as they drew us forward.\n\nAt a sharp turn in the road we came upon the first division of troops\nthat was to embark for home. The look of joy upon their sun-browned\nfaces was inexpressible. Their work was done, and with elastic step\nand smiling faces they saluted us as they passed by. The reign of\nforce was at an end; it was going out with them; the reign of peace\nhad begun; it was coming in with us.\n\nIn the afternoon when we returned from the town the last of the troops\nhad arrived and, as we drove up, the bugle was sounding the call to\nsupper. We noticed native women mingling with the troops and, indeed,\na native woman was in constant attention waiting upon one of the\nsoldiers with whom we ate. Her clothes were clean, her hair was nicely\ncombed, and her general appearance was neat. She seemed to anticipate\nthe slightest wish of the soldier with whom she was. She brought him\nwater to drink, cleaned his plate after the meal and saw that his\nknife, fork, and spoon were put into his haversack.\n\nWe had now finished supper and the launch had returned for the last\nload of troops. The lieutenant in command of the company gave the\norder to \"fall in\"; the men shouldered their rifles and fell into\nline. \"Forward, march!\" called the lieutenant, and the column swept\nforward towards the boats. The women had until now restrained\nthemselves, but, as their husbands marched away never to return, their\nfeelings could no longer be restrained. One young woman of about\neighteen, who was leaning against a rock by the roadside sobbing, when\nher husband passed, leaped up in frenzy of passionate love and caught\nthe rifle from his shoulder. Her first impulse seemed to be to throw\nthe gun away, but suddenly realizing the futility of such an act she\nburst into tears, shouldered the rifle herself and marched on by his\nside. Another woman of more mature age threw her arms around the legs\nof a tall stalwart man, and drew him bodily from the line.\n\nBut the troops marched on and entered the boats. One woman who had\nbeen unnoticed before came down into the shallow water and caught hold\nof our last boat as if to prevent its leaving, while others stood\nmingling their sobs with the sounds of the wavelets as they broke on\nthe sands. As we passed away, an expectant mother, standing in bold\noutline against the twilight sky, threw up her hands in an agony of\ndespair and then sank upon the stones. The curtain had fallen upon a\ndrama in actual life deeper in pathos than any other we had ever seen\nor ever expected to see. Depth of passion, depth of love! Who can\nfathom the human heart?\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. - WHAT THE TEACHERS DID.\n\n\nThere is a remarkable sameness about the towns in the Philippines.\n\nThey all have a large open square about the middle of the town, around\nthree sides of which are Chinese stores, unless one side lies open to\nthe sea, and on the fourth is the great stone ecclesia. The streets\nrun at right angles to one another and divide up the town into\ncreditable squares.\n\nEverybody in the Philippines lives up-stairs, for the ground is so\nsoaked with water during the rainy season that it is a menace to\nhealth to live upon the ground floor. So even the poorest nippa hut\nis built upon stakes four or five feet above the ground.\n\nBacalod is a typical Philippine town. As we landed, a broad open\nsquare was spread out before us. Two sides of the square were lined\nwith two-story houses in which were Chinese stores below and Filipino\nhomes above. On the third side stood the great stone church in whose\nmassive tower the clock was striking the hour of four, while the\nfourth lay open to the sea that had borne us thither.\n\nWe landed, but it was in a method new to us and one not usually\nemployed by the traveling public.\n\nWhen our sail boat ran aground on the sandy bottom a hundred yards or\nmore from the shore, a crowd of Filipino men who were on the beach\nslowly rolled up their pantaloons and waded out to the rescue,--for\nthe money that was in it. The boat's crew elevated their trousers'\nlegs also and slided down into the water. Each of us then straddled\nthe neck of a Filipino standing in the water and was held by ankles to\nbe steadied while our biped mounts proceeded to the shore.\n\nWe were now on the ground and face to face with the situation. To give\nthe reader an idea of the actual conditions met by the first teachers\nwho went to the Islands, the following is copied from the instructions\ngiven us in Manila:\n    1. There shall be two sessions daily of all schools, and the\n    last hour of the morning session shall be devoted solely to\n    instructing the Filipino teachers.\n\n    2. In cases where teachers are sent to a town in which there\n    is no school-house, they are expected to secure the aid of the\n    people and have one built.\n\n    3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is\n    stopped.\n\n    4. All supplies must be kept under lock and key. In towns\n    where there is no case or box to lock the supplies in, and it\n    is also impossible to get the town council to furnish a case,\n    a requisition may be sent to Manila, and, if an appropriation\n    can be secured, one will be made and sent out.\n\nThus it can be easily seen that we were indeed pioneers. In many\nplaces no school-house was to be found, and in some cases it was even\ndifficult to get the town council to provide a case in which to keep\nthe supplies.\n\nThe work of the teachers was, in short; to \"make the English language\nthe basis of instruction in the public schools.\" On our arrival at\nBacalod two schools were found in progress, for some soldiers had been\ndetailed for the work here previous to our coming. One of these was\nfor boys and the other, for girls. Thus the work here had been in a\nmeasure simplified, but complications that had arisen at Talisay, one\nof the largest and richest towns on the island, demanded a change of\nteachers and the writer was assigned to the place as superintendent.\n\nHere an attempt had been made to start a school but it had failed\nignominiously and a system of education was to be put into operation\nfrom the very start.\n\nThe Filipinos are not strong advocates of co-education, so separate\nschools were to be started for the boys and the girls. The one for the\nboys was gotten well in hand before the one for the girls was\nattempted at all.\n\nA few days after reaching the town and securing a home the\npresidente of the town had it publicly announced that the following\nMonday morning at eight o'clock a public school for boys would be\nopened in a building that had been rented for the purpose by the\nmunicipal council. About the middle of the afternoon of the same day a\nman beat a little drum throughout all the streets of the town to call\nthe people out and the town clerk announced both in Spanish and in the\nnative language that this public school would begin at the time and\nplace mentioned above; that instruction would be free to all who came;\nthat the government would furnish all supplies; and that instruction\nwould be given in the English language. A native principal and\nassistants were employed and everything was ready to begin.\n\nThe official report of the result is as follows:\n    Boys' public school of Talisay, Negros, P. I., began November\n    4, 1901. Forty-three boys present at eight o'clock. Forty-one\n    of them knew \"good morning\" and \"good afternoon\" but do not\n    know the distinction between them. Two of them speak simple\n    Spanish. At eight forty-five, eight more, who had been\n    attending an early morning private school, came in together.\n\n    The books they brought were so varied and so different from\n    one another that it seemed impossible to bring any reasonable\n    degree of order out of such a chaos, and so, after struggling\n    vainly for about a week with the problem, the superintendent\n    by one fell stroke removed everything in use and put in a\n    uniform system, and from that day on the English language has\n    been the basis of instruction in the public schools of\n    Talisay. The work was of necessity very slow at first, but by\n    the end of a year two schools were going nicely and a number\n    of the brightest boys and girls had made really excellent\n    progress.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER V. - A \"BAILE.\"\n\n\nNot long after the arrival of our party at Bacalod we received an\ninvitation to a \"baile\" given in our honor by the inhabitants of\nSilay, a town some ten or twelve miles up the northern coast and one\nnoted for its social life. The invitation was accepted with pleasure,\nand about the middle of the afternoon on the day appointed we were\nclad in the immaculate white of the tropics and steaming away up the\ncoast on board a launch sent for our conveyance. Twilight was still\nlingering on the path of day when we anchored just off shore at the\ntown. A row-boat containing the officials of the city came out to meet\nus and, in due season, we were ushered into a spacious drawing-room\nfilled almost to overflowing with the \u00e9lite of the town. The \u00e9lite of\ntowns in the Philippines speak Spanish, and, as only one or two of our\nparty could at that time boast of more than a formal acquaintance with\nthe Castilian tongue, the exchange of ideas that evening between us\nand the Filipinos was of necessity not very rapid.\n\nThe necessity of easy communication between us was rendered somewhat\nless indispensable by the announcement of supper as soon as we were\nrested from our trip. When we had taken our places at the table a\nyoung Filipino about twenty-five years of age arose and gave a lengthy\ntoast to the recent union of the Philippines with the United States.\n\nBut as we Americans were unable to scale the dizzy heights of his\nclimaxes or sink to the depths of his pathos, we forewent the\npleasures of his oratory and turned our attention to the savory odor\nof lamb, chicken, and roast pig that came slyly stealing up our\nnostrils to send us nerve dispatches about the gastronomic delights of\nour not far distant future.\n\nAt last the toast was ended and the world-wide soup ushered in a long\ntrain of things good to eat, served in a style better fitted to the\ndelights of the appetite than to the formalities of dinners, for, as\nsoon as the pleasant task of one dish was completed by any one, the\nnext was served him at once regardless of the progress made by the\nothers at the table.\n\nThe last course was dulce. The new-comers to the Philippines will\nnot be long in making the acquaintance of this dish, and at all\nmeetings, both public and private, where eatables are served, it\nperforms an important part. It is anything sweet, and it may vary all\nthe way from an india-rubber-like black mixture of cocoanut milk and\ndirty sugar to a really toothsome and respectable confection. No\nmatter of what materials a dish is composed, just so long as it is\nsweet, it is dulce.\n\nAfter paying our respects to this last course, we arose from the table\nand entered a great rectangular room from the center of whose ceiling\nhung a large glass chandelier, a mass of shimmering crystals. In the\nchairs around the room were the wealth, the youth, and the beauty of\nthe town.\n\nThe first and also the last number of every Filipino dance of any\nformality is the \"rigodon.\" The dancers are arranged in a square, or\nquadrangle according to the number participating, and are then led\nthrough a tangled maze of figures that so utterly bewilders the novice\nthat he sinks into his chair at the end of the dance wondering how it\nall came to pass.\n\nWe Americans breathed a sigh of relief when the \"rigodon\" ended, and\nmustered fresh courage for social conquests in the waltz that was now\nbreathing forth from the trembling strings. My companion in the first\ndance had been the young lady by whose side I had sat at dinner. But\nit now became necessary to search for another, so I prudently waited\nto see how partners were chosen, and made no mistake when a few\nmoments later I faced one of the most luscious looking se\u00f1oritas on\nthe opposite side of the room and offered her my arm. My eyes must\nhave told the story that my lips could not utter in Spanish, for she\nsmiled upon me sweetly, arose, and put her hand upon my shoulder. My\narm encircled her waist and I began to waltz. Unfortunately my\ncompanion did not follow, but began to hop up and down in a manner\nmost distressing. Supposing the attack to be only temporary, I paused\nand, much to my relief, she soon showed signs of recovery; and in the\ncourse of time she came to a standstill looking up into my face in an\ninquiring sort of way, apparently wondering why St. Vitus had not paid\nhis respects to me also. A second attempt to follow the music met with\nresults similar to the first, and during the third attempt, which\nseemed to be trembling on the verge of a failure, St. Vitus let go my\ncompanion and seized me with such vigor that she, who was small even\nfor a Filipino, was gathered up bodily and taken around the room at\nsuch a pace that her toes touched the floor only at far distant\nintervals.\n\nAt this point my devotion to the shrine of Terpsichore ceased from\nforce of circumstances and I seated myself in one of the most\ncomfortable chairs in sight that I might carry out a previously formed\nplan to study the Filipino somewhat critically as he appears in\nsociety.\n\nThe first thing that impressed me as the dancers passed up and down\nthe room was the flash of diamonds. Nearly every woman in the room had\non a brooch that flashed the colors of the rainbow at every turn.\n\nAlmost all of them wore one or more rings that showed up brilliantly\nunder the chandelier. Many of the men too, especially the young men,\nwore gems that appeared to be exquisite. A closer inspection showed\nthat some of the gems had flaws and others were of a poor color, but\nno one would have denied that, taken as a whole, it was a really\nbeautiful display.\n\nThe dress of the ladies was richly colored. Many of their skirts were\nof silk covered with hand embroidered flowers, and their filmy pina\nwaists and broad collar pieces were rich with needle-work. They all\nwore a kind of heelless velvet slipper, very common as a dress shoe in\nthe Philippines, or high-heeled patent leather shoes with neatly\nfitting black stockings.\n\nThe men were dressed in white coats and white pantaloons or black\ncoats and white pantaloons. White shirts and collars, together with\nall sorts and styles of cravats and low-cut patent leather shoes with\nhighly colored socks completed their dress.\n\nIt was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money;\nthat they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a\ntable loaded with good things was a fact to which all of us were\nenthusiastic witnesses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VI. - A SKETCH OF LIFE IN THE PHILIPPINES.\n\n\nHouse-keeping in the Philippines presents some interesting phases. Our\nclub of American officials decided to run a mess, so we employed a\ncook and a house boy, then each of us provided himself with a personal\nservant, making a total of six servants for four men--it takes about\nthis proportion of servants to live in any sort of comfort in the\nPhilippines--and launched ourselves boldly upon the sea of domestic\neconomy. But there were shoals ahead of us, for the question of\nregulating servants is one of no small importance in the Philippines,\nand one of its most disadvantageous features is the long chain of\ndependents that usually attends it.\n\nWe gave the cooks so much a day with which to buy supplies in the\nlocal market, for our own table, making him render a daily list of\nexpenditures, and a fixed amount besides to purchase rice and fish for\nhimself and the other servants. Of course, if they wished to vary\ntheir diet and get chicken and fresh pork, which could be had at far\ndistant intervals, it was wholly a matter of their option, but the\nallowance was made on the basis of so much rice and fish a day for\neach. This allowance was about fifteen cents a day in Spanish coin per\nservant.\n\nThus far all was well. We had agreed to give the cook eight dollars a\nmonth in Spanish money, thinking that good wages would procure good\nservice, but the visions of affluence that floated before him on such\nfloods of wealth were so alluring that they drew him from the kitchen\nto the cooler veranda. In less than a week he had employed an\nassistant at four dollars a month; in less than another week that\nassistant had employed him an assistant at two dollars a month; in\nless than another week that assistant to the assistant had employed\nhim an assistant at the princely salary of fifty cents a month; and\nfrom fear that the chain of dependents would end only by our having\nthe whole Filipino race attached to our culinary force, we broke up\nhouse-keeping and went boarding again, choosing that as the less of\nthe two evils.\n\nOur house furnishings were almost wholly Philippine. The table ware\nand the food on the table came from the ends of the earth. The knives\nand forks were made in Germany, the plates were manufactured in\nEngland, the glass ware and table cloth, in the United States. The\noatmeal and flour came from the United States also. The butter came\nfrom Australia, the rice from China, the salt from Russia, and the\nother eatables from sources about as various as their separate names.\n\nSwitzerland furnished the condensed milk and Illinois the canned\ncream. Nearly all of the canned fruit bore labels from Spain.\n\nThus it can easily be seen that life in the Philippines, if lived\naccording to American ideals, is dependent upon a highly developed and\nhighly complex commerce. However, the difficulties of transportation\nand the restriction of large stocks of merchandise to Manila and some\nhalf a dozen other towns, make so great a difference between country\nlife and city life that a short comparison of the two will not be out\nof place, and life in Manila may well be taken as being fairly typical\nof the latter.\n\nLife in Manila is pleasant, but expensive. It is pleasant from the\nfact that it is not only the capital but also metropolis of the\narchipelago. Thus the combination of wealth and high official position\nhas given to Manila a society of the highest and most refined type.\n\nThe process of beautifying and improving the city which is constantly\ngoing on bids fair to give us at no distant day a city of which we may\nwell be proud.\n\nBut let him who intends living well in Manila on a small income bid\nfarewell at once to so idylic a dream, for it costs much to live well\nthere. In the city of Manila one can get almost anything he wishes,\nbut it must be paid for at the price it commands. Especially in the\ncase of eatables, this price is by no means small, because to the\nfirst cost of articles must in most cases be added the expense of\ndistant shipment from American, European, or Australian ports, and not\ninfrequently the cost of long refrigeration must also be taken into\nconsideration. But, expensive though it is, it is very pleasant to\nlive there and those who have once enjoyed it often wish again to\nquaff the cup of its delights.\n\nIn strong contrast to this pleasant life is the life of the quiet\nlittle hamlet away in the distant islands. Indeed, the Filipino from\nthe distant town, who by some good fortune has been to Manila, or, by\na coup de main, has studied in one of the Manila colleges, is looked\nup to in a true hero-worshiping attitude by all who either know him or\nhear of his fame. Life in such a place is one long state of harmless\ninactivity. Not a wave of trouble from the great outer world ever\ndisturbs its peaceful repose. One lounges forever in an air of\nindolent ease and extreme aversion to anything approaching what might\nbe called a respectable effort.\n\nOne arises in the morning about the time the sun's first rays silver\nthe top leaves of the cocoanut trees and then stirs around until nine\nor ten o'clock, when it is found expedient to avoid a further exposure\nto the sun. From then until about five o'clock in the afternoon it is\nbest to take things as they come, even though one of those things be a\nFilipino dinner. But then you may have your vehiclo attached to a\nyoung bull with a ring in his nose and go for a drive. If it is the\ndry season you will probably enjoy the drive unless you object to the\nfrequent clouds of dust swept along by the evening wind. If it is in\nthe rainy season your pleasure will depend to a considerable extent\nupon how wet you get; but, whether the season be wet or dry, your\npleasure will be regulated largely by the state of harmony existing\nbetween the driver and the bull.\n\nIn these quiet secluded nooks successive generations of Filipinos are\nborn, reared, grow old and die in an even chain of events broken only\nby the occasional erection of a new grass house on the identical spot\nwhere its predecessors have stood for ages. The son lives in the house\nof his father, cultivates the same few square feet of soil planted in\nedible roots, climbs the same cocoanut trees, follows the same winding\npath down to the stream, pounds rice in the same mortar and with the\nsame stick that his ancestors have used from time unremembered, and,\nin case of illness, curls up on a grass mat in a corner of the room\nuntil he dies or by some good fortune recovers. Beyond this narrow\nhorizon he never looks. So narrow and contracted is the life that the\nlanguages of two towns a few miles apart are so different that one\nwould scarcely recognize them as belonging to the same race of people.\n\nSuch are the two extremes of life in our new far Eastern provinces:\nthe one is active, progressive, and cosmopolitan; the other, inactive,\ndecadent, and narrow; but, whether one enjoys the first or endures the\nsecond, there comes to him after leaving a longing to lounge again in\ntropic airs and listen to the lullaby of the winds among the palms.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VII. - THE FILIPINO AT HOME.\n\n\nAs one enters a Filipino sitting-room for the first time, there is one\nfeature in the arrangement of the furniture that impresses itself upon\nhim at once, and it may be stated without fear of serious\ncontradiction that this same peculiar feature in its arrangement will\ncontinue to face him, as he enters different homes, about as certainly\nas he crosses the threshold.\n\nThe arrangement referred to is that of one large mirror, one settee,\nand some ten or a dozen chairs that appear to have had a certain\norderly affection for one another. The mirror is hung upon one of the\nlarge interior parts of the house about four feet above the floor. The\nwooden houses in the Philippines are built by setting large posts\nupright into the ground, extending into the air from twenty to thirty\nfeet. Cross timbers are fastened to these upright posts about eight or\nten feet above the ground and then not sawed off even with the posts,\nbut allowed to extend beyond them each way. The framework of the house\nis built upon these extending cross timbers, a style of building by\nwhich these large upright posts are left standing out on the inside of\nthe room from one to three feet from the walls. It is on that one of\nthese posts most nearly opposite the door that the mirror always finds\nits place. Immediately beneath the mirror is the settee; and the\nchairs are arranged in two parallel lines facing one another and at\nright angles with the ends of the settee. However odd this arrangement\nmay appear to one when he first enters a Filipino drawing-room, there\nare two things to be said in its favor. In the first place, it places\nyou face to face with the person with whom you are conversing so that\nyou can watch him,--a matter of no small moment in the Philippines. In\nthe next place, it enables you to give one of the young ladies a\nsheep's-eye in the mirror while the others present are left where\nMoses was in our much abused conundrum.\n\nThe size of the residence and the quality of its furnishings depends\nupon the wealth of the owner. But there is so vast a difference\nbetween the mode of life of the highest class and the tao, or lowest\nclass, that it is well to speak of them separately, and the great\nmiddle class of Filipinos can easily be imagined to occupy the\nintervening ground.\n\nThe rich Filipino's house is usually of wood built upon a wall of\nstone or brick from ten to fifteen feet high. The floors are kept\nhighly polished in his hallway, dressing-room, and bed-rooms. There\nare, of course, no fire-places in any of the rooms, but on some\noccasions something is needed to dry the rain-soaked atmosphere, for\neven in the dry season it has been seen to rain for five successive\ndays and nights without the cessation of a moment.\n\nA long chain of dependents is attached to the household of the rich\nFilipino. The master has his special body servant to be present at all\ntimes to do his master's bidding, in short, to be the visible\nmechanism of his master's volition. So, too, the lady of the house has\nher servant woman to do the slightest bidding of her ladyship. Then\nthere is the cook who is almost invariably a man, a house boy or two,\nand the coachman. These functionaries, with their assistants and\nassistants to the assistants, together with a servant or two for the\nexclusive service of the children, complete the economic household.\n\nSuch a family has an abundance of rice and wheat bread, also of\nchicken and fish with occasional fresh beef. They have also a good\ndeal of dulce. They regularly serve wine and frequently serve beer\non their tables.\n\nIn strong contrast with this mode of life is that of the tao. His\ndiet consists almost wholly of rice and small uncleaned fish boiled\ntogether. As a rule knife, fork, plate, and spoon find no place in his\nhousehold. The rice and fish are boiled in a pot and then allowed to\ncool in the same vessel or poured out to cool in a large earthen or\nwooden bowl. Then Mr. Tao together with Mrs. Tao and all the young\nTaos squat on their heels around the mixture and satisfy that\nintangible thing called the appetite. They do not use chop sticks as\nthe Chinese do, but the rice and fish are caught in a hollow formed by\nthe first three fingers of the right hand. The thumb is then placed\nbehind the mass. It is raised up and poised before the mouth, with a\nskill coming from the evolution of ages, when a contraction of the\nmuscles of the thumb throws the mass into the mouth with a skill that\nis marvelous to any but a Filipino. To judge from the most reliable\ninformation, the poorest class do not have an abundance of food,\nalthough it would seem that such a condition of things would be\nwell-nigh impossible. However, in a census of one hundred school\nchildren there were found six boys and four girls who declared that\nthey had never had enough to eat, and the native teacher stated that\nthis was probably true.\n\nThe wide gulf between the tao and the rich man is filled by the\ngreat middle class of Filipinos.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VIII. - VISIT TO A LEPER COLONY.\n\n\nNot far from our town was a leper colony and the first Saturday that\ncould be spared was set aside for a trip to the place. It happened\nthat none of the other Americans were at leisure on this particular\nmorning, but, rather then delay the trip or miss it altogether, the\nwriter, armed with a revolver, started out alone.\n\nThe road had been described so accurately by one who was supposed to\nknow it that it was deemed well-nigh impossible to miss the way. The\nmain highway was followed to the point where the by-path supposed to\nlead to the settlement turned off through some bamboo thickets and a\nlow tropical wood. This path led straight away towards the sea-coast\nwhere the houses of the colony were said to stand in a cocoanut grove\nby the beach.\n\nUpon arriving at the settlement, a very inhospitable reception was\nreceived from a mangy cur that growled and showed a very uninviting\nset of sharp, white teeth behind his snarling lips. The growling of\nthe dog had attracted the attention of an old man who, with age-bent\nback, was pounding rice in a mortar about fifty yards away. He turned\nslowly around and, upon seeing an intruder into the primitive quiet of\nthe place, gave a sharp, far-reaching call. The sound had scarcely\nrung through the grove when from about a dozen of the little grass\nhouses dotted here and there fifteen or twenty men armed with bolos\ncame out and gathered around the old man. A sense of my danger flashed\nupon me. Three miles from town and alone in a tropical jungle, I could\nbe almost instantly overcome by this band of bolo-men, and the only\nreport that would ever reach my people would be that I had\n\"disappeared.\" Of course, attack was by no means certain, but the\npotentiality of the situation was thrilling. A drawn revolver and the\ngleaming of its shining barrel had the effect of stopping the men, who\nseemed to be hesitating as to a course of action, until a somewhat\ndignified retreat was made to an open space in the rear from where a\nless dignified and a more hasty retreat began which did not stop short\nof Bacalod.\n\nEnough had been seen, however, even in this short visit, to give\nconvincing proof that the settlement visited was no colony of lepers;\nso, that afternoon two servant boys being taken as guides and\ninterpreters, another attempt was made to reach the goal desired.\n\nThis attempt was successful, and, after about two hours of walking, a\nlittle cluster of grass huts snugly hidden by the sea-coast came into\nview. As we approached, one would have thought it a gala-day. Some few\nchildren, apparently from six to thirteen years of age, almost wholly\nnude, were romping and playing in the open space around which the huts\nstood, and no one would ever have thought that any cloud so horrible\nas leprosy could hover over a place apparently so happy.\n\nBy the side of the path as we passed was a man and his wife setting\nout potato plants. His hands were so puffed and his fingers so short\nthat he could scarcely use them, but he was working along as best he\ncould. His wife's feet were so swollen and twisted that she walked\nonly with the greatest difficulty. We passed them by and entered the\nopen space above referred to.\n\nThe children now saw us, and those of them who could darted away like\nfrightened rabbits, each to his own burrow. An old man who was sitting\nin the warm afternoon sun on the little bamboo platform before his hut\nwas aroused from his lethargic repose by the scampering away of the\nchildren. He arose, trembling upon his tottering limbs, all drawn and\ntwisted, and hobbled away into his hut.\n\nThe children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at\nthe doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of\nthe settlement. In a few moments we were surrounded by a circle of\nhuman beings at once so repulsive and so pitiable that its graphic\nvividness can never be accurately portrayed.\n\nThe old man referred to above, having put on a pair of snow-white\npantaloons, appeared now at the doorway of his hut, followed a few\nmoments later by his wife who had evidently clothed herself in the\nbest raiment she had. At a call from the old man, all the men, women,\nand children in the settlement came out of their huts and stood in a\nline before us. The old man was spokesman and in his native visayan\ntongue made a heart-rending appeal for aid which we were powerless to\ngive. Attention was called to a leper woman, apparently about\ntwenty-five years of age, whose face had been attacked by the disease\nand whose appearance was truly pathetic. Upon her hip was a child\nabout a year and a half old and, strange to say, the child showed as\nyet no signs whatever of the disease.\n\nWhat an indissoluble enigma is life! Here in a little cluster of grass\nhuts in a secluded nook of a secluded island of an all but secluded\narchipelago was gathered together a little community of wretched\nnatives, driven by their loathsomeness from association with others\neven of the same half-savage race. Yet here, men and women loved and\nwere married, by mutual trust if not by law, and children were born of\nthe union to live forever under the unspeakable horror that\novershadowed the unfortunate parents. Love, hatred, sorrow, and\njoy--every passion that enters into the complex structure of the human\nheart even here, in this scene of sadness and despair, was playing\napparently as freely as where misfortune and disease had never crossed\nthe portals of life.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER IX. - A \"HIKE.\"\n\n\nWe were lounging lazily in our hammocks at Jimamaylan one evening in\nApril. Supper was just ended, and the soldiers in the post were\ncollected in groups here and there spinning yarns to pass away the\ntime, when a Filipino clad only in a loin cloth came down the street\nat a steadily swinging run and stopped in front of the sentry. He\nbrought the announcement that a band of ladrones had just burned a\nsugar mill and were advancing to sack a barrio about fifteen miles\naway.\n\nThe invitation of the commanding officer to go on a \"hike\" was eagerly\naccepted, and, in ten minutes after the message was given, the troops\nwere on the march followed by two adventurous pedagogues.\n\nDarkness was just closing in as we left the town, but a resplendent\ntropic moon soon made the night almost as brilliant as the day. The\ntrail we followed led over rough and rocky country. Sometimes for a\ndistance of a mile or more we passed over barren wastes of volcanic\nslag poured out in anger by some peak whose convulsions have long\nsince ceased. Again we would descend into a tropical jungle from the\ndense foliage of which the ladrones could have leaped at any moment,\nhad they known of our coming, and annihilated our little band. We\nforded rapid streams with the water at our breasts, and halted only\nonce in that rapid march of fifteen miles.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the town we met a man who was standing\nguard against a surprise by the ladrones. Nothing could well have been\nmuch more grotesque and nothing could much better illustrate the\nabsolutely primitive condition of the Filipinos in the interior of the\nislands than the appearance of this guard. A pair of knee pants, a\nconical grass hat, and a hemp shirt formed his entire apparel. A long\nflat wooden shield, a bolo, and a long bamboo spear with a sharp,\nflat, iron point, completed his equipment for battle.\n\nHere stood the first and the twentieth centuries side by side. The\nFilipino who had advanced only a stage beyond the condition of\nprimitive man with his knife, spear, and wooden shield, stood side by\nside with the American soldier, a representative of modern life with\nhis magazine rifle, his canteen, his knapsack,--with every article of\nhis clothing made to give him the highest possible efficiency as the\nunit of a military organization.\n\nA few yards farther on we met another guard equipped similarly to the\nfirst. Upon reaching the town, news had just been received that a\ndetachment of troops from another post had intercepted the ladrones\nand fought a skirmish with them. The ladrones had escaped and we set\nout in pursuit of them on a chase wilder than a Quixotic dream. We\nwound our way into the mountains behind the town, inquiring at every\ngrass hut we passed whether the band of ladrones had passed that way,\nbut only once was even a trace of them found. Then it was learned that\nat a certain place they had separated into groups of three or four and\ngone glimmering through the dream of things that were. This place was\nin a secluded nook of the mountains where in years gone by some\nadventurous Spaniard had erected a primitive water mill to grind his\nsugar-cane. We had now marched about twenty miles and the feet of the\npedagogues were a mass of blisters. They had reached the point where\nthat form of military maneuvering called \"hiking\" ceased to possess\nany alluring charms. So a native was persuaded to come out of his lone\nmountain hut and hitch up his carabao and cart. He was then made to\nget on the carabao's back, while the aforesaid pedagogues lay down on\nthe sugar-cane pulp that had been put into the body of the cart, and\nthe driver was instructed to start for the post we had left hours\nbefore, and not to stop until he got there. Being uncertain but that\nsome of the ladrones would learn of our having left the body of troops\nand would try the metal of our steel, we at first agreed that neither\nof us should go to sleep, but it was later decided that probably the\ndriver had no greater desire to cross the Styx than his passengers had\nand that in case of danger he would awaken us, so both took a revolver\nin each hand, stretched out supinely and went to sleep.\n\nSuch a sleep! The rough jolting of the cart over an almost impassable\nroad was never enough to break the spell of slumber. When we awoke the\nblazing tropic sun was past the midday mark of morning, shining full\ninto our unprotected and well-nigh blistered faces.\n\nA pack of dogs were heralding our approach to a little village at the\nfoot of the mountains where ponies were procured to take us back to\nthe post."

                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently\nno time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth dimension of Space\nas a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house\nbecame quite quiet.\n\nOn reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up\nagainst a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realize\nhis position. Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\nhundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the\nDowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone\ninto hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains on\none of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who\nhad been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr\nto nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair\nby the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six\nweeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become\nreconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that\nnotorious sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible\nnight when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his\ndressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and\nconfessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox\nout of \u00a350,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card, and swore that\nthe ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back\nto him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because\nhe had seen a green hand tapping at the window-pane, to the beautiful\nLady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round\nher throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin,\nand who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of the\nKing's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he went\nover his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as\nhe recalled to mind his last appearance as \"Red Reuben, or the Strangled\nBabe,\" his d\u00e9but as \"Guant Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,\"\n\nand the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely\nplaying ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And\nafter all this some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him\nthe Rising Sun Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite\nunbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever been treated in this\nmanner. Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance, and remained till\ndaylight in an attitude of deep thought.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III\n\n\nThe next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed\nthe ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. \"I have\nno wish,\" he said, \"to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say\nthat, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,\"--a very just remark,\nat which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.\n\n\"Upon the other hand,\" he continued, \"if he really declines to use the\nRising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him. It\nwould be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside\nthe bedrooms.\"\n\nFor the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the\nblood-stain on the library floor. This certainly was very strange, as\nthe door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept\nclosely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a\ngood deal of comment. Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red,\nthen it would be vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came\ndown for family prayers, according to the simple rites of the Free\nAmerican Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright\nemerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party\nvery much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening. The\nonly person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia, who,\nfor some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the\nsight of the blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was\nemerald-green.\n\nThe second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in\nthe hall. Rushing down-stairs, they found that a large suit of old\narmour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone\nfloor, while seated in a high-backed chair was the Canterville ghost,\nrubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face. The\ntwins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged\ntwo pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained\nby long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United\nStates Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in\naccordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost\nstarted up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a\nmist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so\nleaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase\nhe recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of\ndemoniac laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely\nuseful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single\nnight, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French\ngovernesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly\nlaughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and\nrang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door\nopened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown. \"I am\nafraid you are far from well,\" she said, \"and have brought you a bottle\nof Doctor Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a\nmost excellent remedy.\" The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at\nonce to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an\naccomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family\ndoctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's\nuncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps,\nhowever, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself\nwith becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep\nchurchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.\n\nOn reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the\nmost violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross\nmaterialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what\nreally distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit\nof mail. He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by\nthe sight of a Spectre in armour, if for no more sensible reason, at\nleast out of respect for their natural poet Longfellow, over whose\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\nhour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides it was his own suit.\n\nHe had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament, and had\nbeen highly complimented on it by no less a person than the Virgin Queen\nherself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely overpowered\nby the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen\nheavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees severely, and\nbruising the knuckles of his right hand.\n\nFor some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of\nhis room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.\n\nHowever, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to\nmake a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his\nfamily. He selected Friday, August 17th, for his appearance, and spent\nmost of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in\nfavour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet\nfrilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards evening a\nviolent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was\njust such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to\nmake his way quietly to Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the\nfoot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\nof low music. He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville\nblood-stain by means of Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent. Having reduced\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and\nhis wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead,\nwhile he hissed into her trembling husband's ear the awful secrets of\nthe charnel-house. With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made\nup his mind. She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and\ngentle. A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more\nthan sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the\ncounterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins, he was quite\ndetermined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be done was, of\ncourse, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling\nsensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each\nother, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse,\ntill they became paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw off the\nwinding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white, bleached bones and\none rolling eyeball, in the character of \"Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's\nSkeleton,\" a r\u00f4le in which he had on more than one occasion produced a\ngreat effect, and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of\n\"Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.\"\n\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the\nlight-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves\nbefore they retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still,\nand, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the\nwindow-panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family\nslept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\ncould hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States. He\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his\nmurdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like\nan evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.\n\nOnce he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only\nthe baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange\nsixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\nin the midnight air. Finally he reached the corner of the passage that\nled to luckless Washington's room. For a moment he paused there, the\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's\nshroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was\ncome. He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had\nhe done so than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid\nhis blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was\nstanding a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous\nas a madman's dream! Its head was bald and burnished; its face round,\nand fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\nfeatures into an eternal grin. From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\nlight, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like\nto his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form. On its breast\nwas a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of\nshame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime,\nand, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\n\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's\njack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler. Once in the\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small\npallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes. After a time, however,\nthe brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to\ngo and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight. Accordingly,\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling\nthat, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid\nof his new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins. On reaching\nthe spot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had\nevidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from\nits hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it\nwas leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable\nattitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his\nhorror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a\nrecumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity\nbed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow\nturnip lying at his feet! Unable to understand this curious\ntransformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there,\nin the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:--\n        +------------------------------------+\n        |         YE OTIS GHOSTE             |\n        | Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook, |\n        |    Beware of Ye Imitationes.       |\n        |   All others are counterfeite.     |\n        +------------------------------------+\nThe whole thing flashed across him. He had been tricked, foiled, and\nout-witted! The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his\ntoothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his\nhead, swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\nschool, that, when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds\nof blood would be wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.\n\nHardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of\na distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh,\nand waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\nreason, did not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back\nto his room, thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose. There he\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was\nexceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which this oath\nhad been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second time. \"Perdition\nseize the naughty fowl,\" he muttered, \"I have seen the day when, with my\nstout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow\nfor me an 'twere in death!\" He then retired to a comfortable lead\ncoffin, and stayed there till evening.\n\n\nCHAPTER: IV\n\n\nThe next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were\ncompletely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five\ndays he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point\nof the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want\nit, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a\nlow, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating\nthe symbolic value of sensuous phenomena. The question of phantasmic\napparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a\ndifferent matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large\noriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every month, and he\ndid not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is\nquite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand,\nhe was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.\n\nFor the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as\nusual between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible\nprecaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots,\ntrod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large\nblack velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for\noiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good\ndeal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of\nprotection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he\nslipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a\nlittle humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see\nthat there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a\ncertain degree, it served his purpose. Still in spite of everything he\nwas not left unmolested. Strings were continually being stretched across\nthe corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion,\nwhile dressed for the part of \"Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley\nWoods,\" he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide,\nwhich the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry\nChamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged\nhim, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and\nsocial position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the\nnext night in his celebrated character of \"Reckless Rupert, or the\nHeadless Earl.\"\n\nHe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in\nfact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means\nof it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord\nCanterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome\nJack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\ndown the terrace at twilight. Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\nLord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken\nheart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it\nhad been a great success. It was, however an extremely difficult\n\"make-up,\" if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more\nscientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three\nhours to make his preparations. At last everything was ready, and he was\nvery pleased with his appearance. The big leather riding-boots that went\nwith the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\nfind one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite\nsatisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting\nand crept down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins,\nwhich I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of\nthe colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make\nan effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water\nfell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his\nleft shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed. The shock to his\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\ncould go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold. The only\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\nhad not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences\nmight have been very serious.\n\nHe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,\nand contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in\nlist slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\ndraughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the\ntwins. The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September. He\nhad gone down-stairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that\nthere, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing\nhimself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of\nthe United States Minister and his wife which had now taken the place of\nthe Canterville family pictures. He was simply but neatly clad in a long\nshroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip\nof yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In\nfact, he was dressed for the character of \"Jonas the Graveless, or the\nCorpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,\" one of his most remarkable\nimpersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to\nremember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their\nneighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a quarter-past two o'clock in\nthe morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring. As\nhe was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any\ntraces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a\ndark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads,\nand shrieked out \"BOO!\" in his ear.\n\nSeized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural,\nhe rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him\nthere with the big garden-syringe, and being thus hemmed in by his\nenemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the\ngreat iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to\nmake his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own\nroom in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.\n\nAfter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins\nlay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\nservants, but it was of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings\nwere so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed\nhis great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had\nbeen engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized a wonderful\nclam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse\neuchre, poker, and other American national games, and Virginia rode\nabout the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire,\nwho had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville\nChase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in\nfact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who,\nin reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best\ncongratulations to the Minister's worthy wife.\n\nThe Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the\nhouse, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let\nmatters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the\nyoung Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had\nonce bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice\nwith the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the\nfloor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state that, though\nhe lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but\n\"Double Sixes.\" The story was well known at the time, though, of course,\nout of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt\nwas made to hush it up, and a full account of all the circumstances\nconnected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle's\nRecollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends. The ghost, then,\nwas naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence\nover the Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his\nown first cousin having been married en secondes noces to the Sieur de\nBulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are\nlineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to\nVirginia's little lover in his celebrated impersonation of \"The Vampire\nMonk, or the Bloodless Benedictine,\" a performance so horrible that when\nold Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in\nthe year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which\nculminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after\ndisinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and\nleaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment,\nhowever, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the\nlittle Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal\nBedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.\n\n\nCHAPTER: V\n\n\nA few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out\nriding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting\nthrough a hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go\nup by the back staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past\nthe Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied\nshe saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother's maid, who\nsometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend\nher habit. To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville\nGhost himself! He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of\nthe yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing\nmadly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his hand, and his\nwhole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so forlorn, and so\nmuch out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea\nhad been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity,\nand determined to try and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so\ndeep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she\nspoke to him.\n\n\"I am so sorry for you,\" she said, \"but my brothers are going back to\nEton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy\nyou.\"\n\n\"It is absurd asking me to behave myself,\" he answered, looking round in\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,\n\"quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and\nwalk about at night, if that is what you mean. It is my only reason for\nexisting.\"\n\n\"It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very\nwicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had\nkilled your wife.\"\n\n\"Well, I quite admit it,\" said the Ghost, petulantly, \"but it was a\npurely family matter, and concerned no one else.\"\n\n\"It is very wrong to kill any one,\" said Virginia, who at times had a\nsweet puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.\n\n\"Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very\nplain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about\ncookery. Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent\npricket, and do you know how she had it sent to table? However, it is\nno matter now, for it is all over, and I don't think it was very nice of\nher brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.\"\n\n\"Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost--I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry? I\nhave a sandwich in my case. Would you like it?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you,\nall the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\nvulgar, dishonest family.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Virginia, stamping her foot, \"it is you who are rude, and\nhorrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the\npaints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain\nin the library. First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and\nI couldn't do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the\nchrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese\nwhite, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing\nto look at, and not at all easy to paint. I never told on you, though I\nwas very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for\nwho ever heard of emerald-green blood?\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" said the Ghost, rather meekly, \"what was I to do? It is\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother\nbegan it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I\nshould not have your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of\ntaste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest\nin England; but I know you Americans don't care for things of this\nkind.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\nand improve your mind. My father will be only too happy to give you a\nfree passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind,\nthere will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are\nall Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\nhave a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family ghost.\"\n\n\"I don't think I should like America.\"\n\n\"I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,\" said Virginia,\nsatirically.\n\n\"No ruins! no curiosities!\" answered the Ghost; \"you have your navy and\nyour manners.\"\n\n\"Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week's\nholiday.\"\n\n\"Please don't go, Miss Virginia,\" he cried; \"I am so lonely and so\nunhappy, and I really don't know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I\ncannot.\"\n\n\"That's quite absurd! You have merely to go to bed and blow out the\ncandle. It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\nchurch, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why, even\nbabies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.\"\n\n\"I have not slept for three hundred years,\" he said sadly, and\nVirginia's beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; \"for three hundred\nyears I have not slept, and I am so tired.\"\n\nVirginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like\nrose-leaves. She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked\nup into his old withered face.\n\n\"Poor, poor Ghost,\" she murmured; \"have you no place where you can\nsleep?\"\n\n\"Far away beyond the pine-woods,\" he answered, in a low, dreamy voice,\n\"there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\nsings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold crystal\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\nsleepers.\"\n\nVirginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\n\n\"You mean the Garden of Death,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth,\nwith the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have\nno yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at\npeace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of death's\nhouse, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death\nis.\"\n\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\nthere was silence. She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\n\nThen the ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of\nthe wind.\n\n\"Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?\"\n\n\"Oh, often,\" cried the little girl, looking up; \"I know it quite well.\n\nIt is painted in curious black letters, and is difficult to read. There\nare only six lines:\n    \"'When a golden girl can win\n    Prayer from out the lips of sin,\n    When the barren almond bears,\n    And a little child gives away its tears,\n    Then shall all the house be still\n    And peace come to Canterville.'\n\n\"But I don't know what they mean.\"\n\n\"They mean,\" he said, sadly, \"that you must weep with me for my sins,\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle,\nthe angel of death will have mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\ncannot prevail.\"\n\nVirginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair\nas he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes. \"I am not afraid,\" she said\nfirmly, \"and I will ask the angel to have mercy on you.\"\n\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as\nhe led her across the dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were\nbroidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back. \"Go back! little Virginia,\"\n\nthey cried, \"go back!\" but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly,\nand she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails\nand goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and\nmurmured, \"Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,\"\n\nbut the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When\nthey reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she\ncould not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly\nfading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A\nbitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her\ndress. \"Quick, quick,\" cried the Ghost, \"or it will be too late,\" and\nin a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry\nChamber was empty.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VI\n\n\nAbout ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not\ncome down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia\nanywhere. As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\nevening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all\nalarmed at first, but when six o'clock struck, and Virginia did not\nappear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for\nher, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house. At\nhalf-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\nof their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of\nexcitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly\nremembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies\npermission to camp in the park. He accordingly at once set off for\nBlackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son\nand two of the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire, who was\nperfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too,\nbut Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a\nscuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gipsies had\ngone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as\nthe fire was still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.\n\nHaving sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran\nhome, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the\ncounty, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been\nkidnapped by tramps or gipsies. He then ordered his horse to be brought\nround, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down\nto dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with a groom. He had hardly,\nhowever, gone a couple of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after\nhim, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with\nhis face very flushed, and no hat. \"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,\" gasped\nout the boy, \"but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.\n\nPlease don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year,\nthere would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me back,\nwill you? I can't go! I won't go!\"\n\nThe Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace,\nand was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down\nfrom his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, \"Well,\nCecil, if you won't go back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must\nget you a hat at Ascot.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!\" cried the little Duke, laughing,\nand they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of\nthe station-master if any one answering to the description of Virginia\nhad been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her. The\nstation-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him\nthat a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a\nhat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his\nshutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away,\nwhich he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as there was a\nlarge common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman, but\ncould get no information from him, and, after riding all over the\ncommon, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase\nabout eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found\nWashington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with\nlanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest trace of\nVirginia had been discovered. The gipsies had been caught on Brockley\nmeadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they should be late. Indeed, they had\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's disappearance, as they\nwere very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his\npark, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search.\n\nThe carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone\nover, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any\nrate, Virginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest\ndepression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they\nfound a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\nwas poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and\nhaving her forehead bathed with eau de cologne by the old housekeeper.\n\nMr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up\nsupper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one\nspoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very\nfond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the\nentreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that\nnothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in\nthe morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down\nimmediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight\nbegan to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded\nthey heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder\nshook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a\npanel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out\non the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her\nhand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs.\nOtis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with\nviolent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.\n\n\"Good heavens! child, where have you been?\" said Mr. Otis, rather\nangrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them.\n\n\"Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and\nyour mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these\npractical jokes any more.\"\n\n\"Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!\" shrieked the twins, as they\ncapered about.\n\n\"My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side\nagain,\" murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair.\n\n\"Papa,\" said Virginia, quietly, \"I have been with the Ghost. He is dead,\nand you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was\nreally sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of\nbeautiful jewels before he died.\"\n\nThe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave\nand serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a\nlighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they\ncame to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia\ntouched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves\nin a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated\nwindow. Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was\na gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone\nfloor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers\nan old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its\nreach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was\ncovered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but\na pile of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding\nher little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the\nparty looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\ndisclosed to them.\n\n\"Hallo!\" suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out\nof the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\nsituated. \"Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.\"\n\n\"God has forgiven him,\" said Virginia, gravely, as she rose to her feet,\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.\n\n\"What an angel you are!\" cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round\nher neck, and kissed her.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VII\n\n\nFour days after these curious incidents, a funeral started from\nCanterville Chase at about eleven o'clock at night. The hearse was drawn\nby eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\nnodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\npurple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville\ncoat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\nservants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully\nimpressive. Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up\nspecially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first\ncarriage along with little Virginia. Then came the United States\nMinister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the\nlast carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had\nbeen frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she\nhad a right to see the last of him. A deep grave had been dug in the\ncorner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service\nwas read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, the servants, according to an old custom\nobserved in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as\nthe coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward,\nand laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms. As\nshe did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its\nsilent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a\nnightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of the\nGarden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a\nword during the drive home.\n\nThe next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given\nto Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby\nnecklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen\nof sixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis\nfelt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"I know that in this country mortmain is held to\napply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that\nthese jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg\nyou, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you\nunder certain strange conditions. As for my daughter, she is merely a\nchild, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such\nappurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I\nmay say, is no mean authority upon Art,--having had the privilege of\nspending several winters in Boston when she was a girl,--that these gems\nare of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\nprice. Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you\nwill recognize how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\nin the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such\nvain gauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\nBritish aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who\nhave been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles\nof Republican simplicity. Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box, as a memento of\nyour unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is extremely old, and\nconsequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to\ncomply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good deal\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with medi\u00e6valism\nin any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was\nborn in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned\nfrom a trip to Athens.\"\n\nLord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister's speech,\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile,\nand when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\nsaid: \"My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky\nancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are\nmuch indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck. The jewels\nare clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough\nto take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave\nin a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. As for their being\nheirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or\nlegal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite\nunknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and\nwhen Miss Virginia grows up, I dare say she will be pleased to have\npretty things to wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the\nfurniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to\nthe ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity\nSir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he\nwas really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase.\"\n\nMr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville's refusal, and\nbegged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was\nquite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to\nretain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of\n1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's first\ndrawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the\nuniversal theme of admiration. For Virginia received the coronet, which\nis the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her\nboy-lover as soon as he came of age. They were both so charming, and\nthey loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the\nmatch, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch\nthe Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less\nthan three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to\nsay, Mr. Otis himself. Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke\npersonally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his\nown words, \"was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating\ninfluences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of\nRepublican simplicity should be forgotten.\" His objections, however,\nwere completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the\naisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his\narm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of\nEngland.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to\nCanterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over\nin the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods. There had\nbeen a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir\nSimon's tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it\nsimply the initials of the old gentleman's name, and the verse from the\nlibrary window. The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses,\nwhich she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for\nsome time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There\nthe Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her\nfeet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly\nhe threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her,\n\"Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.\"\n\n\"Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have,\" he answered, smiling, \"you have never told me what\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.\"\n\n\"I have never told any one, Cecil,\" said Virginia, gravely.\n\n\"I know that, but you might tell me.\"\n\n\"Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you. Poor Sir Simon! I owe\nhim a great deal. Yes, don't laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see\nwhat Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than\nboth.\"\n\nThe Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.\n\n\"You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,\" he murmured.\n\n\"You have always had that, Cecil.\"\n\n\"And you will tell our children some day, won't you?\"\n\nVirginia blushed.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.\n\nYet Millet would have us understand that in spite of this, the\nshepherd is performing a duty to humanity not to be underrated. The\nsheep he has so carefully and conscientiously reared will form food\nto-morrow for many a hungry town-dweller. Further, he would have us\nfollow the peasant as he closes the pen for the night and traces his\ntired steps towards his simple home in the village. The frugal and\nhard-earned meal, prepared for him by his wife, who like himself has\nhad her share of duties to occupy her during the day, is partaken of\nsurrounded by a hungry and joyous group of children. Such themes\nsuggested by the simplicity of his own life appealed to him with\nirresistible force, and it is in their portrayal that his greatness is\nmanifested.\n\nPerhaps no season of the year presented the same attraction for Millet\nas the spring. The period when all the earth after its long winter\nsleep is about to waken into new life seems to have always been a\nsource of inspiration to him. In \"The Sower\" he emphasises the fact\nthat the fruits of the harvest are not to be had without due labour\nbeing expended upon the earth. The sloping field, barren of\nvegetation, and crowned at the top with a small clump of trees, is\nbeing broken up by the distant plough drawn by two horses and guided\nby a peasant. The latter figure is one of the noblest of Millet's\ncreations. By his strained and ever-attentive attitude, by his\ncontinuous tramp over the rough and broken ground, he shows us the\nmonotony of his toil. He crosses the field in one direction, only to\nreturn at an interval of a few feet. In the foreground we have the\nsower, a middle-aged man of typical peasant type, on whose left side a\nbag of seeds is slung. With automatic precision he withdraws a\nhandful, and strews it into the furrows open to receive it. So long as\nhe continues in the same track his labour will be well performed, and\nhence his task is just as monotonous as that of his fellow-worker\nhigher up in the field. The silhouetting of these two figures against\nthe light is symbolical of the labour to be expended in life before\nresults are forthcoming.\n\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that in considering the works of\nMillet, one must not judge him from the standpoint of a mere painter.\n\nHis brush is only the means to an end, and by its means he is enabled\nto bring the fruits of his philosophic observation before us in\npermanent form. It has been charged against the \"Angelus\" that it was\nnot a remarkably fine piece of painting, that many a young artist of\nthe present generation is infinitely better equipped, technically\nspeaking, than the master who wrought this celebrated canvas. This may\nin a measure be true, but it must never be forgotten that Millet\nbrought into play exactly the means which could illustrate his meaning\nin the clearest terms. He had not intended, in painting such a\npicture, to produce a work which would astonish his fellow artists\nwith its brilliancy of handling or magnificence of colour. He wanted\nto make the beholder forget the painter and absorb the lesson. This\nquality runs right through the art of Millet, and it is from this\nstandpoint that we are obliged to weigh his merits.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE\n\n\nJean Fran\u00e7ois Millet was born on October 4, 1814, that is at the\nperiod when French art, at any rate as far as landscape painting is\nconcerned, had reached its lowest ebb. Throughout the eighteenth\ncentury the landscape painter had been hard put to make a living. The\ntaste of connoisseurs throughout the century had been for portraits\nand interiors, or for those numerous pastoral subjects which were\ncarried out with so much decorative charm by such men as Watteau and\nBoucher. Such landscape painting as existed was of the type\npopularised by Vernet; it was built upon a curious mixture of Italian\ninfluence coming from Panini and Salvator Rosa. The only evidence of\nrevolt against such a state of affairs we find in the works of Hubert\nRobert and Moreau. These two, and more especially would I direct the\nreader's attention to the latter, struggled hard to break down the\nconventionalities of the time. They endeavoured to infuse some sense\nof atmosphere into their pictures, and whilst frequently their trees\nand figures are painfully formal, they yet stand alone in the French\nschool as the pioneers of a phase of art which was to attain its\nzenith in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBut after the Revolution, and during the whole of the time that France\nwas under the domination of Napoleon, very rigid principles indeed\nwere enforced with regard to the direction that art should take. The\ninnovation which had its commencement in the reign of Louis XVI. swept\neverything before it as it gained force. Classical art and traditions\ndominated the whole French school, and no artist, however great his\nreputation, attempted for many years to swim against the stream. In\nspite of the principles of liberty and equality which were claimed for\nall under the new r\u00e9gime, a terribly strict eye was kept upon any\ninnovations which might break out in the form of a naturalistic art.\n\nThe directors of this new movement failed to see that the conditions\nwhich had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed\naway, and that the latter's supremacy was due to the fact that their\nproductions were symbolical of the loftiest thoughts of their own\nepoch. The art which expresses the ambitions and noblest thoughts of\nits time will alone endure. These expressions are not applicable to\nany other condition than those which called them forth, and hence in\nattempting to purify the rococo which had existed up to the middle of\nthe eighteenth century, by a return to classical traditions, they were\nonly copying that which their predecessors had done, and in so doing\nleft us without any original expression of their own time.\n\nInto such a condition of affairs was Millet born, and he was numbered\namongst that little band of men which included Rousseau, Corot, Dupr\u00e9,\nDiaz, and Daumier, who were to lay the foundations of the modern\nnaturalistic school. At the outset it was seemingly a hopeless\nstruggle they undertook; a struggle against prejudice and influence\nwhich was only to be brought to a victorious culmination after years\nof struggle and disappointment. Of this little band, Millet was\nperhaps the best equipped for the privations which were necessary. He\ncame of a peasant stock who inhabited Gruchy, a small village\nsituated in the commune of Gr\u00e9ville, close to Cherbourg. Grouped\nunderneath the humble roof was the grandmother, who had been left a\nwidow fifteen years before; her son, Jean Louis Nicolas Millet, and\nhis wife and eight children, of which our artist was the second. His\ngrandmother appears to have been a pious old lady, whose chief delight\nwas in her grandchildren, to whom she taught those religious\nprinciples which stood them in good stead in after life. We are told\nthat Millet's father possessed a force of character one does not often\nfind amongst men in his rank of life. He was of a contemplative\ndisposition, and had a keenly developed feeling for natural beauty. He\npossessed moreover a keen appreciation of music, which unfortunately\nhe does not appear to have had much opportunity of cultivating. His\nwife was an excellent housewife and of a religious turn of mind. The\nhouse they occupied, situated quite a short distance from the sea, was\nplaced in a tract of country which, whilst it had rugged and\npicturesque features, was not of a nature which would yield\nextraordinary results under cultivation. It was, therefore, a hard\nstruggle for existence which Millet in his first years saw going\non around him. Not that the family were any the less happy for having\nto work laboriously for their livelihood. They had been brought up\namidst such surroundings; their wants were simple and easily\ngratified, and the tranquillity of the m\u00e9nage more than\ncounterbalanced those doubtful luxuries which easier circumstances\nwould have brought their way. Throughout his life Millet maintained\nthe extreme simplicity he had seen practised in the home of his\nchildhood, and long years afterwards he was accustomed to look back\nwith pleasureable memories upon his early years.\n\nGruchy, situated in one of the wildest parts of Normandy, feels the\nfull effect of every storm which blows up from the Atlantic. There is\nnothing to shelter the exposed hamlets studded along the coast from\nthe fury of the western gale, and the rocks are but too often strewn\nwith the wrecks of vessels which have come to grief in that terrible\nsea. Millet in his youth must have witnessed many of these\ncatastrophes. Quite a number of drawings by him are extant\nrepresenting succour being extended to some vessel in difficulties, or\nthe hauling up of some wreckage on to the rocks. The studious boy\nmust have been impressed as he saw the sternness of the combat in his\nnative country between men and nature; the wind-swept fields, and\nhills bare to the point of savageness. The very trees themselves\ndwarfed and gnarled; in their struggle with the elements they have\nbeen made tough and hardy as the inhabitants of the country\nthemselves, and, stunted as they are, yet show well that they can\nresist the force of the fiercest storm. The brooding and contemplative\ncharacter of the father having descended to the son, we can quite\nimagine the effect such surroundings would have upon him. As he looked\nback in after years upon his roamings in his native country, he\nappreciated the awe-inspiring character of the scenery in which he had\nbeen born. He would doubtless recall many a walk amidst the fields\nwith the wind blowing in his face as it rushed in from the Atlantic,\nthe rain beating hard upon the freshly ploughed fields, and the\ndistant figure of the ploughman struggling hard with his team against\nthe stiff sou'wester. The great mass of vapour overhead whirled before\nthe violence of the storm, casting grey and pearly light over the\nwhole scene, whilst far away on the top of the hill a clump of trees,\nbent with their resistance to the wind, are silhouetted against the\nsky. Many a drawing of this kind we encounter in the later work of\nMillet, which shows how his thoughts harked back in certain moments to\nthe scenes he had left behind him for ever.\n\nWe know that on one or two occasions he returned to Gruchy. Once or\ntwice he had urgent business which took him back, but sometimes he\nwent with no other purpose than to renew acquaintance with the scenes\nof yore.\n\nLittle Jean Fran\u00e7ois was his grandmother's favourite. It was she who\ntaught him the names of things which surrounded him, and perhaps\ndirected his thoughts in the channels to which they were finally to be\ndevoted. Her brother Charles, who formed one of the family, used to\ntake him for walks, telling him stories on the way. Millet was\ndevotedly attached to this old man, and when at the age of seven years\nhe lost him, the gap in his life thus left made an impression upon his\nmemory never to be effaced.\n\nFive years afterwards he was placed in the hands of the vicar for the\npurpose of preparing him for his first communion. The good man seems\nto have been taken with the child; he found him so attentive to all\nnatural phenomenon which was passing around him and intelligent in an\nunusual degree. He quickly learnt a considerable amount of Latin,\nwhich introduced him to the great classics. Unfortunately for Millet,\nthe vicar accepted an offer of transference to a better parish in the\nvicinity. The boy had made such progress with his master that it was\ndecided that he should go with him to his new abode. He was, however,\nso missed in his own home, that when he came back for his first\nholidays it was decided that he should not return.\n\nHe now gave serious attention to the agricultural pursuits of his\nfather. He threw himself heartily into the work of the farm, and\nassisted in the work of sowing and harvesting, of pruning and\nthrashing according to the season. His spare time was occupied in\nreading with avidity various masterpieces of literature. The authors\nhe found at hand were such as F\u00e9n\u00e9lon and Bossuet, but he developed a\ndecided preference, which lasted till the end of his life, for Virgil\nand the Bible.\n\nIt was at this time that his taste for art began to be developed.\n\nHe drew the objects he found around him, and soon acquired sufficient\nconfidence in his skill to execute a large drawing representing two\nshepherds keeping guard over their sheep. These first efforts date\nfrom about his seventeenth year, and foretell the advent of the style\nin which he was later to become pre-eminent.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE MIGRATION TO PARIS\n\n\nHow frequently has it happened that the first years in the life of a\ngenius have been employed in labour quite different from that to which\nthey should have been directed. Such a state of affairs the more often\noccurs when the sense of duty has been strong enough to overcome\ntemporarily the inclination to pursue the natural bent. In the case of\nMillet, however, the early years which he devoted to the farm and its\npursuits were by no means wasted. It is on record that he became very\nproficient in the various duties in which he was engaged, but at the\nsame time we can be quite sure that his extraordinary faculties of\nobservation were constantly being brought into play, and the fruits of\nhis observations are to be seen in the pictures of his mature period.\n\nA considerable portion of his spare time was taken up with drawing,\nnot only the persons and objects he found around him, but also\nsubjects suggested to him by the books he was in the habit of reading.\n\nHis family, so far from throwing any obstacles in his way, encouraged\nhim. In fact it was his father who took him first to Cherbourg in\norder to show a painter of that town, named Mouchel, the early\nproducts of his son's genius. The decision at which Millet p\u00e8re had\narrived was prompted by a drawing in charcoal of an old peasant\nwalking along the road, which had struck him forcibly as being a work\nof extraordinary merit. It says much for Mouchel's breadth of mind\nthat he was equally impressed with the drawings. A man who had been\nbrought up in the school of David, and who had lived in one of the\nmost reactionary periods of French art, was hardly to be expected to\ntake kindly to a style so diametrically opposed to all the traditions\ninto which he himself had been inculcated; certainly the young\nMillet, who had now arrived at the age of eighteen, had not developed\nthe extraordinary freedom which his works of ten years later\ndemonstrate. But there was sufficient originality even in his early\ndrawings to call forth condemnation from a man who had been so\nsaturated with the teaching of David.\n\nHe prevailed upon Millet to leave his son with him, and set him to\nwork to copy many well-known works of art which he brought before his\npupil by means of engravings. Two months were spent in this way when\nnews reached Millet that his father had been seized with sudden\nillness, and he was obliged in the circumstances to return to\nGr\u00e9ville. He arrived to find the old man unconscious, and very shortly\nafterwards he died.\n\nThis misfortune awoke in Millet a sense of duty which compelled him to\ndesert his studies in Cherbourg and superintend the management of the\nfarm. For some time he devoted himself entirely to his new duties, but\nthe struggle betwixt duty and genius continued; he gave himself to his\nwork with all the energy at his disposal, but his thoughts were ever\nwandering to his art.\n\nAdded to his own inclinations, his grandmother, who perceived his\nextraordinary gifts, strongly persuaded him to devote his attention\nentirely to art, and consequently after some little time he decided to\nreturn to Cherbourg. Here he entered the studio of M. Langlois, an\nartist whose reputation in the town was considerable. Again in this\nworthy man he came in contact with a painter who had been brought up\nentirely under classical influence. Langlois, who had in his early\ndays been a pupil of Gros, had absorbed the classical tradition to\nsuch an extent as to be incapable of appreciating any other style. He\nappears to have endeavoured to mould Millet in his own method rather\nthan develop the latent genius which the latter possessed. The\nincompatibility of these two men speedily caused the younger to strike\nout in his own way. He saw more good in frequenting the museums and\nmaking copies of such works as appealed to him than in listening to\nthe advice of his teacher. All this occurred, however, without any\nbreach of friendship occurring. On the contrary, Langlois, after\nperceiving the futility of inducing his pupil to follow in his\nfootsteps, did all he could to advance his interests.\n\nBy means of his influence some of Millet's drawings were brought\nbefore the Municipal Council, and Langlois suggested that Millet\nshould be sent to Paris in order to further his development, and that\nthe Council should set aside a modest pension to meet his requirements\nin that city. The discussion appears to have been very prolonged, and\nupon the question being put to a vote it was only carried by means of\nthe casting vote of the mayor. Four hundred francs was at first\nallotted to him in this way, which was further increased shortly\nafterwards to six hundred. Such encouragement, meagre though it was,\nwas sufficient to give him a foothold in the metropolis. He left\nCherbourg in January 1837, on a cold and raw day, the snow falling\nheavily throughout the entire journey, and arrived in Paris in a very\ndisheartened condition. The miserable weather, coupled with the long\njourney in which he had had time to think of the small sum which lay\nbetween him and starvation, going to a city which he had never seen\nbefore, had all served to work upon his nerves, and he entered the\ngreat city sick at heart and very despondent.\n\nOne of the first visits he made after he was somewhat settled down in\nParis was to the Louvre. Here he was brought into contact for the\nfirst time with many masters, who were to mould his yet plastic\ntemperament into the form which enabled him to give to the world, in\nlater years, so many masterpieces. As I have said before, it was\nMantegna who first captivated him, and the influence of the mighty\nPaduan was never finally to be shaken off. Michel Angelo awed him with\nhis sublimity; his classical severity tempered with intense humanism,\nhis masculine strength, were bound to have their effect upon so\nserious a character as Millet. Strange as it may seem to those who are\nbut superficially acquainted with his art, and are only too apt to\njudge him by the influence he has had upon modern French painting, he\nwas fascinated with the antique. The traditions of Phidias and\nPraxiteles, in the form in which they had been transmitted through the\ngreatest minds of the Renaissance, were ever the factors which guided\nhim throughout his career. It was this same spirit which impelled his\nfervid admiration for Nicolas Poussin, a master who to-day is sadly\nunderrated and but little understood. It was the mysteries of line,\nthe wonders of pose and composition rather than the magic of colour\nwhich appealed to him. He had a profound admiration for the glowing\ncanvases of Titian and Rubens, but he could never overlook entirely\ntheir defects of drawing or, in the case of Rubens, the tendency to\nvulgarity. From his remarks in after years it would appear that he was\nbaffled with the mysticisms of Velazquez and Rembrandt; pure painting\nitself could never hold him. He needed to grasp the message which lay\nbehind it before he felt fully taken into the confidence of the\npainter; and as the minds of the Dutchman and the Spaniard ran in\nquite different channels to his own, they spoke with a language he\nnever understood. That he had a perceptive and critically independent\nmind may be gauged from his enthusiasm for Delacroix, whose work he\nencountered for the first time at the Luxembourg.\n\nDuring this period of study he was carefully considering under what\nmaster he should place himself. His choice unhappily fell upon\nDelaroche. To any one acquainted with the work of the latter master,\na more unsuitable selection could not have been made. Delaroche and\nthe painters who surrounded him can be appropriately described as\nconstituting the back-wash of the Empire style, which had reached its\nclimax with David. His subjects were always treated with academic\nreserve. No pyrotechnics were permitted; on the contrary, an\neverlasting and mistaken striving for finish was encouraged:\noriginality was sternly suppressed. To paint human life as it really\nwas, was too vulgar for any of the painters of this time. They held\nthe public taste enslaved for years. An innovator such as Millet was\ndestined to become found his position almost untenable. The band of\ncritics and painters formed a monopoly which it seemed almost\nimpossible to break down, and it was only after years of bitter and\ndetermined struggle that the school of nature finally routed its\nopponent.\n\nDelaroche doubtlessly found the peasant painter a little rude both in\nhis person and in his ideas about art. He paid but little attention to\nthe young man who had placed himself in his hands, and devoted all his\ntime to students who were more amenable to his influence. A\ntemperament so sensitive as Millet's was bound to notice this\nneglect, and consequently after a time he became so discouraged that\nhe ceased to frequent Delaroche's studio. Another very good reason for\nthis action was the lack of resources to continue his payments. Even\nduring the time he had been with Delaroche he lost no opportunity of\nturning a few honest francs by painting the portraits of any who could\nbe got to sit to him. Delaroche, however, had a more kindly heart than\nMillet imagined. He seems to have found out the real distress of the\nyoung artist, and to have assisted him pecuniarily in many ways, and\nthere is no doubt that he appreciated the talent of the young Norman\nmuch more than he cared to own. Many of his remarks on record would\nserve to show that Delaroche already felt that his pupil was destined\nto be one of the leaders of the movement which was finally to\noverthrow his own style, and doubtlessly felt a great admiration for a\nman who had the courage and strength to swim against rather than with\nthe current.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STRUGGLE FOR RECOGNITION\n\n\nFreed from all encumbrances save poverty, Millet was now to work out\nhis own destiny according to the dictates of his genius. He joined a\nfriend named Marolle, and the two together occupying a very small\napartment endeavoured to eke out an existence. It was only too soon\napparent that young as he was, and the taste of the public being not\nyet ready for development upon the lines his genius directed him, that\nhis livelihood could not be secured by endeavouring to sell such\nsubjects as appealed to him. In these straits he turned to\nportrait-painting, just as many great painters before and since him\nhave done. That the struggle was very keen can well be imagined by the\nfact that he was unable to obtain more than five to ten francs apiece;\nand, as commissions were very scarce, he was hard put to gain the\nmeans of subsistence. This state of affairs lasted until 1840, in\nwhich year he endeavoured to obtain admission to the Salon with two\nportraits, one of which was that of his friend. This, however, was\nrejected, and the other picture, although accepted, was unnoticed by\neither the critics or the public.\n\nHaving occasion the next year to pay a visit to Cherbourg, he felt\nobliged to report himself to the Municipal Council who had had the\ngenerosity to send him in the first place to Paris. Its worthy members\nexpressed themselves as but little satisfied with the result of their\ninvestment; they claimed that they had had as yet but little to show\nfor their money, and they suggested, partly as a means of\ndemonstrating that they had had some little return, and also, in order\nto see of what stuff their prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was made, that he should paint a\nportrait of the recently deceased mayor. As Millet had not been\npersonally acquainted with that worthy citizen, and as the only guide\nwhich could be supplied him was a portrait made in miniature when he\nwas a young man of some twenty-three or twenty-four years of age, the\ntask was by no means easy. However, the artist set to work with a\nwill, and finally accomplished the picture to his own satisfaction.\n\nUpon it being shown to the Council, one and all declared, as any one\nwith the slightest knowledge of such matters could have told them\nbefore it was commenced, that it bore not the least resemblance to the\ndefunct magistrate. They therefore demurred at the three hundred\nfrancs they had agreed to pay him for the portrait, and offered him\none-third of that amount instead. Millet was deeply offended by the\ninsult, and informed the Council that he made them a present of the\npicture.\n\nIt was during this short visit to his native country that he met his\nfirst wife, a Mlle. Ono, whose portrait he had painted. From the first\nshe was very delicate, and he lost her after much suffering, three\nyears later. His second wife was Mlle. Catherine Lemaire, who was\ndestined to be the companion of his struggles until the end of his\nlife.\n\nMeanwhile Millet was occupied with subjects which he thought would\nappeal to the general public. A number of classical pictures date from\nthis epoch. It was an endeavour on his part to fall in as far as\npossible with the current taste, and so supply means of subsistence\nfor his family. At the same time he did not neglect his favourite\nsubjects, and many are the wonderful studies of peasant life which\ndate from these years. His reputation had so far advanced that he was\noffered the position of teacher of drawing in the college at\nCherbourg. It must have been only after prolonged deliberation that he\nrefused the proffered post. Here a certain annual stipend was assured\nhim, and if it was not large in itself it would at any rate suffice to\nkeep the wolf from the door. He preferred, however, to return to Paris\nand work out his own destiny as best he might.\n\nMillet, who lived at this time in the Rue Rochechouart, began to\nsurround himself with that little group of friends who remained\nfaithful to him until the end of his career. Amongst the earliest were\nCharles Jacque and Diaz: the latter had several clients amongst the\nsmall dealers, whom he induced to visit Millet's studio and make now\nand again a small purchase.\n\nMillet now became a fairly regular contributor to the Salon, but\ngenerally sent some classical or religious picture as well as one of\nhis peasant subjects. For example, in 1848 he sent the marvellous\nstudy of \"The Winnower,\" which we all know so well, accompanied by a\ncanvas, \"The Captivity of the Jews at Babylon.\" The latter, however,\nwas so badly received that he utilised the canvas upon its return for\na large picture of a \"Shepherdess tending her Sheep.\"\n\nIn spite of the headway that he was making, the struggle for existence\nseemed keener than ever, and but for the kindness of friends he and\nhis family would frequently have actually wanted for food. A timely\nadvance of one hundred francs obtained for him from the Minister of\nFine Arts, together with a commission from the State, for which he was\npaid the sum of eighteen hundred francs, were for some time the only\nrelief he obtained from his embarrassments. That he was not particular\nas to how he earned his daily bread is apparent from the fact that he\ndid not despise an order for a shop sign for a midwife, for which he\nwas paid the miserable amount of thirty francs.\n\nThe year 1848 was not an encouraging one for a painter who was\nstanding on the threshold of his career. The whole of Europe was\nseething with revolution. A repetition of the fearful year of 1792 was\neverywhere expected. The struggle betwixt reaction and property on the\none hand, and lawlessness and revolution on the other, was being waged\nwith grim determination. The issue was for long in the balance. One\nnever knew from one day to another what was going to happen. In such a\ndeplorable state of affairs men's minds were running on politics and\nwars rather than upon art. Millet amongst the rest was called upon to\nshoulder the musket, and it can be easily imagined with what\nreluctance he did so.\n\nParis, the great centre of art, had yet not afforded him much\nencouragement. Life was dear in the big city, and surrounded on all\nsides by bricks and mortar he was not free to go out into the fields\nand study the objects which were uppermost in his mind. He resolved to\nescape from it, and once having put the plan into execution he never\nreturned.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET IN HIS MATURITY\n\n\nThe Barbizon of 1850 was a very different place from the Barbizon of\nto-day. The world fame of the men who passed a quiet and strenuous\nexistence in the little village has transformed it into a tourist\nresort, with restaurants and caf\u00e9s, the stopping-places for\nwaggonettes which in summer bring their daily load of sightseers,\neager to see the homes of the painters whose names are now household\nwords.\n\nIt would have been well-nigh impossible for the little band to have\nchosen a more suitable spot for their labours. Rousseau and Millet,\nmuch as they were drawn towards each other by the tie of a sympathetic\ndisposition and by their common interest in art, yet were widely\ndissimilar from one another in their outlook upon art and their\nmethods of worship at the common shrine. Rousseau--one can see it from\nevery picture he painted--loved with all the yearning of a passionate\nand restless temperament the inanimate in Nature. Observe with what\nfidelity he draws his trees, with what caressing tenderness his clouds\nand skies are treated; solitude appealed to him above all things, and\nif here and there he was obliged to insert a few figures to complete\nhis composition, one instinctively feels that he would rather have\nsubstituted a group of cattle or a flock of sheep. In the glades of\nthe forest, far from the busy haunts of men, with the glorious\nsunlight penetrating from above, the breeze moaning through the\nbranches, he was happy. A wild and turbulent temperament such as his\nnot infrequently discovers exquisite enjoyment amidst such perfect\ntranquillity.\n\nBarbizon, situated on the fringe of the great forest of Fontainebleau,\ntherefore, permitted Rousseau to come into daily contact with the\nscenes which so appealed to him.\n\nMillet, on the other hand, was absorbed in the peasant. The man who\ntilled the soil and raised the produce humanity requires for its\nsubsistence by the sweat of his brow; the manifold duties of the\nlabourer, his life and sorrows, appealed to him with irresistible\nforce. An unpeopled track of wild and uncultivated land would not call\nforth any emotion in him, no matter how sublime the scenery might be.\n\nThe life of the village, spreading itself into the vast and fertile\nplain behind, held him absorbed; a peasant himself and living amongst\nthe people he so loved, he was in a position to bring before an\nunthinking world the poignant monotony of their useful lives.\n\nUpon their first arrival at Barbizon, the two artists put up at a\nsmall inn, working all day in a tiny place they had rented from some\npeasants and fitted up as a studio. The inconveniences of this\narrangement were soon apparent, and shortly afterwards Millet took a\nsmall house which was destined to be his abode for the remainder of\nhis life; an old barn in the immediate vicinity meanwhile provided him\nwith an excellent studio.\n\nFrom this period onward we must date the greatest productions of the\nmaster, the works which have induced more thought than those of any\nother peasant painter. A peasant among peasants, his life was of the\nmost rigid simplicity. Behind his little abode a large garden\nstretched away almost to the fringe of the forest itself, and here he\nwas accustomed to work every morning, growing a portion of the food\nnecessary to the sustenance of his family. The afternoon he devoted to\npainting, whilst the evening was given over to intercourse with his\nlittle circle of friends. The simplicity and tranquillity of his life\naroused the whole of his powers to action, and surrounded with\neverything he valued in life he was supremely happy.\n\nThe country around Barbizon appealed to him irresistibly. The\ntimber-studded plains, the gently undulating, highly cultivated\nfields, presented a strange contrast to the wild and rugged country\namidst which he had spent his childhood, and no doubt conduced to the\ndevelopment of a more refined and contemplative style than he would\notherwise have acquired. Upon his few visits to his native country he\nappears to have been more impressed than ever with its austerity, and\nthe drawings which these journeys called forth bore ample evidence of\nthis feeling in him.\n\nLack of the necessary funds to carry on even his simple m\u00e9nage was\never the bane of Millet's life. On many occasions Sensier, his\nintimate friend and afterwards his biographer, informs us he dissuaded\nhim from suicide.\n\nThe sums that he owed, small though they were, rendered him in\nconstant fear of the brokers. With creditors so importunate in their\ndemands for satisfaction, and with the constant lack of recognition,\nwhich was his lot, it is astonishing that Millet achieved so much. He\nwas relieved more than once by the kind-hearted and ever faithful\nRousseau, who when his friend was sorest pressed found some delicately\nhidden means to relieve him. It was he who acquired for 4000 francs\nthe wonderful \"Peasant grafting a Tree,\" when the picture failed to\nfind a purchaser; and in order that Millet should not be aware of his\ngenerosity, he made the offer in the name of an imaginary American.\n\nThis sort of goodness he repeated more than once, and it redounds\nstill more to his credit when we remember that Rousseau himself was\nnot infrequently in pecuniary difficulties.\n\nA constant succession of important works made their appearance during\nthe first ten years Millet spent at Barbizon. The first was the\nwell-known \"Sower,\" which has ever been one of the most popular of his\npictures. Then came the far finer \"Peasants going to Work,\" which for\nmany years was in an English Collection. The \"Gleaners,\" perhaps the\nnoblest canvas the master ever painted, dates from 1857, in which year\nit was seen at the Salon; the celebrated \"Angelus\" followed it two\nyears later. The prices which Millet obtained for this series of\nremarkable works was fantastically small. The \"Gleaners\" brought him a\npaltry 2000 francs, whilst he accounted himself lucky to encounter an\namateur who gave him the same sum for the small \"Woman feeding Fowls.\"\n\nThe \"Angelus,\" which was never exhibited, was sold in the year it was\npainted to a Monsieur Feydeau, an architect, for 1800 francs. It then\npassed through several hands before the late Monsieur Secr\u00e9tan\ncompeted up to 160,000 francs before he became possessed of the prize\nat the John Wilson sale.\n\nThe purchase, however, proved a sound investment, for upon the\ndispersal of his collection it was knocked down for 553,000 francs to\na Monsieur Proust, acting on behalf of the French Government. The\nlatter, however, when they gave the commission to buy the picture, had\nno idea that such a high value would be placed upon it, and\nconsequently refused to ratify the sale; a syndicate now came upon the\nscene, who took it to America. The price, however, proved greater than\neven the millionaires of the States were prepared to give, and the\ncanvas again returned to France, where it found a resting-place in the\ncollection of Monsieur Chauchard, who paid the enormous sum of 800,000\nfrancs for its possession.\n\nIn 1859 Millet sent two works to the Salon, a \"Woman grazing her Cow,\"\nand \"Death and the Woodman.\" The latter, one of the most\nphilosophical of Millet's pictures, which to-day is the principal\nattraction of the Jacobsen Museum at Copenhagen, was rejected.\n\nDisappointments of this kind came with such systematic regularity to\nthe painter that he must have become proof against them. He always had\nbitter enemies amongst the critics, who never failed to pour abuse\nupon his method and his subjects. Even a number of his fellow artists\njoined in the chorus of disapproval. But the vehemence with which he\nwas attacked was striking evidence of the impression he was making and\nthe inward sense of his own powers; and the fact that he was working\nout his destiny according to the dictates of his own genius supported\nhim against this outpouring of prejudice and malice. The social side\nof life appealed to him more strongly as the years rolled on, and the\nmurmurings which had been heard in 1859 as to the socialistic\ntendencies of \"Death and the Woodman\" swelled to a roar when the\nstupendous \"Man with the Hoe\" was exhibited fourteen years later. The\nlatter, one of the most virile studies of depraved humanity which the\nworld has ever seen, has always been a favourite with social\nreformers, and has inspired one remarkable poem. Even his most\nimplacable critics were disarmed before this canvas; its power was\nmagnetic; it was an inspiration, soul moving and trenchant.\n\nHis financial difficulties never completely dispersed. At one time, in\norder to insure himself a little tranquillity, he made a contract with\ntwo speculators, whereby they were to become possessors of all the\nwork he produced for three years, in consideration of their assuring\nhim a thousand francs a month. A great number of Millet's finest\nproductions passed thus through their hands, including the \"Return\nfrom the Fields\" and the \"Man with the Hoe.\" The partners were not\nlong in quarrelling, and after a lawsuit had been fought, Millet was\nleft in the hands of a man who frequently would not or could not pay\nhim in ready money, and whose bills he was frequently forced to\ndiscount at considerable loss.\n\nOne little gleam of sunshine rendered his later days happy. This was a\ncommission from a Colmar banker, Monsieur Thomas by name, who required\nfour allegorical compositions representing the Seasons, to decorate\nhis rooms. The artist was overjoyed by this piece of good fortune,\nand immediately commenced a most conscientious study of such mural\ndecoration as was within reach, in order that he might do full justice\nto his patron. He paid frequent visits to Fontainebleau and the\nLouvre, and even desired a friend to inquire if he could not obtain\nreproductions of the frescoes at Herculaneum and Pompeii. In spite of\nall this elaborate preparation, the subjects were not such as appealed\nto his genius, and in spite of them being well and soundly painted, we\nare told that they presented no features which called for special\ncomment.\n\nHe found, however, a much more genial occupation in accomplishing a\nseries of drawings ordered by a Monsieur Gavet, who paid the artist\n1000, 700, and 450 francs each, according to their size. He made\naltogether ninety-five drawings in this way, and it is said that this\ngentleman had in his possession the finest work in black and white and\nwater-colour the artist ever executed.\n\nTowards the latter end of his life the death of dear relatives and\nfriends cast a sorrowful gloom over him. Amongst the latter Rousseau,\nwho expired in his presence on the 22nd of December 1867, was\nperhaps the loss which seemed to him hardest to bear. A staunch and\ntrusty friend, who was to be relied upon when his prospects seemed the\nmost hopeless, he had been one of the very few who had appreciated\nMillet's talents at their full worth, and who, moreover, scanty as his\nown means were, was ever ready to stretch out his hand to assist his\nstruggling friend.\n\nShortly afterwards Millet paid a visit to his patron, Herr Hartmann,\nat M\u00fcnster, and from here he went for a short time into Switzerland.\n\nUpon his return he devoted himself with great earnestness to work, and\nachieved a certain success at the Salons with his exhibits. The\noutbreak of the war with Germany caused him to migrate with his family\nto Cherbourg, where he thought he might continue to work, removed as\nfar as possible from the scenes of carnage and struggle which were\ngoing on farther east. Transported once more amongst the scenes of his\nchildhood, he felt an increased impetus to production, and when he\nreturned to Barbizon late in 1871, he brought with him a number of\ncanvases of the highest quality; conspicuous amongst them was the\nwonderful \"Gr\u00e9ville Church,\" now in the Louvre.\n\nThe anxieties of his troublous life were, however, beginning to show\ntheir effect upon his constitution; a persistent cough developed, and\nalthough an amelioration would occasionally occur, it was always\nsucceeded by a worse condition than before. His health suffered a\ngeneral decline, and he finally breathed his last on the 20th of\nJanuary 1875. He was buried in the little cemetery of Chailly, beside\nhis friend Rousseau, amidst the scenery they both loved so well.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE MAN AND HIS ART\n\n\nMillet is an instance of an artist working out his own destiny,\nimpelled by irresistible genius, in the teeth of seemingly\ninsurmountable obstacles. He started life with enormous disadvantages;\nwithout friends in influential circles to spread his fame or plead his\ncause; without money to enable him to outlive and triumph over the\nignorant fanaticism of critics and artists, so soaked in the\nconventionalised art of their time that they had not perception enough\nto appreciate the full meaning of that naturalistic movement, which\nwas finally to sweep away the quasi-classic art they boasted of with\nsuch bombastic effusion. The path was hard and thorny, and his triumph\nwas not finally consummated until after his death. He himself found\nhis only satisfaction in the fact that he had lived his life according\nto the dictates of his genius, and had achieved the maximum of which\nhe was capable.\n\nMillet and our own Cotman were somewhat kindred spirits; there is much\nmore affinity between the work of the two men than is apparent to any\none who has not closely studied them. The marvellous \"Breaking the\nClod,\" now happily permanently housed at the British Museum, betrays\nthe same tremendous conception and broad outlook which characterises\nmany a drawing of Millet's. Both highly strung to a painful extent,\nthey were each conscious of their inability to curb the power which\nprescribed a certain course for them, and in spite of pecuniary\ndifficulties and unpopularity, an inevitable result of their intense\noriginality, they pursued a steady course to the end of their lives.\n\nThe socialistic doctrines which have been read into the work of Millet\nare rather the outcome of the world's uneasy conscience being brought\nface to face with a crushing indictment of existing conditions, than\nof any design on the artist's part to further the cause of a political\npropaganda by means of his art. This somewhat extravagant reading into\nhis art has certainly been carried to excess. Particularly has such\nbeen the case in America, where a large number of his finest works are\nat present to be found, curiously enough in the hands of enormously\nwealthy people, who are frequently perhaps the least able to\nunderstand the real meaning of his message.\n\nComing from a peasant stock, his sympathies were always with the\npeasant; it was the only class he understood or cared for. He lived as\none of them, and shared to a large extent in their labour. He has been\ndesignated, not inappropriately, the philosopher in sabots. Rightly or\nwrongly he has come to be looked upon as one of the high priests of\ncommunistic doctrines. Few pictures have been so anathematised as the\n\"Man with the Hoe,\" and perhaps none have done more to inculcate\nsympathy with the degradation of the lower orders of the human race.\n\nThe revolting brutality and vacancy of that face haunts the\nimagination. Is it possible that fellow-creatures so utterly debased\nby toil and neglect exist? Millet dispels any doubt upon the question\nby bequeathing to humanity this trenchant portrait. By no means\nlimited to Barbizon or France, these poor creatures exist in every\ncountry, and curiously enough are considered an essential element in\neach country's development.\n\nThis poignantly human note is observable in almost every work Millet\nwrought; his passionate sympathy with his fellow-man is the keynote of\nhis art. The wood-cutter in his arduous toil, the shepherd in his\nsolitariness, the labourer turning the soil with unvarying and\nlaborious monotony, the mother caring for her children--all carry the\nsame message for him of that strange and incomprehensible mingling of\njoy and sadness we call life. Like many great minds before and since\nhis time, our artist found the greatest joy in life in a placid and\nnever changing melancholy. But the peasants he chose knew nothing of\nthe sadness he saw in them. Completely inured to their toil, and\nsubdued by it, with no refining or uplifting influence to stimulate\nthem, they knew nothing, aspired to nothing beyond what they were; it\nwas left to Millet to supply the \"might have been.\" He saw the inky\nblackness of the mind of the \"Man with the Hoe,\" the pathetic\ninequality between the mounted farmer directing the safe storage of\nhis crop, and the stooping figures of the \"Gleaners\" eager to scrape\nup the miserable crumbs which had fallen from the rich man's table. He\ntraced the lives of these simple folk until we arrive at the grim and\ngaunt figure of Death, who, as he grasps the woodman by the shoulder,\nreminds him that his course is finished and that he, in common with\nall his fellow-men, must enter the great unknown land from which there\nis no return. It is a sad and melancholy art, vibrating with purity\nand truth, the outpouring of a great soul yearning to express itself\nto the utmost of its power. The mind and character of the man can be\nread in every line and in every touch of the brush. His drawings and\netchings are even more searching in their virility than his pictures.\n\nThere is a spontaneousness about them we search for in vain in his\nwork in oil and pastel. In black and white his intensely emotional\nmind found a swift method of expression; in the laboriousness of oil\npainting he was fettered with the complications of the medium. It can\nbe fairly said that only in one or two paintings--a notable example\ncan be cited in the wondrous \"Sawyers\" at South Kensington--does he\nrise to the height of a great painter. Millet was a poet, a\nphilosopher, a great thinker, and the means he chose for expressing\nhimself were those which were best fitted to his purpose. His\npredilections in art were concentrated upon the greatest, and\nconsequently the men who appealed to him were the thinkers of the\nages. Mantegna and Correggio, Michel Angelo and the mighty Greeks,\nthese were the masters who left their impress upon his mind and art.\n\nThe influence of so sincere and profound an artist has necessarily\nbeen profound. He has moulded men who have achieved world-wide fame;\nSegantini, for example, would never have risen to the heights he did\nhad the example of Millet not been ever before him. There have been\nmany who, without possessing his genius, have endeavoured to follow\nin his footsteps, but successfully as his imitators have sometimes\ncaught his style, their productions can never live alongside his,\nbecause they lack the real ring of sincerity.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n        a. One bed, or folding cot,\n        b. One oil stove,\n        c. One lamp,\n        d. Enough supplies of all kinds sufficient for six months,\n        e. Pots, pans, kettles, etc.\nIt is needless to say that positions in Manila and Iloilo were now at\na premium.\n\nWas it possible that teachers were to be sent to places where even the\nnecessaries of life could not be obtained! Was it possible that many\nwould be sent to places so remote that for six months no fresh\nsupplies could be gotten! A mass meeting was held at once, and a\ncommittee was appointed to send a cablegram to the Associated Press\npetitioning aid from the American people at large. Realizing what\nconsternation would be created throughout the United States by such a\nmessage, two of the teachers leaped into a carriage at the close of\nthe meeting and a few moments later were closeted with the chief\nexecutive of the department. As a result the committee was persuaded\nnot to send the cablegram to the Associated Press until by courtesy it\nhad been sent to the President. Of course, this diplomatic move tided\naffairs over and the teachers who had flatly refused to budge from\nManila now agreed to go on to their stations, being assured that\nwhatever action was best would be taken.\n\nThe day had come when we must separate. We were to enter an untried\nand an unknown field. It was fitting that we have a final joyous\nmeeting, so the best orchestra in the archipelago was engaged and we\n\"chased the hours with flying feet\" until dawn so that whatever might\ncome to us in that unknown future upon which we were entering each\nwould hold in pleasant memory our last evening together.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER III. - A DRAMA IN ACTUAL LIFE.\n\n\nAlmost every one heeded the warning to go to his station forearmed\nwith at least necessaries of life, but, as it had never fallen to the\nlot of the writer to cook, he refused to learn at that late day, so he\ntook no pot, no pan, no kettle, putting his future into the hands of\nan uncertain fate and relying upon the unknown hospitality of the\nFilipino.\n\nBacalod, the capital of the province of Occidental Negros, was our\ndestination. The second morning after leaving Manila, we awoke with\nthe \"Kilpatrick\" lying at anchor in a shallow bay. We were several\nmiles from the shore and nothing in sight indicated that we had\nreached a place of any importance. Late the night before we had been\nawakened by the loud, sharp ringing of the ship's bells, accompanied\nby the reversal of the engines and a general disturbance awaking the\ncrew. So our first impressions on coming on deck were that we had run\naground. But the captain assured us that everything was ship-shape and\nthat this was the nearest point of approach to Capiz, a town of\nconsiderable importance on the island of Panay, where a body of troops\nwas to embark for home. Not even the grass hut of a native was in\nsight. Search as we would, not a sign was seen of a stream flowing\ninto the sea, indicating the probable presence of a town. There was\nnot a sign of life of any kind save one lone column of thin, blue\nsmoke that arose from the side of a mountain miles away. One would\nhave thought that we were explorers of three hundred years ago lying\noff the shore of some unknown land.\n\nAfter breakfast the steam launch, together with all the boats, was\nlowered, and several of us who had determined to miss no opportunity\nto gather information about the islands took our places in the launch\nby the side of the ship's mate, and steamed away across the water with\na long line of boats strung out in the rear. We headed away toward a\ngroup of cocoanut trees, and about an hour later stepped ashore on a\npile of decayed coral rocks that extended some twenty or thirty feet\nout into the water, thus forming the only landing place of a town of\nseveral thousands of people and of considerable commercial importance.\n\nA few moments after we had landed, an army wagon drawn by a\nmagnificent pair of mules came up out of a tropical jungle along a\nnarrow road. We clambered into the wagon and were soon lost in the\ndepths of foliage from which we had just seen the vehicle emerge.\n\nLong waving bamboos with their plumy leafage hung over the road from\neach side, meeting and overlapping in the center until they formed an\narchway so dense that the tropical sun now high in the heavens\npenetrated it only at intervals. At times the wagon sank up to the\nhubs in the soft earth, and the muscles of the mules stood out like\nwhip-cords under the skin as they drew us forward.\n\nAt a sharp turn in the road we came upon the first division of troops\nthat was to embark for home. The look of joy upon their sun-browned\nfaces was inexpressible. Their work was done, and with elastic step\nand smiling faces they saluted us as they passed by. The reign of\nforce was at an end; it was going out with them; the reign of peace\nhad begun; it was coming in with us.\n\nIn the afternoon when we returned from the town the last of the troops\nhad arrived and, as we drove up, the bugle was sounding the call to\nsupper. We noticed native women mingling with the troops and, indeed,\na native woman was in constant attention waiting upon one of the\nsoldiers with whom we ate. Her clothes were clean, her hair was nicely\ncombed, and her general appearance was neat. She seemed to anticipate\nthe slightest wish of the soldier with whom she was. She brought him\nwater to drink, cleaned his plate after the meal and saw that his\nknife, fork, and spoon were put into his haversack.\n\nWe had now finished supper and the launch had returned for the last\nload of troops. The lieutenant in command of the company gave the\norder to \"fall in\"; the men shouldered their rifles and fell into\nline. \"Forward, march!\" called the lieutenant, and the column swept\nforward towards the boats. The women had until now restrained\nthemselves, but, as their husbands marched away never to return, their\nfeelings could no longer be restrained. One young woman of about\neighteen, who was leaning against a rock by the roadside sobbing, when\nher husband passed, leaped up in frenzy of passionate love and caught\nthe rifle from his shoulder. Her first impulse seemed to be to throw\nthe gun away, but suddenly realizing the futility of such an act she\nburst into tears, shouldered the rifle herself and marched on by his\nside. Another woman of more mature age threw her arms around the legs\nof a tall stalwart man, and drew him bodily from the line.\n\nBut the troops marched on and entered the boats. One woman who had\nbeen unnoticed before came down into the shallow water and caught hold\nof our last boat as if to prevent its leaving, while others stood\nmingling their sobs with the sounds of the wavelets as they broke on\nthe sands. As we passed away, an expectant mother, standing in bold\noutline against the twilight sky, threw up her hands in an agony of\ndespair and then sank upon the stones. The curtain had fallen upon a\ndrama in actual life deeper in pathos than any other we had ever seen\nor ever expected to see. Depth of passion, depth of love! Who can\nfathom the human heart?\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. - WHAT THE TEACHERS DID.\n\n\nThere is a remarkable sameness about the towns in the Philippines.\n\nThey all have a large open square about the middle of the town, around\nthree sides of which are Chinese stores, unless one side lies open to\nthe sea, and on the fourth is the great stone ecclesia. The streets\nrun at right angles to one another and divide up the town into\ncreditable squares.\n\nEverybody in the Philippines lives up-stairs, for the ground is so\nsoaked with water during the rainy season that it is a menace to\nhealth to live upon the ground floor. So even the poorest nippa hut\nis built upon stakes four or five feet above the ground.\n\nBacalod is a typical Philippine town. As we landed, a broad open\nsquare was spread out before us. Two sides of the square were lined\nwith two-story houses in which were Chinese stores below and Filipino\nhomes above. On the third side stood the great stone church in whose\nmassive tower the clock was striking the hour of four, while the\nfourth lay open to the sea that had borne us thither.\n\nWe landed, but it was in a method new to us and one not usually\nemployed by the traveling public.\n\nWhen our sail boat ran aground on the sandy bottom a hundred yards or\nmore from the shore, a crowd of Filipino men who were on the beach\nslowly rolled up their pantaloons and waded out to the rescue,--for\nthe money that was in it. The boat's crew elevated their trousers'\nlegs also and slided down into the water. Each of us then straddled\nthe neck of a Filipino standing in the water and was held by ankles to\nbe steadied while our biped mounts proceeded to the shore.\n\nWe were now on the ground and face to face with the situation. To give\nthe reader an idea of the actual conditions met by the first teachers\nwho went to the Islands, the following is copied from the instructions\ngiven us in Manila:\n    1. There shall be two sessions daily of all schools, and the\n    last hour of the morning session shall be devoted solely to\n    instructing the Filipino teachers.\n\n    2. In cases where teachers are sent to a town in which there\n    is no school-house, they are expected to secure the aid of the\n    people and have one built.\n\n    3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is\n    stopped.\n\n    4. All supplies must be kept under lock and key. In towns\n    where there is no case or box to lock the supplies in, and it\n    is also impossible to get the town council to furnish a case,\n    a requisition may be sent to Manila, and, if an appropriation\n    can be secured, one will be made and sent out.\n\nThus it can be easily seen that we were indeed pioneers. In many\nplaces no school-house was to be found, and in some cases it was even\ndifficult to get the town council to provide a case in which to keep\nthe supplies.\n\nThe work of the teachers was, in short; to \"make the English language\nthe basis of instruction in the public schools.\" On our arrival at\nBacalod two schools were found in progress, for some soldiers had been\ndetailed for the work here previous to our coming. One of these was\nfor boys and the other, for girls. Thus the work here had been in a\nmeasure simplified, but complications that had arisen at Talisay, one\nof the largest and richest towns on the island, demanded a change of\nteachers and the writer was assigned to the place as superintendent.\n\nHere an attempt had been made to start a school but it had failed\nignominiously and a system of education was to be put into operation\nfrom the very start.\n\nThe Filipinos are not strong advocates of co-education, so separate\nschools were to be started for the boys and the girls. The one for the\nboys was gotten well in hand before the one for the girls was\nattempted at all.\n\nA few days after reaching the town and securing a home the\npresidente of the town had it publicly announced that the following\nMonday morning at eight o'clock a public school for boys would be\nopened in a building that had been rented for the purpose by the\nmunicipal council. About the middle of the afternoon of the same day a\nman beat a little drum throughout all the streets of the town to call\nthe people out and the town clerk announced both in Spanish and in the\nnative language that this public school would begin at the time and\nplace mentioned above; that instruction would be free to all who came;\nthat the government would furnish all supplies; and that instruction\nwould be given in the English language. A native principal and\nassistants were employed and everything was ready to begin.\n\nThe official report of the result is as follows:\n    Boys' public school of Talisay, Negros, P. I., began November\n    4, 1901. Forty-three boys present at eight o'clock. Forty-one\n    of them knew \"good morning\" and \"good afternoon\" but do not\n    know the distinction between them. Two of them speak simple\n    Spanish. At eight forty-five, eight more, who had been\n    attending an early morning private school, came in together.\n\n    The books they brought were so varied and so different from\n    one another that it seemed impossible to bring any reasonable\n    degree of order out of such a chaos, and so, after struggling\n    vainly for about a week with the problem, the superintendent\n    by one fell stroke removed everything in use and put in a\n    uniform system, and from that day on the English language has\n    been the basis of instruction in the public schools of\n    Talisay. The work was of necessity very slow at first, but by\n    the end of a year two schools were going nicely and a number\n    of the brightest boys and girls had made really excellent\n    progress.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER V. - A \"BAILE.\"\n\n\nNot long after the arrival of our party at Bacalod we received an\ninvitation to a \"baile\" given in our honor by the inhabitants of\nSilay, a town some ten or twelve miles up the northern coast and one\nnoted for its social life. The invitation was accepted with pleasure,\nand about the middle of the afternoon on the day appointed we were\nclad in the immaculate white of the tropics and steaming away up the\ncoast on board a launch sent for our conveyance. Twilight was still\nlingering on the path of day when we anchored just off shore at the\ntown. A row-boat containing the officials of the city came out to meet\nus and, in due season, we were ushered into a spacious drawing-room\nfilled almost to overflowing with the \u00e9lite of the town. The \u00e9lite of\ntowns in the Philippines speak Spanish, and, as only one or two of our\nparty could at that time boast of more than a formal acquaintance with\nthe Castilian tongue, the exchange of ideas that evening between us\nand the Filipinos was of necessity not very rapid.\n\nThe necessity of easy communication between us was rendered somewhat\nless indispensable by the announcement of supper as soon as we were\nrested from our trip. When we had taken our places at the table a\nyoung Filipino about twenty-five years of age arose and gave a lengthy\ntoast to the recent union of the Philippines with the United States.\n\nBut as we Americans were unable to scale the dizzy heights of his\nclimaxes or sink to the depths of his pathos, we forewent the\npleasures of his oratory and turned our attention to the savory odor\nof lamb, chicken, and roast pig that came slyly stealing up our\nnostrils to send us nerve dispatches about the gastronomic delights of\nour not far distant future.\n\nAt last the toast was ended and the world-wide soup ushered in a long\ntrain of things good to eat, served in a style better fitted to the\ndelights of the appetite than to the formalities of dinners, for, as\nsoon as the pleasant task of one dish was completed by any one, the\nnext was served him at once regardless of the progress made by the\nothers at the table.\n\nThe last course was dulce. The new-comers to the Philippines will\nnot be long in making the acquaintance of this dish, and at all\nmeetings, both public and private, where eatables are served, it\nperforms an important part. It is anything sweet, and it may vary all\nthe way from an india-rubber-like black mixture of cocoanut milk and\ndirty sugar to a really toothsome and respectable confection. No\nmatter of what materials a dish is composed, just so long as it is\nsweet, it is dulce.\n\nAfter paying our respects to this last course, we arose from the table\nand entered a great rectangular room from the center of whose ceiling\nhung a large glass chandelier, a mass of shimmering crystals. In the\nchairs around the room were the wealth, the youth, and the beauty of\nthe town.\n\nThe first and also the last number of every Filipino dance of any\nformality is the \"rigodon.\" The dancers are arranged in a square, or\nquadrangle according to the number participating, and are then led\nthrough a tangled maze of figures that so utterly bewilders the novice\nthat he sinks into his chair at the end of the dance wondering how it\nall came to pass.\n\nWe Americans breathed a sigh of relief when the \"rigodon\" ended, and\nmustered fresh courage for social conquests in the waltz that was now\nbreathing forth from the trembling strings. My companion in the first\ndance had been the young lady by whose side I had sat at dinner. But\nit now became necessary to search for another, so I prudently waited\nto see how partners were chosen, and made no mistake when a few\nmoments later I faced one of the most luscious looking se\u00f1oritas on\nthe opposite side of the room and offered her my arm. My eyes must\nhave told the story that my lips could not utter in Spanish, for she\nsmiled upon me sweetly, arose, and put her hand upon my shoulder. My\narm encircled her waist and I began to waltz. Unfortunately my\ncompanion did not follow, but began to hop up and down in a manner\nmost distressing. Supposing the attack to be only temporary, I paused\nand, much to my relief, she soon showed signs of recovery; and in the\ncourse of time she came to a standstill looking up into my face in an\ninquiring sort of way, apparently wondering why St. Vitus had not paid\nhis respects to me also. A second attempt to follow the music met with\nresults similar to the first, and during the third attempt, which\nseemed to be trembling on the verge of a failure, St. Vitus let go my\ncompanion and seized me with such vigor that she, who was small even\nfor a Filipino, was gathered up bodily and taken around the room at\nsuch a pace that her toes touched the floor only at far distant\nintervals.\n\nAt this point my devotion to the shrine of Terpsichore ceased from\nforce of circumstances and I seated myself in one of the most\ncomfortable chairs in sight that I might carry out a previously formed\nplan to study the Filipino somewhat critically as he appears in\nsociety.\n\nThe first thing that impressed me as the dancers passed up and down\nthe room was the flash of diamonds. Nearly every woman in the room had\non a brooch that flashed the colors of the rainbow at every turn.\n\nAlmost all of them wore one or more rings that showed up brilliantly\nunder the chandelier. Many of the men too, especially the young men,\nwore gems that appeared to be exquisite. A closer inspection showed\nthat some of the gems had flaws and others were of a poor color, but\nno one would have denied that, taken as a whole, it was a really\nbeautiful display.\n\nThe dress of the ladies was richly colored. Many of their skirts were\nof silk covered with hand embroidered flowers, and their filmy pina\nwaists and broad collar pieces were rich with needle-work. They all\nwore a kind of heelless velvet slipper, very common as a dress shoe in\nthe Philippines, or high-heeled patent leather shoes with neatly\nfitting black stockings.\n\nThe men were dressed in white coats and white pantaloons or black\ncoats and white pantaloons. White shirts and collars, together with\nall sorts and styles of cravats and low-cut patent leather shoes with\nhighly colored socks completed their dress.\n\nIt was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money;\nthat they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a\ntable loaded with good things was a fact to which all of us were\nenthusiastic witnesses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VI. - A SKETCH OF LIFE IN THE PHILIPPINES.\n\n\nHouse-keeping in the Philippines presents some interesting phases. Our\nclub of American officials decided to run a mess, so we employed a\ncook and a house boy, then each of us provided himself with a personal\nservant, making a total of six servants for four men--it takes about\nthis proportion of servants to live in any sort of comfort in the\nPhilippines--and launched ourselves boldly upon the sea of domestic\neconomy. But there were shoals ahead of us, for the question of\nregulating servants is one of no small importance in the Philippines,\nand one of its most disadvantageous features is the long chain of\ndependents that usually attends it.\n\nWe gave the cooks so much a day with which to buy supplies in the\nlocal market, for our own table, making him render a daily list of\nexpenditures, and a fixed amount besides to purchase rice and fish for\nhimself and the other servants. Of course, if they wished to vary\ntheir diet and get chicken and fresh pork, which could be had at far\ndistant intervals, it was wholly a matter of their option, but the\nallowance was made on the basis of so much rice and fish a day for\neach. This allowance was about fifteen cents a day in Spanish coin per\nservant.\n\nThus far all was well. We had agreed to give the cook eight dollars a\nmonth in Spanish money, thinking that good wages would procure good\nservice, but the visions of affluence that floated before him on such\nfloods of wealth were so alluring that they drew him from the kitchen\nto the cooler veranda. In less than a week he had employed an\nassistant at four dollars a month; in less than another week that\nassistant had employed him an assistant at two dollars a month; in\nless than another week that assistant to the assistant had employed\nhim an assistant at the princely salary of fifty cents a month; and\nfrom fear that the chain of dependents would end only by our having\nthe whole Filipino race attached to our culinary force, we broke up\nhouse-keeping and went boarding again, choosing that as the less of\nthe two evils.\n\nOur house furnishings were almost wholly Philippine. The table ware\nand the food on the table came from the ends of the earth. The knives\nand forks were made in Germany, the plates were manufactured in\nEngland, the glass ware and table cloth, in the United States. The\noatmeal and flour came from the United States also. The butter came\nfrom Australia, the rice from China, the salt from Russia, and the\nother eatables from sources about as various as their separate names.\n\nSwitzerland furnished the condensed milk and Illinois the canned\ncream. Nearly all of the canned fruit bore labels from Spain.\n\nThus it can easily be seen that life in the Philippines, if lived\naccording to American ideals, is dependent upon a highly developed and\nhighly complex commerce. However, the difficulties of transportation\nand the restriction of large stocks of merchandise to Manila and some\nhalf a dozen other towns, make so great a difference between country\nlife and city life that a short comparison of the two will not be out\nof place, and life in Manila may well be taken as being fairly typical\nof the latter.\n\nLife in Manila is pleasant, but expensive. It is pleasant from the\nfact that it is not only the capital but also metropolis of the\narchipelago. Thus the combination of wealth and high official position\nhas given to Manila a society of the highest and most refined type.\n\nThe process of beautifying and improving the city which is constantly\ngoing on bids fair to give us at no distant day a city of which we may\nwell be proud.\n\nBut let him who intends living well in Manila on a small income bid\nfarewell at once to so idylic a dream, for it costs much to live well\nthere. In the city of Manila one can get almost anything he wishes,\nbut it must be paid for at the price it commands. Especially in the\ncase of eatables, this price is by no means small, because to the\nfirst cost of articles must in most cases be added the expense of\ndistant shipment from American, European, or Australian ports, and not\ninfrequently the cost of long refrigeration must also be taken into\nconsideration. But, expensive though it is, it is very pleasant to\nlive there and those who have once enjoyed it often wish again to\nquaff the cup of its delights.\n\nIn strong contrast to this pleasant life is the life of the quiet\nlittle hamlet away in the distant islands. Indeed, the Filipino from\nthe distant town, who by some good fortune has been to Manila, or, by\na coup de main, has studied in one of the Manila colleges, is looked\nup to in a true hero-worshiping attitude by all who either know him or\nhear of his fame. Life in such a place is one long state of harmless\ninactivity. Not a wave of trouble from the great outer world ever\ndisturbs its peaceful repose. One lounges forever in an air of\nindolent ease and extreme aversion to anything approaching what might\nbe called a respectable effort.\n\nOne arises in the morning about the time the sun's first rays silver\nthe top leaves of the cocoanut trees and then stirs around until nine\nor ten o'clock, when it is found expedient to avoid a further exposure\nto the sun. From then until about five o'clock in the afternoon it is\nbest to take things as they come, even though one of those things be a\nFilipino dinner. But then you may have your vehiclo attached to a\nyoung bull with a ring in his nose and go for a drive. If it is the\ndry season you will probably enjoy the drive unless you object to the\nfrequent clouds of dust swept along by the evening wind. If it is in\nthe rainy season your pleasure will depend to a considerable extent\nupon how wet you get; but, whether the season be wet or dry, your\npleasure will be regulated largely by the state of harmony existing\nbetween the driver and the bull.\n\nIn these quiet secluded nooks successive generations of Filipinos are\nborn, reared, grow old and die in an even chain of events broken only\nby the occasional erection of a new grass house on the identical spot\nwhere its predecessors have stood for ages. The son lives in the house\nof his father, cultivates the same few square feet of soil planted in\nedible roots, climbs the same cocoanut trees, follows the same winding\npath down to the stream, pounds rice in the same mortar and with the\nsame stick that his ancestors have used from time unremembered, and,\nin case of illness, curls up on a grass mat in a corner of the room\nuntil he dies or by some good fortune recovers. Beyond this narrow\nhorizon he never looks. So narrow and contracted is the life that the\nlanguages of two towns a few miles apart are so different that one\nwould scarcely recognize them as belonging to the same race of people.\n\nSuch are the two extremes of life in our new far Eastern provinces:\nthe one is active, progressive, and cosmopolitan; the other, inactive,\ndecadent, and narrow; but, whether one enjoys the first or endures the\nsecond, there comes to him after leaving a longing to lounge again in\ntropic airs and listen to the lullaby of the winds among the palms.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VII. - THE FILIPINO AT HOME.\n\n\nAs one enters a Filipino sitting-room for the first time, there is one\nfeature in the arrangement of the furniture that impresses itself upon\nhim at once, and it may be stated without fear of serious\ncontradiction that this same peculiar feature in its arrangement will\ncontinue to face him, as he enters different homes, about as certainly\nas he crosses the threshold.\n\nThe arrangement referred to is that of one large mirror, one settee,\nand some ten or a dozen chairs that appear to have had a certain\norderly affection for one another. The mirror is hung upon one of the\nlarge interior parts of the house about four feet above the floor. The\nwooden houses in the Philippines are built by setting large posts\nupright into the ground, extending into the air from twenty to thirty\nfeet. Cross timbers are fastened to these upright posts about eight or\nten feet above the ground and then not sawed off even with the posts,\nbut allowed to extend beyond them each way. The framework of the house\nis built upon these extending cross timbers, a style of building by\nwhich these large upright posts are left standing out on the inside of\nthe room from one to three feet from the walls. It is on that one of\nthese posts most nearly opposite the door that the mirror always finds\nits place. Immediately beneath the mirror is the settee; and the\nchairs are arranged in two parallel lines facing one another and at\nright angles with the ends of the settee. However odd this arrangement\nmay appear to one when he first enters a Filipino drawing-room, there\nare two things to be said in its favor. In the first place, it places\nyou face to face with the person with whom you are conversing so that\nyou can watch him,--a matter of no small moment in the Philippines. In\nthe next place, it enables you to give one of the young ladies a\nsheep's-eye in the mirror while the others present are left where\nMoses was in our much abused conundrum.\n\nThe size of the residence and the quality of its furnishings depends\nupon the wealth of the owner. But there is so vast a difference\nbetween the mode of life of the highest class and the tao, or lowest\nclass, that it is well to speak of them separately, and the great\nmiddle class of Filipinos can easily be imagined to occupy the\nintervening ground.\n\nThe rich Filipino's house is usually of wood built upon a wall of\nstone or brick from ten to fifteen feet high. The floors are kept\nhighly polished in his hallway, dressing-room, and bed-rooms. There\nare, of course, no fire-places in any of the rooms, but on some\noccasions something is needed to dry the rain-soaked atmosphere, for\neven in the dry season it has been seen to rain for five successive\ndays and nights without the cessation of a moment.\n\nA long chain of dependents is attached to the household of the rich\nFilipino. The master has his special body servant to be present at all\ntimes to do his master's bidding, in short, to be the visible\nmechanism of his master's volition. So, too, the lady of the house has\nher servant woman to do the slightest bidding of her ladyship. Then\nthere is the cook who is almost invariably a man, a house boy or two,\nand the coachman. These functionaries, with their assistants and\nassistants to the assistants, together with a servant or two for the\nexclusive service of the children, complete the economic household.\n\nSuch a family has an abundance of rice and wheat bread, also of\nchicken and fish with occasional fresh beef. They have also a good\ndeal of dulce. They regularly serve wine and frequently serve beer\non their tables.\n\nIn strong contrast with this mode of life is that of the tao. His\ndiet consists almost wholly of rice and small uncleaned fish boiled\ntogether. As a rule knife, fork, plate, and spoon find no place in his\nhousehold. The rice and fish are boiled in a pot and then allowed to\ncool in the same vessel or poured out to cool in a large earthen or\nwooden bowl. Then Mr. Tao together with Mrs. Tao and all the young\nTaos squat on their heels around the mixture and satisfy that\nintangible thing called the appetite. They do not use chop sticks as\nthe Chinese do, but the rice and fish are caught in a hollow formed by\nthe first three fingers of the right hand. The thumb is then placed\nbehind the mass. It is raised up and poised before the mouth, with a\nskill coming from the evolution of ages, when a contraction of the\nmuscles of the thumb throws the mass into the mouth with a skill that\nis marvelous to any but a Filipino. To judge from the most reliable\ninformation, the poorest class do not have an abundance of food,\nalthough it would seem that such a condition of things would be\nwell-nigh impossible. However, in a census of one hundred school\nchildren there were found six boys and four girls who declared that\nthey had never had enough to eat, and the native teacher stated that\nthis was probably true.\n\nThe wide gulf between the tao and the rich man is filled by the\ngreat middle class of Filipinos.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VIII. - VISIT TO A LEPER COLONY.\n\n\nNot far from our town was a leper colony and the first Saturday that\ncould be spared was set aside for a trip to the place. It happened\nthat none of the other Americans were at leisure on this particular\nmorning, but, rather then delay the trip or miss it altogether, the\nwriter, armed with a revolver, started out alone.\n\nThe road had been described so accurately by one who was supposed to\nknow it that it was deemed well-nigh impossible to miss the way. The\nmain highway was followed to the point where the by-path supposed to\nlead to the settlement turned off through some bamboo thickets and a\nlow tropical wood. This path led straight away towards the sea-coast\nwhere the houses of the colony were said to stand in a cocoanut grove\nby the beach.\n\nUpon arriving at the settlement, a very inhospitable reception was\nreceived from a mangy cur that growled and showed a very uninviting\nset of sharp, white teeth behind his snarling lips. The growling of\nthe dog had attracted the attention of an old man who, with age-bent\nback, was pounding rice in a mortar about fifty yards away. He turned\nslowly around and, upon seeing an intruder into the primitive quiet of\nthe place, gave a sharp, far-reaching call. The sound had scarcely\nrung through the grove when from about a dozen of the little grass\nhouses dotted here and there fifteen or twenty men armed with bolos\ncame out and gathered around the old man. A sense of my danger flashed\nupon me. Three miles from town and alone in a tropical jungle, I could\nbe almost instantly overcome by this band of bolo-men, and the only\nreport that would ever reach my people would be that I had\n\"disappeared.\" Of course, attack was by no means certain, but the\npotentiality of the situation was thrilling. A drawn revolver and the\ngleaming of its shining barrel had the effect of stopping the men, who\nseemed to be hesitating as to a course of action, until a somewhat\ndignified retreat was made to an open space in the rear from where a\nless dignified and a more hasty retreat began which did not stop short\nof Bacalod.\n\nEnough had been seen, however, even in this short visit, to give\nconvincing proof that the settlement visited was no colony of lepers;\nso, that afternoon two servant boys being taken as guides and\ninterpreters, another attempt was made to reach the goal desired.\n\nThis attempt was successful, and, after about two hours of walking, a\nlittle cluster of grass huts snugly hidden by the sea-coast came into\nview. As we approached, one would have thought it a gala-day. Some few\nchildren, apparently from six to thirteen years of age, almost wholly\nnude, were romping and playing in the open space around which the huts\nstood, and no one would ever have thought that any cloud so horrible\nas leprosy could hover over a place apparently so happy.\n\nBy the side of the path as we passed was a man and his wife setting\nout potato plants. His hands were so puffed and his fingers so short\nthat he could scarcely use them, but he was working along as best he\ncould. His wife's feet were so swollen and twisted that she walked\nonly with the greatest difficulty. We passed them by and entered the\nopen space above referred to.\n\nThe children now saw us, and those of them who could darted away like\nfrightened rabbits, each to his own burrow. An old man who was sitting\nin the warm afternoon sun on the little bamboo platform before his hut\nwas aroused from his lethargic repose by the scampering away of the\nchildren. He arose, trembling upon his tottering limbs, all drawn and\ntwisted, and hobbled away into his hut.\n\nThe children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at\nthe doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of\nthe settlement. In a few moments we were surrounded by a circle of\nhuman beings at once so repulsive and so pitiable that its graphic\nvividness can never be accurately portrayed.\n\nThe old man referred to above, having put on a pair of snow-white\npantaloons, appeared now at the doorway of his hut, followed a few\nmoments later by his wife who had evidently clothed herself in the\nbest raiment she had. At a call from the old man, all the men, women,\nand children in the settlement came out of their huts and stood in a\nline before us. The old man was spokesman and in his native visayan\ntongue made a heart-rending appeal for aid which we were powerless to\ngive. Attention was called to a leper woman, apparently about\ntwenty-five years of age, whose face had been attacked by the disease\nand whose appearance was truly pathetic. Upon her hip was a child\nabout a year and a half old and, strange to say, the child showed as\nyet no signs whatever of the disease.\n\nWhat an indissoluble enigma is life! Here in a little cluster of grass\nhuts in a secluded nook of a secluded island of an all but secluded\narchipelago was gathered together a little community of wretched\nnatives, driven by their loathsomeness from association with others\neven of the same half-savage race. Yet here, men and women loved and\nwere married, by mutual trust if not by law, and children were born of\nthe union to live forever under the unspeakable horror that\novershadowed the unfortunate parents. Love, hatred, sorrow, and\njoy--every passion that enters into the complex structure of the human\nheart even here, in this scene of sadness and despair, was playing\napparently as freely as where misfortune and disease had never crossed\nthe portals of life.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER IX. - A \"HIKE.\"\n\n\nWe were lounging lazily in our hammocks at Jimamaylan one evening in\nApril. Supper was just ended, and the soldiers in the post were\ncollected in groups here and there spinning yarns to pass away the\ntime, when a Filipino clad only in a loin cloth came down the street\nat a steadily swinging run and stopped in front of the sentry. He\nbrought the announcement that a band of ladrones had just burned a\nsugar mill and were advancing to sack a barrio about fifteen miles\naway.\n\nThe invitation of the commanding officer to go on a \"hike\" was eagerly\naccepted, and, in ten minutes after the message was given, the troops\nwere on the march followed by two adventurous pedagogues.\n\nDarkness was just closing in as we left the town, but a resplendent\ntropic moon soon made the night almost as brilliant as the day. The\ntrail we followed led over rough and rocky country. Sometimes for a\ndistance of a mile or more we passed over barren wastes of volcanic\nslag poured out in anger by some peak whose convulsions have long\nsince ceased. Again we would descend into a tropical jungle from the\ndense foliage of which the ladrones could have leaped at any moment,\nhad they known of our coming, and annihilated our little band. We\nforded rapid streams with the water at our breasts, and halted only\nonce in that rapid march of fifteen miles.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the town we met a man who was standing\nguard against a surprise by the ladrones. Nothing could well have been\nmuch more grotesque and nothing could much better illustrate the\nabsolutely primitive condition of the Filipinos in the interior of the\nislands than the appearance of this guard. A pair of knee pants, a\nconical grass hat, and a hemp shirt formed his entire apparel. A long\nflat wooden shield, a bolo, and a long bamboo spear with a sharp,\nflat, iron point, completed his equipment for battle.\n\nHere stood the first and the twentieth centuries side by side. The\nFilipino who had advanced only a stage beyond the condition of\nprimitive man with his knife, spear, and wooden shield, stood side by\nside with the American soldier, a representative of modern life with\nhis magazine rifle, his canteen, his knapsack,--with every article of\nhis clothing made to give him the highest possible efficiency as the\nunit of a military organization.\n\nA few yards farther on we met another guard equipped similarly to the\nfirst. Upon reaching the town, news had just been received that a\ndetachment of troops from another post had intercepted the ladrones\nand fought a skirmish with them. The ladrones had escaped and we set\nout in pursuit of them on a chase wilder than a Quixotic dream. We\nwound our way into the mountains behind the town, inquiring at every\ngrass hut we passed whether the band of ladrones had passed that way,\nbut only once was even a trace of them found. Then it was learned that\nat a certain place they had separated into groups of three or four and\ngone glimmering through the dream of things that were. This place was\nin a secluded nook of the mountains where in years gone by some\nadventurous Spaniard had erected a primitive water mill to grind his\nsugar-cane. We had now marched about twenty miles and the feet of the\npedagogues were a mass of blisters. They had reached the point where\nthat form of military maneuvering called \"hiking\" ceased to possess\nany alluring charms. So a native was persuaded to come out of his lone\nmountain hut and hitch up his carabao and cart. He was then made to\nget on the carabao's back, while the aforesaid pedagogues lay down on\nthe sugar-cane pulp that had been put into the body of the cart, and\nthe driver was instructed to start for the post we had left hours\nbefore, and not to stop until he got there. Being uncertain but that\nsome of the ladrones would learn of our having left the body of troops\nand would try the metal of our steel, we at first agreed that neither\nof us should go to sleep, but it was later decided that probably the\ndriver had no greater desire to cross the Styx than his passengers had\nand that in case of danger he would awaken us, so both took a revolver\nin each hand, stretched out supinely and went to sleep.\n\nSuch a sleep! The rough jolting of the cart over an almost impassable\nroad was never enough to break the spell of slumber. When we awoke the\nblazing tropic sun was past the midday mark of morning, shining full\ninto our unprotected and well-nigh blistered faces.\n\nA pack of dogs were heralding our approach to a little village at the\nfoot of the mountains where ponies were procured to take us back to\nthe post."

                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently\nno time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth dimension of Space\nas a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house\nbecame quite quiet.\n\nOn reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up\nagainst a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realize\nhis position. Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\nhundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the\nDowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone\ninto hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains on\none of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who\nhad been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr\nto nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair\nby the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six\nweeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become\nreconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that\nnotorious sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible\nnight when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his\ndressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and\nconfessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox\nout of \u00a350,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card, and swore that\nthe ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back\nto him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because\nhe had seen a green hand tapping at the window-pane, to the beautiful\nLady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round\nher throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin,\nand who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of the\nKing's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he went\nover his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as\nhe recalled to mind his last appearance as \"Red Reuben, or the Strangled\nBabe,\" his d\u00e9but as \"Guant Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,\"\n\nand the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely\nplaying ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And\nafter all this some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him\nthe Rising Sun Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite\nunbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever been treated in this\nmanner. Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance, and remained till\ndaylight in an attitude of deep thought.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III\n\n\nThe next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed\nthe ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. \"I have\nno wish,\" he said, \"to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say\nthat, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,\"--a very just remark,\nat which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.\n\n\"Upon the other hand,\" he continued, \"if he really declines to use the\nRising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him. It\nwould be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside\nthe bedrooms.\"\n\nFor the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the\nblood-stain on the library floor. This certainly was very strange, as\nthe door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept\nclosely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a\ngood deal of comment. Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red,\nthen it would be vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came\ndown for family prayers, according to the simple rites of the Free\nAmerican Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright\nemerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party\nvery much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening. The\nonly person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia, who,\nfor some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the\nsight of the blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was\nemerald-green.\n\nThe second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in\nthe hall. Rushing down-stairs, they found that a large suit of old\narmour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone\nfloor, while seated in a high-backed chair was the Canterville ghost,\nrubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face. The\ntwins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged\ntwo pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained\nby long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United\nStates Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in\naccordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost\nstarted up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a\nmist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so\nleaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase\nhe recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of\ndemoniac laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely\nuseful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single\nnight, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French\ngovernesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly\nlaughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and\nrang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door\nopened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown. \"I am\nafraid you are far from well,\" she said, \"and have brought you a bottle\nof Doctor Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a\nmost excellent remedy.\" The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at\nonce to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an\naccomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family\ndoctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's\nuncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps,\nhowever, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself\nwith becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep\nchurchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.\n\nOn reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the\nmost violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross\nmaterialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what\nreally distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit\nof mail. He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by\nthe sight of a Spectre in armour, if for no more sensible reason, at\nleast out of respect for their natural poet Longfellow, over whose\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\nhour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides it was his own suit.\n\nHe had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament, and had\nbeen highly complimented on it by no less a person than the Virgin Queen\nherself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely overpowered\nby the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen\nheavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees severely, and\nbruising the knuckles of his right hand.\n\nFor some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of\nhis room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.\n\nHowever, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to\nmake a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his\nfamily. He selected Friday, August 17th, for his appearance, and spent\nmost of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in\nfavour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet\nfrilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards evening a\nviolent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was\njust such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to\nmake his way quietly to Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the\nfoot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\nof low music. He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville\nblood-stain by means of Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent. Having reduced\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and\nhis wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead,\nwhile he hissed into her trembling husband's ear the awful secrets of\nthe charnel-house. With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made\nup his mind. She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and\ngentle. A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more\nthan sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the\ncounterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins, he was quite\ndetermined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be done was, of\ncourse, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling\nsensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each\nother, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse,\ntill they became paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw off the\nwinding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white, bleached bones and\none rolling eyeball, in the character of \"Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's\nSkeleton,\" a r\u00f4le in which he had on more than one occasion produced a\ngreat effect, and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of\n\"Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.\"\n\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the\nlight-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves\nbefore they retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still,\nand, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the\nwindow-panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family\nslept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\ncould hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States. He\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his\nmurdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like\nan evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.\n\nOnce he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only\nthe baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange\nsixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\nin the midnight air. Finally he reached the corner of the passage that\nled to luckless Washington's room. For a moment he paused there, the\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's\nshroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was\ncome. He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had\nhe done so than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid\nhis blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was\nstanding a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous\nas a madman's dream! Its head was bald and burnished; its face round,\nand fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\nfeatures into an eternal grin. From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\nlight, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like\nto his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form. On its breast\nwas a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of\nshame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime,\nand, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\n\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's\njack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler. Once in the\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small\npallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes. After a time, however,\nthe brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to\ngo and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight. Accordingly,\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling\nthat, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid\nof his new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins. On reaching\nthe spot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had\nevidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from\nits hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it\nwas leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable\nattitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his\nhorror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a\nrecumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity\nbed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow\nturnip lying at his feet! Unable to understand this curious\ntransformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there,\nin the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:--\n        +------------------------------------+\n        |         YE OTIS GHOSTE             |\n        | Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook, |\n        |    Beware of Ye Imitationes.       |\n        |   All others are counterfeite.     |\n        +------------------------------------+\nThe whole thing flashed across him. He had been tricked, foiled, and\nout-witted! The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his\ntoothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his\nhead, swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\nschool, that, when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds\nof blood would be wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.\n\nHardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of\na distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh,\nand waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\nreason, did not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back\nto his room, thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose. There he\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was\nexceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which this oath\nhad been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second time. \"Perdition\nseize the naughty fowl,\" he muttered, \"I have seen the day when, with my\nstout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow\nfor me an 'twere in death!\" He then retired to a comfortable lead\ncoffin, and stayed there till evening.\n\n\nCHAPTER: IV\n\n\nThe next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were\ncompletely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five\ndays he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point\nof the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want\nit, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a\nlow, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating\nthe symbolic value of sensuous phenomena. The question of phantasmic\napparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a\ndifferent matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large\noriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every month, and he\ndid not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is\nquite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand,\nhe was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.\n\nFor the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as\nusual between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible\nprecaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots,\ntrod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large\nblack velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for\noiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good\ndeal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of\nprotection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he\nslipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a\nlittle humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see\nthat there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a\ncertain degree, it served his purpose. Still in spite of everything he\nwas not left unmolested. Strings were continually being stretched across\nthe corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion,\nwhile dressed for the part of \"Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley\nWoods,\" he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide,\nwhich the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry\nChamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged\nhim, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and\nsocial position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the\nnext night in his celebrated character of \"Reckless Rupert, or the\nHeadless Earl.\"\n\nHe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in\nfact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means\nof it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord\nCanterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome\nJack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\ndown the terrace at twilight. Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\nLord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken\nheart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it\nhad been a great success. It was, however an extremely difficult\n\"make-up,\" if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more\nscientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three\nhours to make his preparations. At last everything was ready, and he was\nvery pleased with his appearance. The big leather riding-boots that went\nwith the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\nfind one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite\nsatisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting\nand crept down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins,\nwhich I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of\nthe colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make\nan effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water\nfell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his\nleft shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed. The shock to his\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\ncould go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold. The only\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\nhad not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences\nmight have been very serious.\n\nHe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,\nand contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in\nlist slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\ndraughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the\ntwins. The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September. He\nhad gone down-stairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that\nthere, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing\nhimself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of\nthe United States Minister and his wife which had now taken the place of\nthe Canterville family pictures. He was simply but neatly clad in a long\nshroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip\nof yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In\nfact, he was dressed for the character of \"Jonas the Graveless, or the\nCorpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,\" one of his most remarkable\nimpersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to\nremember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their\nneighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a quarter-past two o'clock in\nthe morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring. As\nhe was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any\ntraces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a\ndark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads,\nand shrieked out \"BOO!\" in his ear.\n\nSeized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural,\nhe rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him\nthere with the big garden-syringe, and being thus hemmed in by his\nenemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the\ngreat iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to\nmake his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own\nroom in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.\n\nAfter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins\nlay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\nservants, but it was of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings\nwere so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed\nhis great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had\nbeen engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized a wonderful\nclam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse\neuchre, poker, and other American national games, and Virginia rode\nabout the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire,\nwho had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville\nChase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in\nfact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who,\nin reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best\ncongratulations to the Minister's worthy wife.\n\nThe Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the\nhouse, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let\nmatters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the\nyoung Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had\nonce bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice\nwith the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the\nfloor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state that, though\nhe lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but\n\"Double Sixes.\" The story was well known at the time, though, of course,\nout of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt\nwas made to hush it up, and a full account of all the circumstances\nconnected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle's\nRecollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends. The ghost, then,\nwas naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence\nover the Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his\nown first cousin having been married en secondes noces to the Sieur de\nBulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are\nlineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to\nVirginia's little lover in his celebrated impersonation of \"The Vampire\nMonk, or the Bloodless Benedictine,\" a performance so horrible that when\nold Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in\nthe year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which\nculminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after\ndisinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and\nleaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment,\nhowever, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the\nlittle Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal\nBedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.\n\n\nCHAPTER: V\n\n\nA few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out\nriding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting\nthrough a hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go\nup by the back staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past\nthe Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied\nshe saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother's maid, who\nsometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend\nher habit. To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville\nGhost himself! He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of\nthe yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing\nmadly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his hand, and his\nwhole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so forlorn, and so\nmuch out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea\nhad been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity,\nand determined to try and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so\ndeep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she\nspoke to him.\n\n\"I am so sorry for you,\" she said, \"but my brothers are going back to\nEton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy\nyou.\"\n\n\"It is absurd asking me to behave myself,\" he answered, looking round in\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,\n\"quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and\nwalk about at night, if that is what you mean. It is my only reason for\nexisting.\"\n\n\"It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very\nwicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had\nkilled your wife.\"\n\n\"Well, I quite admit it,\" said the Ghost, petulantly, \"but it was a\npurely family matter, and concerned no one else.\"\n\n\"It is very wrong to kill any one,\" said Virginia, who at times had a\nsweet puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.\n\n\"Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very\nplain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about\ncookery. Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent\npricket, and do you know how she had it sent to table? However, it is\nno matter now, for it is all over, and I don't think it was very nice of\nher brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.\"\n\n\"Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost--I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry? I\nhave a sandwich in my case. Would you like it?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you,\nall the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\nvulgar, dishonest family.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Virginia, stamping her foot, \"it is you who are rude, and\nhorrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the\npaints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain\nin the library. First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and\nI couldn't do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the\nchrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese\nwhite, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing\nto look at, and not at all easy to paint. I never told on you, though I\nwas very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for\nwho ever heard of emerald-green blood?\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" said the Ghost, rather meekly, \"what was I to do? It is\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother\nbegan it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I\nshould not have your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of\ntaste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest\nin England; but I know you Americans don't care for things of this\nkind.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\nand improve your mind. My father will be only too happy to give you a\nfree passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind,\nthere will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are\nall Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\nhave a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family ghost.\"\n\n\"I don't think I should like America.\"\n\n\"I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,\" said Virginia,\nsatirically.\n\n\"No ruins! no curiosities!\" answered the Ghost; \"you have your navy and\nyour manners.\"\n\n\"Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week's\nholiday.\"\n\n\"Please don't go, Miss Virginia,\" he cried; \"I am so lonely and so\nunhappy, and I really don't know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I\ncannot.\"\n\n\"That's quite absurd! You have merely to go to bed and blow out the\ncandle. It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\nchurch, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why, even\nbabies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.\"\n\n\"I have not slept for three hundred years,\" he said sadly, and\nVirginia's beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; \"for three hundred\nyears I have not slept, and I am so tired.\"\n\nVirginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like\nrose-leaves. She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked\nup into his old withered face.\n\n\"Poor, poor Ghost,\" she murmured; \"have you no place where you can\nsleep?\"\n\n\"Far away beyond the pine-woods,\" he answered, in a low, dreamy voice,\n\"there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\nsings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold crystal\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\nsleepers.\"\n\nVirginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\n\n\"You mean the Garden of Death,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth,\nwith the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have\nno yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at\npeace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of death's\nhouse, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death\nis.\"\n\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\nthere was silence. She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\n\nThen the ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of\nthe wind.\n\n\"Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?\"\n\n\"Oh, often,\" cried the little girl, looking up; \"I know it quite well.\n\nIt is painted in curious black letters, and is difficult to read. There\nare only six lines:\n    \"'When a golden girl can win\n    Prayer from out the lips of sin,\n    When the barren almond bears,\n    And a little child gives away its tears,\n    Then shall all the house be still\n    And peace come to Canterville.'\n\n\"But I don't know what they mean.\"\n\n\"They mean,\" he said, sadly, \"that you must weep with me for my sins,\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle,\nthe angel of death will have mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\ncannot prevail.\"\n\nVirginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair\nas he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes. \"I am not afraid,\" she said\nfirmly, \"and I will ask the angel to have mercy on you.\"\n\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as\nhe led her across the dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were\nbroidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back. \"Go back! little Virginia,\"\n\nthey cried, \"go back!\" but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly,\nand she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails\nand goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and\nmurmured, \"Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,\"\n\nbut the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When\nthey reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she\ncould not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly\nfading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A\nbitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her\ndress. \"Quick, quick,\" cried the Ghost, \"or it will be too late,\" and\nin a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry\nChamber was empty.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VI\n\n\nAbout ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not\ncome down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia\nanywhere. As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\nevening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all\nalarmed at first, but when six o'clock struck, and Virginia did not\nappear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for\nher, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house. At\nhalf-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\nof their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of\nexcitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly\nremembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies\npermission to camp in the park. He accordingly at once set off for\nBlackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son\nand two of the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire, who was\nperfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too,\nbut Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a\nscuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gipsies had\ngone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as\nthe fire was still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.\n\nHaving sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran\nhome, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the\ncounty, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been\nkidnapped by tramps or gipsies. He then ordered his horse to be brought\nround, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down\nto dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with a groom. He had hardly,\nhowever, gone a couple of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after\nhim, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with\nhis face very flushed, and no hat. \"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,\" gasped\nout the boy, \"but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.\n\nPlease don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year,\nthere would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me back,\nwill you? I can't go! I won't go!\"\n\nThe Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace,\nand was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down\nfrom his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, \"Well,\nCecil, if you won't go back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must\nget you a hat at Ascot.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!\" cried the little Duke, laughing,\nand they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of\nthe station-master if any one answering to the description of Virginia\nhad been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her. The\nstation-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him\nthat a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a\nhat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his\nshutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away,\nwhich he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as there was a\nlarge common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman, but\ncould get no information from him, and, after riding all over the\ncommon, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase\nabout eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found\nWashington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with\nlanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest trace of\nVirginia had been discovered. The gipsies had been caught on Brockley\nmeadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they should be late. Indeed, they had\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's disappearance, as they\nwere very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his\npark, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search.\n\nThe carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone\nover, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any\nrate, Virginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest\ndepression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they\nfound a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\nwas poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and\nhaving her forehead bathed with eau de cologne by the old housekeeper.\n\nMr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up\nsupper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one\nspoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very\nfond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the\nentreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that\nnothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in\nthe morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down\nimmediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight\nbegan to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded\nthey heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder\nshook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a\npanel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out\non the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her\nhand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs.\nOtis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with\nviolent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.\n\n\"Good heavens! child, where have you been?\" said Mr. Otis, rather\nangrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them.\n\n\"Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and\nyour mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these\npractical jokes any more.\"\n\n\"Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!\" shrieked the twins, as they\ncapered about.\n\n\"My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side\nagain,\" murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair.\n\n\"Papa,\" said Virginia, quietly, \"I have been with the Ghost. He is dead,\nand you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was\nreally sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of\nbeautiful jewels before he died.\"\n\nThe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave\nand serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a\nlighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they\ncame to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia\ntouched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves\nin a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated\nwindow. Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was\na gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone\nfloor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers\nan old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its\nreach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was\ncovered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but\na pile of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding\nher little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the\nparty looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\ndisclosed to them.\n\n\"Hallo!\" suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out\nof the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\nsituated. \"Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.\"\n\n\"God has forgiven him,\" said Virginia, gravely, as she rose to her feet,\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.\n\n\"What an angel you are!\" cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round\nher neck, and kissed her.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VII\n\n\nFour days after these curious incidents, a funeral started from\nCanterville Chase at about eleven o'clock at night. The hearse was drawn\nby eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\nnodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\npurple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville\ncoat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\nservants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully\nimpressive. Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up\nspecially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first\ncarriage along with little Virginia. Then came the United States\nMinister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the\nlast carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had\nbeen frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she\nhad a right to see the last of him. A deep grave had been dug in the\ncorner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service\nwas read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, the servants, according to an old custom\nobserved in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as\nthe coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward,\nand laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms. As\nshe did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its\nsilent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a\nnightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of the\nGarden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a\nword during the drive home.\n\nThe next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given\nto Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby\nnecklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen\nof sixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis\nfelt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"I know that in this country mortmain is held to\napply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that\nthese jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg\nyou, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you\nunder certain strange conditions. As for my daughter, she is merely a\nchild, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such\nappurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I\nmay say, is no mean authority upon Art,--having had the privilege of\nspending several winters in Boston when she was a girl,--that these gems\nare of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\nprice. Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you\nwill recognize how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\nin the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such\nvain gauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\nBritish aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who\nhave been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles\nof Republican simplicity. Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box, as a memento of\nyour unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is extremely old, and\nconsequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to\ncomply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good deal\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with medi\u00e6valism\nin any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was\nborn in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned\nfrom a trip to Athens.\"\n\nLord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister's speech,\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile,\nand when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\nsaid: \"My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky\nancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are\nmuch indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck. The jewels\nare clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough\nto take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave\nin a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. As for their being\nheirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or\nlegal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite\nunknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and\nwhen Miss Virginia grows up, I dare say she will be pleased to have\npretty things to wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the\nfurniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to\nthe ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity\nSir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he\nwas really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase.\"\n\nMr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville's refusal, and\nbegged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was\nquite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to\nretain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of\n1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's first\ndrawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the\nuniversal theme of admiration. For Virginia received the coronet, which\nis the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her\nboy-lover as soon as he came of age. They were both so charming, and\nthey loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the\nmatch, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch\nthe Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less\nthan three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to\nsay, Mr. Otis himself. Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke\npersonally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his\nown words, \"was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating\ninfluences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of\nRepublican simplicity should be forgotten.\" His objections, however,\nwere completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the\naisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his\narm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of\nEngland.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to\nCanterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over\nin the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods. There had\nbeen a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir\nSimon's tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it\nsimply the initials of the old gentleman's name, and the verse from the\nlibrary window. The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses,\nwhich she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for\nsome time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There\nthe Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her\nfeet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly\nhe threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her,\n\"Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.\"\n\n\"Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have,\" he answered, smiling, \"you have never told me what\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.\"\n\n\"I have never told any one, Cecil,\" said Virginia, gravely.\n\n\"I know that, but you might tell me.\"\n\n\"Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you. Poor Sir Simon! I owe\nhim a great deal. Yes, don't laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see\nwhat Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than\nboth.\"\n\nThe Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.\n\n\"You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,\" he murmured.\n\n\"You have always had that, Cecil.\"\n\n\"And you will tell our children some day, won't you?\"\n\nVirginia blushed.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.\n\nYet Millet would have us understand that in spite of this, the\nshepherd is performing a duty to humanity not to be underrated. The\nsheep he has so carefully and conscientiously reared will form food\nto-morrow for many a hungry town-dweller. Further, he would have us\nfollow the peasant as he closes the pen for the night and traces his\ntired steps towards his simple home in the village. The frugal and\nhard-earned meal, prepared for him by his wife, who like himself has\nhad her share of duties to occupy her during the day, is partaken of\nsurrounded by a hungry and joyous group of children. Such themes\nsuggested by the simplicity of his own life appealed to him with\nirresistible force, and it is in their portrayal that his greatness is\nmanifested.\n\nPerhaps no season of the year presented the same attraction for Millet\nas the spring. The period when all the earth after its long winter\nsleep is about to waken into new life seems to have always been a\nsource of inspiration to him. In \"The Sower\" he emphasises the fact\nthat the fruits of the harvest are not to be had without due labour\nbeing expended upon the earth. The sloping field, barren of\nvegetation, and crowned at the top with a small clump of trees, is\nbeing broken up by the distant plough drawn by two horses and guided\nby a peasant. The latter figure is one of the noblest of Millet's\ncreations. By his strained and ever-attentive attitude, by his\ncontinuous tramp over the rough and broken ground, he shows us the\nmonotony of his toil. He crosses the field in one direction, only to\nreturn at an interval of a few feet. In the foreground we have the\nsower, a middle-aged man of typical peasant type, on whose left side a\nbag of seeds is slung. With automatic precision he withdraws a\nhandful, and strews it into the furrows open to receive it. So long as\nhe continues in the same track his labour will be well performed, and\nhence his task is just as monotonous as that of his fellow-worker\nhigher up in the field. The silhouetting of these two figures against\nthe light is symbolical of the labour to be expended in life before\nresults are forthcoming.\n\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that in considering the works of\nMillet, one must not judge him from the standpoint of a mere painter.\n\nHis brush is only the means to an end, and by its means he is enabled\nto bring the fruits of his philosophic observation before us in\npermanent form. It has been charged against the \"Angelus\" that it was\nnot a remarkably fine piece of painting, that many a young artist of\nthe present generation is infinitely better equipped, technically\nspeaking, than the master who wrought this celebrated canvas. This may\nin a measure be true, but it must never be forgotten that Millet\nbrought into play exactly the means which could illustrate his meaning\nin the clearest terms. He had not intended, in painting such a\npicture, to produce a work which would astonish his fellow artists\nwith its brilliancy of handling or magnificence of colour. He wanted\nto make the beholder forget the painter and absorb the lesson. This\nquality runs right through the art of Millet, and it is from this\nstandpoint that we are obliged to weigh his merits.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE\n\n\nJean Fran\u00e7ois Millet was born on October 4, 1814, that is at the\nperiod when French art, at any rate as far as landscape painting is\nconcerned, had reached its lowest ebb. Throughout the eighteenth\ncentury the landscape painter had been hard put to make a living. The\ntaste of connoisseurs throughout the century had been for portraits\nand interiors, or for those numerous pastoral subjects which were\ncarried out with so much decorative charm by such men as Watteau and\nBoucher. Such landscape painting as existed was of the type\npopularised by Vernet; it was built upon a curious mixture of Italian\ninfluence coming from Panini and Salvator Rosa. The only evidence of\nrevolt against such a state of affairs we find in the works of Hubert\nRobert and Moreau. These two, and more especially would I direct the\nreader's attention to the latter, struggled hard to break down the\nconventionalities of the time. They endeavoured to infuse some sense\nof atmosphere into their pictures, and whilst frequently their trees\nand figures are painfully formal, they yet stand alone in the French\nschool as the pioneers of a phase of art which was to attain its\nzenith in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBut after the Revolution, and during the whole of the time that France\nwas under the domination of Napoleon, very rigid principles indeed\nwere enforced with regard to the direction that art should take. The\ninnovation which had its commencement in the reign of Louis XVI. swept\neverything before it as it gained force. Classical art and traditions\ndominated the whole French school, and no artist, however great his\nreputation, attempted for many years to swim against the stream. In\nspite of the principles of liberty and equality which were claimed for\nall under the new r\u00e9gime, a terribly strict eye was kept upon any\ninnovations which might break out in the form of a naturalistic art.\n\nThe directors of this new movement failed to see that the conditions\nwhich had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed\naway, and that the latter's supremacy was due to the fact that their\nproductions were symbolical of the loftiest thoughts of their own\nepoch. The art which expresses the ambitions and noblest thoughts of\nits time will alone endure. These expressions are not applicable to\nany other condition than those which called them forth, and hence in\nattempting to purify the rococo which had existed up to the middle of\nthe eighteenth century, by a return to classical traditions, they were\nonly copying that which their predecessors had done, and in so doing\nleft us without any original expression of their own time.\n\nInto such a condition of affairs was Millet born, and he was numbered\namongst that little band of men which included Rousseau, Corot, Dupr\u00e9,\nDiaz, and Daumier, who were to lay the foundations of the modern\nnaturalistic school. At the outset it was seemingly a hopeless\nstruggle they undertook; a struggle against prejudice and influence\nwhich was only to be brought to a victorious culmination after years\nof struggle and disappointment. Of this little band, Millet was\nperhaps the best equipped for the privations which were necessary. He\ncame of a peasant stock who inhabited Gruchy, a small village\nsituated in the commune of Gr\u00e9ville, close to Cherbourg. Grouped\nunderneath the humble roof was the grandmother, who had been left a\nwidow fifteen years before; her son, Jean Louis Nicolas Millet, and\nhis wife and eight children, of which our artist was the second. His\ngrandmother appears to have been a pious old lady, whose chief delight\nwas in her grandchildren, to whom she taught those religious\nprinciples which stood them in good stead in after life. We are told\nthat Millet's father possessed a force of character one does not often\nfind amongst men in his rank of life. He was of a contemplative\ndisposition, and had a keenly developed feeling for natural beauty. He\npossessed moreover a keen appreciation of music, which unfortunately\nhe does not appear to have had much opportunity of cultivating. His\nwife was an excellent housewife and of a religious turn of mind. The\nhouse they occupied, situated quite a short distance from the sea, was\nplaced in a tract of country which, whilst it had rugged and\npicturesque features, was not of a nature which would yield\nextraordinary results under cultivation. It was, therefore, a hard\nstruggle for existence which Millet in his first years saw going\non around him. Not that the family were any the less happy for having\nto work laboriously for their livelihood. They had been brought up\namidst such surroundings; their wants were simple and easily\ngratified, and the tranquillity of the m\u00e9nage more than\ncounterbalanced those doubtful luxuries which easier circumstances\nwould have brought their way. Throughout his life Millet maintained\nthe extreme simplicity he had seen practised in the home of his\nchildhood, and long years afterwards he was accustomed to look back\nwith pleasureable memories upon his early years.\n\nGruchy, situated in one of the wildest parts of Normandy, feels the\nfull effect of every storm which blows up from the Atlantic. There is\nnothing to shelter the exposed hamlets studded along the coast from\nthe fury of the western gale, and the rocks are but too often strewn\nwith the wrecks of vessels which have come to grief in that terrible\nsea. Millet in his youth must have witnessed many of these\ncatastrophes. Quite a number of drawings by him are extant\nrepresenting succour being extended to some vessel in difficulties, or\nthe hauling up of some wreckage on to the rocks. The studious boy\nmust have been impressed as he saw the sternness of the combat in his\nnative country between men and nature; the wind-swept fields, and\nhills bare to the point of savageness. The very trees themselves\ndwarfed and gnarled; in their struggle with the elements they have\nbeen made tough and hardy as the inhabitants of the country\nthemselves, and, stunted as they are, yet show well that they can\nresist the force of the fiercest storm. The brooding and contemplative\ncharacter of the father having descended to the son, we can quite\nimagine the effect such surroundings would have upon him. As he looked\nback in after years upon his roamings in his native country, he\nappreciated the awe-inspiring character of the scenery in which he had\nbeen born. He would doubtless recall many a walk amidst the fields\nwith the wind blowing in his face as it rushed in from the Atlantic,\nthe rain beating hard upon the freshly ploughed fields, and the\ndistant figure of the ploughman struggling hard with his team against\nthe stiff sou'wester. The great mass of vapour overhead whirled before\nthe violence of the storm, casting grey and pearly light over the\nwhole scene, whilst far away on the top of the hill a clump of trees,\nbent with their resistance to the wind, are silhouetted against the\nsky. Many a drawing of this kind we encounter in the later work of\nMillet, which shows how his thoughts harked back in certain moments to\nthe scenes he had left behind him for ever.\n\nWe know that on one or two occasions he returned to Gruchy. Once or\ntwice he had urgent business which took him back, but sometimes he\nwent with no other purpose than to renew acquaintance with the scenes\nof yore.\n\nLittle Jean Fran\u00e7ois was his grandmother's favourite. It was she who\ntaught him the names of things which surrounded him, and perhaps\ndirected his thoughts in the channels to which they were finally to be\ndevoted. Her brother Charles, who formed one of the family, used to\ntake him for walks, telling him stories on the way. Millet was\ndevotedly attached to this old man, and when at the age of seven years\nhe lost him, the gap in his life thus left made an impression upon his\nmemory never to be effaced.\n\nFive years afterwards he was placed in the hands of the vicar for the\npurpose of preparing him for his first communion. The good man seems\nto have been taken with the child; he found him so attentive to all\nnatural phenomenon which was passing around him and intelligent in an\nunusual degree. He quickly learnt a considerable amount of Latin,\nwhich introduced him to the great classics. Unfortunately for Millet,\nthe vicar accepted an offer of transference to a better parish in the\nvicinity. The boy had made such progress with his master that it was\ndecided that he should go with him to his new abode. He was, however,\nso missed in his own home, that when he came back for his first\nholidays it was decided that he should not return.\n\nHe now gave serious attention to the agricultural pursuits of his\nfather. He threw himself heartily into the work of the farm, and\nassisted in the work of sowing and harvesting, of pruning and\nthrashing according to the season. His spare time was occupied in\nreading with avidity various masterpieces of literature. The authors\nhe found at hand were such as F\u00e9n\u00e9lon and Bossuet, but he developed a\ndecided preference, which lasted till the end of his life, for Virgil\nand the Bible.\n\nIt was at this time that his taste for art began to be developed.\n\nHe drew the objects he found around him, and soon acquired sufficient\nconfidence in his skill to execute a large drawing representing two\nshepherds keeping guard over their sheep. These first efforts date\nfrom about his seventeenth year, and foretell the advent of the style\nin which he was later to become pre-eminent.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE MIGRATION TO PARIS\n\n\nHow frequently has it happened that the first years in the life of a\ngenius have been employed in labour quite different from that to which\nthey should have been directed. Such a state of affairs the more often\noccurs when the sense of duty has been strong enough to overcome\ntemporarily the inclination to pursue the natural bent. In the case of\nMillet, however, the early years which he devoted to the farm and its\npursuits were by no means wasted. It is on record that he became very\nproficient in the various duties in which he was engaged, but at the\nsame time we can be quite sure that his extraordinary faculties of\nobservation were constantly being brought into play, and the fruits of\nhis observations are to be seen in the pictures of his mature period.\n\nA considerable portion of his spare time was taken up with drawing,\nnot only the persons and objects he found around him, but also\nsubjects suggested to him by the books he was in the habit of reading.\n\nHis family, so far from throwing any obstacles in his way, encouraged\nhim. In fact it was his father who took him first to Cherbourg in\norder to show a painter of that town, named Mouchel, the early\nproducts of his son's genius. The decision at which Millet p\u00e8re had\narrived was prompted by a drawing in charcoal of an old peasant\nwalking along the road, which had struck him forcibly as being a work\nof extraordinary merit. It says much for Mouchel's breadth of mind\nthat he was equally impressed with the drawings. A man who had been\nbrought up in the school of David, and who had lived in one of the\nmost reactionary periods of French art, was hardly to be expected to\ntake kindly to a style so diametrically opposed to all the traditions\ninto which he himself had been inculcated; certainly the young\nMillet, who had now arrived at the age of eighteen, had not developed\nthe extraordinary freedom which his works of ten years later\ndemonstrate. But there was sufficient originality even in his early\ndrawings to call forth condemnation from a man who had been so\nsaturated with the teaching of David.\n\nHe prevailed upon Millet to leave his son with him, and set him to\nwork to copy many well-known works of art which he brought before his\npupil by means of engravings. Two months were spent in this way when\nnews reached Millet that his father had been seized with sudden\nillness, and he was obliged in the circumstances to return to\nGr\u00e9ville. He arrived to find the old man unconscious, and very shortly\nafterwards he died.\n\nThis misfortune awoke in Millet a sense of duty which compelled him to\ndesert his studies in Cherbourg and superintend the management of the\nfarm. For some time he devoted himself entirely to his new duties, but\nthe struggle betwixt duty and genius continued; he gave himself to his\nwork with all the energy at his disposal, but his thoughts were ever\nwandering to his art.\n\nAdded to his own inclinations, his grandmother, who perceived his\nextraordinary gifts, strongly persuaded him to devote his attention\nentirely to art, and consequently after some little time he decided to\nreturn to Cherbourg. Here he entered the studio of M. Langlois, an\nartist whose reputation in the town was considerable. Again in this\nworthy man he came in contact with a painter who had been brought up\nentirely under classical influence. Langlois, who had in his early\ndays been a pupil of Gros, had absorbed the classical tradition to\nsuch an extent as to be incapable of appreciating any other style. He\nappears to have endeavoured to mould Millet in his own method rather\nthan develop the latent genius which the latter possessed. The\nincompatibility of these two men speedily caused the younger to strike\nout in his own way. He saw more good in frequenting the museums and\nmaking copies of such works as appealed to him than in listening to\nthe advice of his teacher. All this occurred, however, without any\nbreach of friendship occurring. On the contrary, Langlois, after\nperceiving the futility of inducing his pupil to follow in his\nfootsteps, did all he could to advance his interests.\n\nBy means of his influence some of Millet's drawings were brought\nbefore the Municipal Council, and Langlois suggested that Millet\nshould be sent to Paris in order to further his development, and that\nthe Council should set aside a modest pension to meet his requirements\nin that city. The discussion appears to have been very prolonged, and\nupon the question being put to a vote it was only carried by means of\nthe casting vote of the mayor. Four hundred francs was at first\nallotted to him in this way, which was further increased shortly\nafterwards to six hundred. Such encouragement, meagre though it was,\nwas sufficient to give him a foothold in the metropolis. He left\nCherbourg in January 1837, on a cold and raw day, the snow falling\nheavily throughout the entire journey, and arrived in Paris in a very\ndisheartened condition. The miserable weather, coupled with the long\njourney in which he had had time to think of the small sum which lay\nbetween him and starvation, going to a city which he had never seen\nbefore, had all served to work upon his nerves, and he entered the\ngreat city sick at heart and very despondent.\n\nOne of the first visits he made after he was somewhat settled down in\nParis was to the Louvre. Here he was brought into contact for the\nfirst time with many masters, who were to mould his yet plastic\ntemperament into the form which enabled him to give to the world, in\nlater years, so many masterpieces. As I have said before, it was\nMantegna who first captivated him, and the influence of the mighty\nPaduan was never finally to be shaken off. Michel Angelo awed him with\nhis sublimity; his classical severity tempered with intense humanism,\nhis masculine strength, were bound to have their effect upon so\nserious a character as Millet. Strange as it may seem to those who are\nbut superficially acquainted with his art, and are only too apt to\njudge him by the influence he has had upon modern French painting, he\nwas fascinated with the antique. The traditions of Phidias and\nPraxiteles, in the form in which they had been transmitted through the\ngreatest minds of the Renaissance, were ever the factors which guided\nhim throughout his career. It was this same spirit which impelled his\nfervid admiration for Nicolas Poussin, a master who to-day is sadly\nunderrated and but little understood. It was the mysteries of line,\nthe wonders of pose and composition rather than the magic of colour\nwhich appealed to him. He had a profound admiration for the glowing\ncanvases of Titian and Rubens, but he could never overlook entirely\ntheir defects of drawing or, in the case of Rubens, the tendency to\nvulgarity. From his remarks in after years it would appear that he was\nbaffled with the mysticisms of Velazquez and Rembrandt; pure painting\nitself could never hold him. He needed to grasp the message which lay\nbehind it before he felt fully taken into the confidence of the\npainter; and as the minds of the Dutchman and the Spaniard ran in\nquite different channels to his own, they spoke with a language he\nnever understood. That he had a perceptive and critically independent\nmind may be gauged from his enthusiasm for Delacroix, whose work he\nencountered for the first time at the Luxembourg.\n\nDuring this period of study he was carefully considering under what\nmaster he should place himself. His choice unhappily fell upon\nDelaroche. To any one acquainted with the work of the latter master,\na more unsuitable selection could not have been made. Delaroche and\nthe painters who surrounded him can be appropriately described as\nconstituting the back-wash of the Empire style, which had reached its\nclimax with David. His subjects were always treated with academic\nreserve. No pyrotechnics were permitted; on the contrary, an\neverlasting and mistaken striving for finish was encouraged:\noriginality was sternly suppressed. To paint human life as it really\nwas, was too vulgar for any of the painters of this time. They held\nthe public taste enslaved for years. An innovator such as Millet was\ndestined to become found his position almost untenable. The band of\ncritics and painters formed a monopoly which it seemed almost\nimpossible to break down, and it was only after years of bitter and\ndetermined struggle that the school of nature finally routed its\nopponent.\n\nDelaroche doubtlessly found the peasant painter a little rude both in\nhis person and in his ideas about art. He paid but little attention to\nthe young man who had placed himself in his hands, and devoted all his\ntime to students who were more amenable to his influence. A\ntemperament so sensitive as Millet's was bound to notice this\nneglect, and consequently after a time he became so discouraged that\nhe ceased to frequent Delaroche's studio. Another very good reason for\nthis action was the lack of resources to continue his payments. Even\nduring the time he had been with Delaroche he lost no opportunity of\nturning a few honest francs by painting the portraits of any who could\nbe got to sit to him. Delaroche, however, had a more kindly heart than\nMillet imagined. He seems to have found out the real distress of the\nyoung artist, and to have assisted him pecuniarily in many ways, and\nthere is no doubt that he appreciated the talent of the young Norman\nmuch more than he cared to own. Many of his remarks on record would\nserve to show that Delaroche already felt that his pupil was destined\nto be one of the leaders of the movement which was finally to\noverthrow his own style, and doubtlessly felt a great admiration for a\nman who had the courage and strength to swim against rather than with\nthe current.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STRUGGLE FOR RECOGNITION\n\n\nFreed from all encumbrances save poverty, Millet was now to work out\nhis own destiny according to the dictates of his genius. He joined a\nfriend named Marolle, and the two together occupying a very small\napartment endeavoured to eke out an existence. It was only too soon\napparent that young as he was, and the taste of the public being not\nyet ready for development upon the lines his genius directed him, that\nhis livelihood could not be secured by endeavouring to sell such\nsubjects as appealed to him. In these straits he turned to\nportrait-painting, just as many great painters before and since him\nhave done. That the struggle was very keen can well be imagined by the\nfact that he was unable to obtain more than five to ten francs apiece;\nand, as commissions were very scarce, he was hard put to gain the\nmeans of subsistence. This state of affairs lasted until 1840, in\nwhich year he endeavoured to obtain admission to the Salon with two\nportraits, one of which was that of his friend. This, however, was\nrejected, and the other picture, although accepted, was unnoticed by\neither the critics or the public.\n\nHaving occasion the next year to pay a visit to Cherbourg, he felt\nobliged to report himself to the Municipal Council who had had the\ngenerosity to send him in the first place to Paris. Its worthy members\nexpressed themselves as but little satisfied with the result of their\ninvestment; they claimed that they had had as yet but little to show\nfor their money, and they suggested, partly as a means of\ndemonstrating that they had had some little return, and also, in order\nto see of what stuff their prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was made, that he should paint a\nportrait of the recently deceased mayor. As Millet had not been\npersonally acquainted with that worthy citizen, and as the only guide\nwhich could be supplied him was a portrait made in miniature when he\nwas a young man of some twenty-three or twenty-four years of age, the\ntask was by no means easy. However, the artist set to work with a\nwill, and finally accomplished the picture to his own satisfaction.\n\nUpon it being shown to the Council, one and all declared, as any one\nwith the slightest knowledge of such matters could have told them\nbefore it was commenced, that it bore not the least resemblance to the\ndefunct magistrate. They therefore demurred at the three hundred\nfrancs they had agreed to pay him for the portrait, and offered him\none-third of that amount instead. Millet was deeply offended by the\ninsult, and informed the Council that he made them a present of the\npicture.\n\nIt was during this short visit to his native country that he met his\nfirst wife, a Mlle. Ono, whose portrait he had painted. From the first\nshe was very delicate, and he lost her after much suffering, three\nyears later. His second wife was Mlle. Catherine Lemaire, who was\ndestined to be the companion of his struggles until the end of his\nlife.\n\nMeanwhile Millet was occupied with subjects which he thought would\nappeal to the general public. A number of classical pictures date from\nthis epoch. It was an endeavour on his part to fall in as far as\npossible with the current taste, and so supply means of subsistence\nfor his family. At the same time he did not neglect his favourite\nsubjects, and many are the wonderful studies of peasant life which\ndate from these years. His reputation had so far advanced that he was\noffered the position of teacher of drawing in the college at\nCherbourg. It must have been only after prolonged deliberation that he\nrefused the proffered post. Here a certain annual stipend was assured\nhim, and if it was not large in itself it would at any rate suffice to\nkeep the wolf from the door. He preferred, however, to return to Paris\nand work out his own destiny as best he might.\n\nMillet, who lived at this time in the Rue Rochechouart, began to\nsurround himself with that little group of friends who remained\nfaithful to him until the end of his career. Amongst the earliest were\nCharles Jacque and Diaz: the latter had several clients amongst the\nsmall dealers, whom he induced to visit Millet's studio and make now\nand again a small purchase.\n\nMillet now became a fairly regular contributor to the Salon, but\ngenerally sent some classical or religious picture as well as one of\nhis peasant subjects. For example, in 1848 he sent the marvellous\nstudy of \"The Winnower,\" which we all know so well, accompanied by a\ncanvas, \"The Captivity of the Jews at Babylon.\" The latter, however,\nwas so badly received that he utilised the canvas upon its return for\na large picture of a \"Shepherdess tending her Sheep.\"\n\nIn spite of the headway that he was making, the struggle for existence\nseemed keener than ever, and but for the kindness of friends he and\nhis family would frequently have actually wanted for food. A timely\nadvance of one hundred francs obtained for him from the Minister of\nFine Arts, together with a commission from the State, for which he was\npaid the sum of eighteen hundred francs, were for some time the only\nrelief he obtained from his embarrassments. That he was not particular\nas to how he earned his daily bread is apparent from the fact that he\ndid not despise an order for a shop sign for a midwife, for which he\nwas paid the miserable amount of thirty francs.\n\nThe year 1848 was not an encouraging one for a painter who was\nstanding on the threshold of his career. The whole of Europe was\nseething with revolution. A repetition of the fearful year of 1792 was\neverywhere expected. The struggle betwixt reaction and property on the\none hand, and lawlessness and revolution on the other, was being waged\nwith grim determination. The issue was for long in the balance. One\nnever knew from one day to another what was going to happen. In such a\ndeplorable state of affairs men's minds were running on politics and\nwars rather than upon art. Millet amongst the rest was called upon to\nshoulder the musket, and it can be easily imagined with what\nreluctance he did so.\n\nParis, the great centre of art, had yet not afforded him much\nencouragement. Life was dear in the big city, and surrounded on all\nsides by bricks and mortar he was not free to go out into the fields\nand study the objects which were uppermost in his mind. He resolved to\nescape from it, and once having put the plan into execution he never\nreturned.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET IN HIS MATURITY\n\n\nThe Barbizon of 1850 was a very different place from the Barbizon of\nto-day. The world fame of the men who passed a quiet and strenuous\nexistence in the little village has transformed it into a tourist\nresort, with restaurants and caf\u00e9s, the stopping-places for\nwaggonettes which in summer bring their daily load of sightseers,\neager to see the homes of the painters whose names are now household\nwords.\n\nIt would have been well-nigh impossible for the little band to have\nchosen a more suitable spot for their labours. Rousseau and Millet,\nmuch as they were drawn towards each other by the tie of a sympathetic\ndisposition and by their common interest in art, yet were widely\ndissimilar from one another in their outlook upon art and their\nmethods of worship at the common shrine. Rousseau--one can see it from\nevery picture he painted--loved with all the yearning of a passionate\nand restless temperament the inanimate in Nature. Observe with what\nfidelity he draws his trees, with what caressing tenderness his clouds\nand skies are treated; solitude appealed to him above all things, and\nif here and there he was obliged to insert a few figures to complete\nhis composition, one instinctively feels that he would rather have\nsubstituted a group of cattle or a flock of sheep. In the glades of\nthe forest, far from the busy haunts of men, with the glorious\nsunlight penetrating from above, the breeze moaning through the\nbranches, he was happy. A wild and turbulent temperament such as his\nnot infrequently discovers exquisite enjoyment amidst such perfect\ntranquillity.\n\nBarbizon, situated on the fringe of the great forest of Fontainebleau,\ntherefore, permitted Rousseau to come into daily contact with the\nscenes which so appealed to him.\n\nMillet, on the other hand, was absorbed in the peasant. The man who\ntilled the soil and raised the produce humanity requires for its\nsubsistence by the sweat of his brow; the manifold duties of the\nlabourer, his life and sorrows, appealed to him with irresistible\nforce. An unpeopled track of wild and uncultivated land would not call\nforth any emotion in him, no matter how sublime the scenery might be.\n\nThe life of the village, spreading itself into the vast and fertile\nplain behind, held him absorbed; a peasant himself and living amongst\nthe people he so loved, he was in a position to bring before an\nunthinking world the poignant monotony of their useful lives.\n\nUpon their first arrival at Barbizon, the two artists put up at a\nsmall inn, working all day in a tiny place they had rented from some\npeasants and fitted up as a studio. The inconveniences of this\narrangement were soon apparent, and shortly afterwards Millet took a\nsmall house which was destined to be his abode for the remainder of\nhis life; an old barn in the immediate vicinity meanwhile provided him\nwith an excellent studio.\n\nFrom this period onward we must date the greatest productions of the\nmaster, the works which have induced more thought than those of any\nother peasant painter. A peasant among peasants, his life was of the\nmost rigid simplicity. Behind his little abode a large garden\nstretched away almost to the fringe of the forest itself, and here he\nwas accustomed to work every morning, growing a portion of the food\nnecessary to the sustenance of his family. The afternoon he devoted to\npainting, whilst the evening was given over to intercourse with his\nlittle circle of friends. The simplicity and tranquillity of his life\naroused the whole of his powers to action, and surrounded with\neverything he valued in life he was supremely happy.\n\nThe country around Barbizon appealed to him irresistibly. The\ntimber-studded plains, the gently undulating, highly cultivated\nfields, presented a strange contrast to the wild and rugged country\namidst which he had spent his childhood, and no doubt conduced to the\ndevelopment of a more refined and contemplative style than he would\notherwise have acquired. Upon his few visits to his native country he\nappears to have been more impressed than ever with its austerity, and\nthe drawings which these journeys called forth bore ample evidence of\nthis feeling in him.\n\nLack of the necessary funds to carry on even his simple m\u00e9nage was\never the bane of Millet's life. On many occasions Sensier, his\nintimate friend and afterwards his biographer, informs us he dissuaded\nhim from suicide.\n\nThe sums that he owed, small though they were, rendered him in\nconstant fear of the brokers. With creditors so importunate in their\ndemands for satisfaction, and with the constant lack of recognition,\nwhich was his lot, it is astonishing that Millet achieved so much. He\nwas relieved more than once by the kind-hearted and ever faithful\nRousseau, who when his friend was sorest pressed found some delicately\nhidden means to relieve him. It was he who acquired for 4000 francs\nthe wonderful \"Peasant grafting a Tree,\" when the picture failed to\nfind a purchaser; and in order that Millet should not be aware of his\ngenerosity, he made the offer in the name of an imaginary American.\n\nThis sort of goodness he repeated more than once, and it redounds\nstill more to his credit when we remember that Rousseau himself was\nnot infrequently in pecuniary difficulties.\n\nA constant succession of important works made their appearance during\nthe first ten years Millet spent at Barbizon. The first was the\nwell-known \"Sower,\" which has ever been one of the most popular of his\npictures. Then came the far finer \"Peasants going to Work,\" which for\nmany years was in an English Collection. The \"Gleaners,\" perhaps the\nnoblest canvas the master ever painted, dates from 1857, in which year\nit was seen at the Salon; the celebrated \"Angelus\" followed it two\nyears later. The prices which Millet obtained for this series of\nremarkable works was fantastically small. The \"Gleaners\" brought him a\npaltry 2000 francs, whilst he accounted himself lucky to encounter an\namateur who gave him the same sum for the small \"Woman feeding Fowls.\"\n\nThe \"Angelus,\" which was never exhibited, was sold in the year it was\npainted to a Monsieur Feydeau, an architect, for 1800 francs. It then\npassed through several hands before the late Monsieur Secr\u00e9tan\ncompeted up to 160,000 francs before he became possessed of the prize\nat the John Wilson sale.\n\nThe purchase, however, proved a sound investment, for upon the\ndispersal of his collection it was knocked down for 553,000 francs to\na Monsieur Proust, acting on behalf of the French Government. The\nlatter, however, when they gave the commission to buy the picture, had\nno idea that such a high value would be placed upon it, and\nconsequently refused to ratify the sale; a syndicate now came upon the\nscene, who took it to America. The price, however, proved greater than\neven the millionaires of the States were prepared to give, and the\ncanvas again returned to France, where it found a resting-place in the\ncollection of Monsieur Chauchard, who paid the enormous sum of 800,000\nfrancs for its possession.\n\nIn 1859 Millet sent two works to the Salon, a \"Woman grazing her Cow,\"\nand \"Death and the Woodman.\" The latter, one of the most\nphilosophical of Millet's pictures, which to-day is the principal\nattraction of the Jacobsen Museum at Copenhagen, was rejected.\n\nDisappointments of this kind came with such systematic regularity to\nthe painter that he must have become proof against them. He always had\nbitter enemies amongst the critics, who never failed to pour abuse\nupon his method and his subjects. Even a number of his fellow artists\njoined in the chorus of disapproval. But the vehemence with which he\nwas attacked was striking evidence of the impression he was making and\nthe inward sense of his own powers; and the fact that he was working\nout his destiny according to the dictates of his own genius supported\nhim against this outpouring of prejudice and malice. The social side\nof life appealed to him more strongly as the years rolled on, and the\nmurmurings which had been heard in 1859 as to the socialistic\ntendencies of \"Death and the Woodman\" swelled to a roar when the\nstupendous \"Man with the Hoe\" was exhibited fourteen years later. The\nlatter, one of the most virile studies of depraved humanity which the\nworld has ever seen, has always been a favourite with social\nreformers, and has inspired one remarkable poem. Even his most\nimplacable critics were disarmed before this canvas; its power was\nmagnetic; it was an inspiration, soul moving and trenchant.\n\nHis financial difficulties never completely dispersed. At one time, in\norder to insure himself a little tranquillity, he made a contract with\ntwo speculators, whereby they were to become possessors of all the\nwork he produced for three years, in consideration of their assuring\nhim a thousand francs a month. A great number of Millet's finest\nproductions passed thus through their hands, including the \"Return\nfrom the Fields\" and the \"Man with the Hoe.\" The partners were not\nlong in quarrelling, and after a lawsuit had been fought, Millet was\nleft in the hands of a man who frequently would not or could not pay\nhim in ready money, and whose bills he was frequently forced to\ndiscount at considerable loss.\n\nOne little gleam of sunshine rendered his later days happy. This was a\ncommission from a Colmar banker, Monsieur Thomas by name, who required\nfour allegorical compositions representing the Seasons, to decorate\nhis rooms. The artist was overjoyed by this piece of good fortune,\nand immediately commenced a most conscientious study of such mural\ndecoration as was within reach, in order that he might do full justice\nto his patron. He paid frequent visits to Fontainebleau and the\nLouvre, and even desired a friend to inquire if he could not obtain\nreproductions of the frescoes at Herculaneum and Pompeii. In spite of\nall this elaborate preparation, the subjects were not such as appealed\nto his genius, and in spite of them being well and soundly painted, we\nare told that they presented no features which called for special\ncomment.\n\nHe found, however, a much more genial occupation in accomplishing a\nseries of drawings ordered by a Monsieur Gavet, who paid the artist\n1000, 700, and 450 francs each, according to their size. He made\naltogether ninety-five drawings in this way, and it is said that this\ngentleman had in his possession the finest work in black and white and\nwater-colour the artist ever executed.\n\nTowards the latter end of his life the death of dear relatives and\nfriends cast a sorrowful gloom over him. Amongst the latter Rousseau,\nwho expired in his presence on the 22nd of December 1867, was\nperhaps the loss which seemed to him hardest to bear. A staunch and\ntrusty friend, who was to be relied upon when his prospects seemed the\nmost hopeless, he had been one of the very few who had appreciated\nMillet's talents at their full worth, and who, moreover, scanty as his\nown means were, was ever ready to stretch out his hand to assist his\nstruggling friend.\n\nShortly afterwards Millet paid a visit to his patron, Herr Hartmann,\nat M\u00fcnster, and from here he went for a short time into Switzerland.\n\nUpon his return he devoted himself with great earnestness to work, and\nachieved a certain success at the Salons with his exhibits. The\noutbreak of the war with Germany caused him to migrate with his family\nto Cherbourg, where he thought he might continue to work, removed as\nfar as possible from the scenes of carnage and struggle which were\ngoing on farther east. Transported once more amongst the scenes of his\nchildhood, he felt an increased impetus to production, and when he\nreturned to Barbizon late in 1871, he brought with him a number of\ncanvases of the highest quality; conspicuous amongst them was the\nwonderful \"Gr\u00e9ville Church,\" now in the Louvre.\n\nThe anxieties of his troublous life were, however, beginning to show\ntheir effect upon his constitution; a persistent cough developed, and\nalthough an amelioration would occasionally occur, it was always\nsucceeded by a worse condition than before. His health suffered a\ngeneral decline, and he finally breathed his last on the 20th of\nJanuary 1875. He was buried in the little cemetery of Chailly, beside\nhis friend Rousseau, amidst the scenery they both loved so well.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE MAN AND HIS ART\n\n\nMillet is an instance of an artist working out his own destiny,\nimpelled by irresistible genius, in the teeth of seemingly\ninsurmountable obstacles. He started life with enormous disadvantages;\nwithout friends in influential circles to spread his fame or plead his\ncause; without money to enable him to outlive and triumph over the\nignorant fanaticism of critics and artists, so soaked in the\nconventionalised art of their time that they had not perception enough\nto appreciate the full meaning of that naturalistic movement, which\nwas finally to sweep away the quasi-classic art they boasted of with\nsuch bombastic effusion. The path was hard and thorny, and his triumph\nwas not finally consummated until after his death. He himself found\nhis only satisfaction in the fact that he had lived his life according\nto the dictates of his genius, and had achieved the maximum of which\nhe was capable.\n\nMillet and our own Cotman were somewhat kindred spirits; there is much\nmore affinity between the work of the two men than is apparent to any\none who has not closely studied them. The marvellous \"Breaking the\nClod,\" now happily permanently housed at the British Museum, betrays\nthe same tremendous conception and broad outlook which characterises\nmany a drawing of Millet's. Both highly strung to a painful extent,\nthey were each conscious of their inability to curb the power which\nprescribed a certain course for them, and in spite of pecuniary\ndifficulties and unpopularity, an inevitable result of their intense\noriginality, they pursued a steady course to the end of their lives.\n\nThe socialistic doctrines which have been read into the work of Millet\nare rather the outcome of the world's uneasy conscience being brought\nface to face with a crushing indictment of existing conditions, than\nof any design on the artist's part to further the cause of a political\npropaganda by means of his art. This somewhat extravagant reading into\nhis art has certainly been carried to excess. Particularly has such\nbeen the case in America, where a large number of his finest works are\nat present to be found, curiously enough in the hands of enormously\nwealthy people, who are frequently perhaps the least able to\nunderstand the real meaning of his message.\n\nComing from a peasant stock, his sympathies were always with the\npeasant; it was the only class he understood or cared for. He lived as\none of them, and shared to a large extent in their labour. He has been\ndesignated, not inappropriately, the philosopher in sabots. Rightly or\nwrongly he has come to be looked upon as one of the high priests of\ncommunistic doctrines. Few pictures have been so anathematised as the\n\"Man with the Hoe,\" and perhaps none have done more to inculcate\nsympathy with the degradation of the lower orders of the human race.\n\nThe revolting brutality and vacancy of that face haunts the\nimagination. Is it possible that fellow-creatures so utterly debased\nby toil and neglect exist? Millet dispels any doubt upon the question\nby bequeathing to humanity this trenchant portrait. By no means\nlimited to Barbizon or France, these poor creatures exist in every\ncountry, and curiously enough are considered an essential element in\neach country's development.\n\nThis poignantly human note is observable in almost every work Millet\nwrought; his passionate sympathy with his fellow-man is the keynote of\nhis art. The wood-cutter in his arduous toil, the shepherd in his\nsolitariness, the labourer turning the soil with unvarying and\nlaborious monotony, the mother caring for her children--all carry the\nsame message for him of that strange and incomprehensible mingling of\njoy and sadness we call life. Like many great minds before and since\nhis time, our artist found the greatest joy in life in a placid and\nnever changing melancholy. But the peasants he chose knew nothing of\nthe sadness he saw in them. Completely inured to their toil, and\nsubdued by it, with no refining or uplifting influence to stimulate\nthem, they knew nothing, aspired to nothing beyond what they were; it\nwas left to Millet to supply the \"might have been.\" He saw the inky\nblackness of the mind of the \"Man with the Hoe,\" the pathetic\ninequality between the mounted farmer directing the safe storage of\nhis crop, and the stooping figures of the \"Gleaners\" eager to scrape\nup the miserable crumbs which had fallen from the rich man's table. He\ntraced the lives of these simple folk until we arrive at the grim and\ngaunt figure of Death, who, as he grasps the woodman by the shoulder,\nreminds him that his course is finished and that he, in common with\nall his fellow-men, must enter the great unknown land from which there\nis no return. It is a sad and melancholy art, vibrating with purity\nand truth, the outpouring of a great soul yearning to express itself\nto the utmost of its power. The mind and character of the man can be\nread in every line and in every touch of the brush. His drawings and\netchings are even more searching in their virility than his pictures.\n\nThere is a spontaneousness about them we search for in vain in his\nwork in oil and pastel. In black and white his intensely emotional\nmind found a swift method of expression; in the laboriousness of oil\npainting he was fettered with the complications of the medium. It can\nbe fairly said that only in one or two paintings--a notable example\ncan be cited in the wondrous \"Sawyers\" at South Kensington--does he\nrise to the height of a great painter. Millet was a poet, a\nphilosopher, a great thinker, and the means he chose for expressing\nhimself were those which were best fitted to his purpose. His\npredilections in art were concentrated upon the greatest, and\nconsequently the men who appealed to him were the thinkers of the\nages. Mantegna and Correggio, Michel Angelo and the mighty Greeks,\nthese were the masters who left their impress upon his mind and art.\n\nThe influence of so sincere and profound an artist has necessarily\nbeen profound. He has moulded men who have achieved world-wide fame;\nSegantini, for example, would never have risen to the heights he did\nhad the example of Millet not been ever before him. There have been\nmany who, without possessing his genius, have endeavoured to follow\nin his footsteps, but successfully as his imitators have sometimes\ncaught his style, their productions can never live alongside his,\nbecause they lack the real ring of sincerity.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n        a. One bed, or folding cot,\n        b. One oil stove,\n        c. One lamp,\n        d. Enough supplies of all kinds sufficient for six months,\n        e. Pots, pans, kettles, etc.\nIt is needless to say that positions in Manila and Iloilo were now at\na premium.\n\nWas it possible that teachers were to be sent to places where even the\nnecessaries of life could not be obtained! Was it possible that many\nwould be sent to places so remote that for six months no fresh\nsupplies could be gotten! A mass meeting was held at once, and a\ncommittee was appointed to send a cablegram to the Associated Press\npetitioning aid from the American people at large. Realizing what\nconsternation would be created throughout the United States by such a\nmessage, two of the teachers leaped into a carriage at the close of\nthe meeting and a few moments later were closeted with the chief\nexecutive of the department. As a result the committee was persuaded\nnot to send the cablegram to the Associated Press until by courtesy it\nhad been sent to the President. Of course, this diplomatic move tided\naffairs over and the teachers who had flatly refused to budge from\nManila now agreed to go on to their stations, being assured that\nwhatever action was best would be taken.\n\nThe day had come when we must separate. We were to enter an untried\nand an unknown field. It was fitting that we have a final joyous\nmeeting, so the best orchestra in the archipelago was engaged and we\n\"chased the hours with flying feet\" until dawn so that whatever might\ncome to us in that unknown future upon which we were entering each\nwould hold in pleasant memory our last evening together.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER III. - A DRAMA IN ACTUAL LIFE.\n\n\nAlmost every one heeded the warning to go to his station forearmed\nwith at least necessaries of life, but, as it had never fallen to the\nlot of the writer to cook, he refused to learn at that late day, so he\ntook no pot, no pan, no kettle, putting his future into the hands of\nan uncertain fate and relying upon the unknown hospitality of the\nFilipino.\n\nBacalod, the capital of the province of Occidental Negros, was our\ndestination. The second morning after leaving Manila, we awoke with\nthe \"Kilpatrick\" lying at anchor in a shallow bay. We were several\nmiles from the shore and nothing in sight indicated that we had\nreached a place of any importance. Late the night before we had been\nawakened by the loud, sharp ringing of the ship's bells, accompanied\nby the reversal of the engines and a general disturbance awaking the\ncrew. So our first impressions on coming on deck were that we had run\naground. But the captain assured us that everything was ship-shape and\nthat this was the nearest point of approach to Capiz, a town of\nconsiderable importance on the island of Panay, where a body of troops\nwas to embark for home. Not even the grass hut of a native was in\nsight. Search as we would, not a sign was seen of a stream flowing\ninto the sea, indicating the probable presence of a town. There was\nnot a sign of life of any kind save one lone column of thin, blue\nsmoke that arose from the side of a mountain miles away. One would\nhave thought that we were explorers of three hundred years ago lying\noff the shore of some unknown land.\n\nAfter breakfast the steam launch, together with all the boats, was\nlowered, and several of us who had determined to miss no opportunity\nto gather information about the islands took our places in the launch\nby the side of the ship's mate, and steamed away across the water with\na long line of boats strung out in the rear. We headed away toward a\ngroup of cocoanut trees, and about an hour later stepped ashore on a\npile of decayed coral rocks that extended some twenty or thirty feet\nout into the water, thus forming the only landing place of a town of\nseveral thousands of people and of considerable commercial importance.\n\nA few moments after we had landed, an army wagon drawn by a\nmagnificent pair of mules came up out of a tropical jungle along a\nnarrow road. We clambered into the wagon and were soon lost in the\ndepths of foliage from which we had just seen the vehicle emerge.\n\nLong waving bamboos with their plumy leafage hung over the road from\neach side, meeting and overlapping in the center until they formed an\narchway so dense that the tropical sun now high in the heavens\npenetrated it only at intervals. At times the wagon sank up to the\nhubs in the soft earth, and the muscles of the mules stood out like\nwhip-cords under the skin as they drew us forward.\n\nAt a sharp turn in the road we came upon the first division of troops\nthat was to embark for home. The look of joy upon their sun-browned\nfaces was inexpressible. Their work was done, and with elastic step\nand smiling faces they saluted us as they passed by. The reign of\nforce was at an end; it was going out with them; the reign of peace\nhad begun; it was coming in with us.\n\nIn the afternoon when we returned from the town the last of the troops\nhad arrived and, as we drove up, the bugle was sounding the call to\nsupper. We noticed native women mingling with the troops and, indeed,\na native woman was in constant attention waiting upon one of the\nsoldiers with whom we ate. Her clothes were clean, her hair was nicely\ncombed, and her general appearance was neat. She seemed to anticipate\nthe slightest wish of the soldier with whom she was. She brought him\nwater to drink, cleaned his plate after the meal and saw that his\nknife, fork, and spoon were put into his haversack.\n\nWe had now finished supper and the launch had returned for the last\nload of troops. The lieutenant in command of the company gave the\norder to \"fall in\"; the men shouldered their rifles and fell into\nline. \"Forward, march!\" called the lieutenant, and the column swept\nforward towards the boats. The women had until now restrained\nthemselves, but, as their husbands marched away never to return, their\nfeelings could no longer be restrained. One young woman of about\neighteen, who was leaning against a rock by the roadside sobbing, when\nher husband passed, leaped up in frenzy of passionate love and caught\nthe rifle from his shoulder. Her first impulse seemed to be to throw\nthe gun away, but suddenly realizing the futility of such an act she\nburst into tears, shouldered the rifle herself and marched on by his\nside. Another woman of more mature age threw her arms around the legs\nof a tall stalwart man, and drew him bodily from the line.\n\nBut the troops marched on and entered the boats. One woman who had\nbeen unnoticed before came down into the shallow water and caught hold\nof our last boat as if to prevent its leaving, while others stood\nmingling their sobs with the sounds of the wavelets as they broke on\nthe sands. As we passed away, an expectant mother, standing in bold\noutline against the twilight sky, threw up her hands in an agony of\ndespair and then sank upon the stones. The curtain had fallen upon a\ndrama in actual life deeper in pathos than any other we had ever seen\nor ever expected to see. Depth of passion, depth of love! Who can\nfathom the human heart?\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. - WHAT THE TEACHERS DID.\n\n\nThere is a remarkable sameness about the towns in the Philippines.\n\nThey all have a large open square about the middle of the town, around\nthree sides of which are Chinese stores, unless one side lies open to\nthe sea, and on the fourth is the great stone ecclesia. The streets\nrun at right angles to one another and divide up the town into\ncreditable squares.\n\nEverybody in the Philippines lives up-stairs, for the ground is so\nsoaked with water during the rainy season that it is a menace to\nhealth to live upon the ground floor. So even the poorest nippa hut\nis built upon stakes four or five feet above the ground.\n\nBacalod is a typical Philippine town. As we landed, a broad open\nsquare was spread out before us. Two sides of the square were lined\nwith two-story houses in which were Chinese stores below and Filipino\nhomes above. On the third side stood the great stone church in whose\nmassive tower the clock was striking the hour of four, while the\nfourth lay open to the sea that had borne us thither.\n\nWe landed, but it was in a method new to us and one not usually\nemployed by the traveling public.\n\nWhen our sail boat ran aground on the sandy bottom a hundred yards or\nmore from the shore, a crowd of Filipino men who were on the beach\nslowly rolled up their pantaloons and waded out to the rescue,--for\nthe money that was in it. The boat's crew elevated their trousers'\nlegs also and slided down into the water. Each of us then straddled\nthe neck of a Filipino standing in the water and was held by ankles to\nbe steadied while our biped mounts proceeded to the shore.\n\nWe were now on the ground and face to face with the situation. To give\nthe reader an idea of the actual conditions met by the first teachers\nwho went to the Islands, the following is copied from the instructions\ngiven us in Manila:\n    1. There shall be two sessions daily of all schools, and the\n    last hour of the morning session shall be devoted solely to\n    instructing the Filipino teachers.\n\n    2. In cases where teachers are sent to a town in which there\n    is no school-house, they are expected to secure the aid of the\n    people and have one built.\n\n    3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is\n    stopped.\n\n    4. All supplies must be kept under lock and key. In towns\n    where there is no case or box to lock the supplies in, and it\n    is also impossible to get the town council to furnish a case,\n    a requisition may be sent to Manila, and, if an appropriation\n    can be secured, one will be made and sent out.\n\nThus it can be easily seen that we were indeed pioneers. In many\nplaces no school-house was to be found, and in some cases it was even\ndifficult to get the town council to provide a case in which to keep\nthe supplies.\n\nThe work of the teachers was, in short; to \"make the English language\nthe basis of instruction in the public schools.\" On our arrival at\nBacalod two schools were found in progress, for some soldiers had been\ndetailed for the work here previous to our coming. One of these was\nfor boys and the other, for girls. Thus the work here had been in a\nmeasure simplified, but complications that had arisen at Talisay, one\nof the largest and richest towns on the island, demanded a change of\nteachers and the writer was assigned to the place as superintendent.\n\nHere an attempt had been made to start a school but it had failed\nignominiously and a system of education was to be put into operation\nfrom the very start.\n\nThe Filipinos are not strong advocates of co-education, so separate\nschools were to be started for the boys and the girls. The one for the\nboys was gotten well in hand before the one for the girls was\nattempted at all.\n\nA few days after reaching the town and securing a home the\npresidente of the town had it publicly announced that the following\nMonday morning at eight o'clock a public school for boys would be\nopened in a building that had been rented for the purpose by the\nmunicipal council. About the middle of the afternoon of the same day a\nman beat a little drum throughout all the streets of the town to call\nthe people out and the town clerk announced both in Spanish and in the\nnative language that this public school would begin at the time and\nplace mentioned above; that instruction would be free to all who came;\nthat the government would furnish all supplies; and that instruction\nwould be given in the English language. A native principal and\nassistants were employed and everything was ready to begin.\n\nThe official report of the result is as follows:\n    Boys' public school of Talisay, Negros, P. I., began November\n    4, 1901. Forty-three boys present at eight o'clock. Forty-one\n    of them knew \"good morning\" and \"good afternoon\" but do not\n    know the distinction between them. Two of them speak simple\n    Spanish. At eight forty-five, eight more, who had been\n    attending an early morning private school, came in together.\n\n    The books they brought were so varied and so different from\n    one another that it seemed impossible to bring any reasonable\n    degree of order out of such a chaos, and so, after struggling\n    vainly for about a week with the problem, the superintendent\n    by one fell stroke removed everything in use and put in a\n    uniform system, and from that day on the English language has\n    been the basis of instruction in the public schools of\n    Talisay. The work was of necessity very slow at first, but by\n    the end of a year two schools were going nicely and a number\n    of the brightest boys and girls had made really excellent\n    progress.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER V. - A \"BAILE.\"\n\n\nNot long after the arrival of our party at Bacalod we received an\ninvitation to a \"baile\" given in our honor by the inhabitants of\nSilay, a town some ten or twelve miles up the northern coast and one\nnoted for its social life. The invitation was accepted with pleasure,\nand about the middle of the afternoon on the day appointed we were\nclad in the immaculate white of the tropics and steaming away up the\ncoast on board a launch sent for our conveyance. Twilight was still\nlingering on the path of day when we anchored just off shore at the\ntown. A row-boat containing the officials of the city came out to meet\nus and, in due season, we were ushered into a spacious drawing-room\nfilled almost to overflowing with the \u00e9lite of the town. The \u00e9lite of\ntowns in the Philippines speak Spanish, and, as only one or two of our\nparty could at that time boast of more than a formal acquaintance with\nthe Castilian tongue, the exchange of ideas that evening between us\nand the Filipinos was of necessity not very rapid.\n\nThe necessity of easy communication between us was rendered somewhat\nless indispensable by the announcement of supper as soon as we were\nrested from our trip. When we had taken our places at the table a\nyoung Filipino about twenty-five years of age arose and gave a lengthy\ntoast to the recent union of the Philippines with the United States.\n\nBut as we Americans were unable to scale the dizzy heights of his\nclimaxes or sink to the depths of his pathos, we forewent the\npleasures of his oratory and turned our attention to the savory odor\nof lamb, chicken, and roast pig that came slyly stealing up our\nnostrils to send us nerve dispatches about the gastronomic delights of\nour not far distant future.\n\nAt last the toast was ended and the world-wide soup ushered in a long\ntrain of things good to eat, served in a style better fitted to the\ndelights of the appetite than to the formalities of dinners, for, as\nsoon as the pleasant task of one dish was completed by any one, the\nnext was served him at once regardless of the progress made by the\nothers at the table.\n\nThe last course was dulce. The new-comers to the Philippines will\nnot be long in making the acquaintance of this dish, and at all\nmeetings, both public and private, where eatables are served, it\nperforms an important part. It is anything sweet, and it may vary all\nthe way from an india-rubber-like black mixture of cocoanut milk and\ndirty sugar to a really toothsome and respectable confection. No\nmatter of what materials a dish is composed, just so long as it is\nsweet, it is dulce.\n\nAfter paying our respects to this last course, we arose from the table\nand entered a great rectangular room from the center of whose ceiling\nhung a large glass chandelier, a mass of shimmering crystals. In the\nchairs around the room were the wealth, the youth, and the beauty of\nthe town.\n\nThe first and also the last number of every Filipino dance of any\nformality is the \"rigodon.\" The dancers are arranged in a square, or\nquadrangle according to the number participating, and are then led\nthrough a tangled maze of figures that so utterly bewilders the novice\nthat he sinks into his chair at the end of the dance wondering how it\nall came to pass.\n\nWe Americans breathed a sigh of relief when the \"rigodon\" ended, and\nmustered fresh courage for social conquests in the waltz that was now\nbreathing forth from the trembling strings. My companion in the first\ndance had been the young lady by whose side I had sat at dinner. But\nit now became necessary to search for another, so I prudently waited\nto see how partners were chosen, and made no mistake when a few\nmoments later I faced one of the most luscious looking se\u00f1oritas on\nthe opposite side of the room and offered her my arm. My eyes must\nhave told the story that my lips could not utter in Spanish, for she\nsmiled upon me sweetly, arose, and put her hand upon my shoulder. My\narm encircled her waist and I began to waltz. Unfortunately my\ncompanion did not follow, but began to hop up and down in a manner\nmost distressing. Supposing the attack to be only temporary, I paused\nand, much to my relief, she soon showed signs of recovery; and in the\ncourse of time she came to a standstill looking up into my face in an\ninquiring sort of way, apparently wondering why St. Vitus had not paid\nhis respects to me also. A second attempt to follow the music met with\nresults similar to the first, and during the third attempt, which\nseemed to be trembling on the verge of a failure, St. Vitus let go my\ncompanion and seized me with such vigor that she, who was small even\nfor a Filipino, was gathered up bodily and taken around the room at\nsuch a pace that her toes touched the floor only at far distant\nintervals.\n\nAt this point my devotion to the shrine of Terpsichore ceased from\nforce of circumstances and I seated myself in one of the most\ncomfortable chairs in sight that I might carry out a previously formed\nplan to study the Filipino somewhat critically as he appears in\nsociety.\n\nThe first thing that impressed me as the dancers passed up and down\nthe room was the flash of diamonds. Nearly every woman in the room had\non a brooch that flashed the colors of the rainbow at every turn.\n\nAlmost all of them wore one or more rings that showed up brilliantly\nunder the chandelier. Many of the men too, especially the young men,\nwore gems that appeared to be exquisite. A closer inspection showed\nthat some of the gems had flaws and others were of a poor color, but\nno one would have denied that, taken as a whole, it was a really\nbeautiful display.\n\nThe dress of the ladies was richly colored. Many of their skirts were\nof silk covered with hand embroidered flowers, and their filmy pina\nwaists and broad collar pieces were rich with needle-work. They all\nwore a kind of heelless velvet slipper, very common as a dress shoe in\nthe Philippines, or high-heeled patent leather shoes with neatly\nfitting black stockings.\n\nThe men were dressed in white coats and white pantaloons or black\ncoats and white pantaloons. White shirts and collars, together with\nall sorts and styles of cravats and low-cut patent leather shoes with\nhighly colored socks completed their dress.\n\nIt was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money;\nthat they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a\ntable loaded with good things was a fact to which all of us were\nenthusiastic witnesses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VI. - A SKETCH OF LIFE IN THE PHILIPPINES.\n\n\nHouse-keeping in the Philippines presents some interesting phases. Our\nclub of American officials decided to run a mess, so we employed a\ncook and a house boy, then each of us provided himself with a personal\nservant, making a total of six servants for four men--it takes about\nthis proportion of servants to live in any sort of comfort in the\nPhilippines--and launched ourselves boldly upon the sea of domestic\neconomy. But there were shoals ahead of us, for the question of\nregulating servants is one of no small importance in the Philippines,\nand one of its most disadvantageous features is the long chain of\ndependents that usually attends it.\n\nWe gave the cooks so much a day with which to buy supplies in the\nlocal market, for our own table, making him render a daily list of\nexpenditures, and a fixed amount besides to purchase rice and fish for\nhimself and the other servants. Of course, if they wished to vary\ntheir diet and get chicken and fresh pork, which could be had at far\ndistant intervals, it was wholly a matter of their option, but the\nallowance was made on the basis of so much rice and fish a day for\neach. This allowance was about fifteen cents a day in Spanish coin per\nservant.\n\nThus far all was well. We had agreed to give the cook eight dollars a\nmonth in Spanish money, thinking that good wages would procure good\nservice, but the visions of affluence that floated before him on such\nfloods of wealth were so alluring that they drew him from the kitchen\nto the cooler veranda. In less than a week he had employed an\nassistant at four dollars a month; in less than another week that\nassistant had employed him an assistant at two dollars a month; in\nless than another week that assistant to the assistant had employed\nhim an assistant at the princely salary of fifty cents a month; and\nfrom fear that the chain of dependents would end only by our having\nthe whole Filipino race attached to our culinary force, we broke up\nhouse-keeping and went boarding again, choosing that as the less of\nthe two evils.\n\nOur house furnishings were almost wholly Philippine. The table ware\nand the food on the table came from the ends of the earth. The knives\nand forks were made in Germany, the plates were manufactured in\nEngland, the glass ware and table cloth, in the United States. The\noatmeal and flour came from the United States also. The butter came\nfrom Australia, the rice from China, the salt from Russia, and the\nother eatables from sources about as various as their separate names.\n\nSwitzerland furnished the condensed milk and Illinois the canned\ncream. Nearly all of the canned fruit bore labels from Spain.\n\nThus it can easily be seen that life in the Philippines, if lived\naccording to American ideals, is dependent upon a highly developed and\nhighly complex commerce. However, the difficulties of transportation\nand the restriction of large stocks of merchandise to Manila and some\nhalf a dozen other towns, make so great a difference between country\nlife and city life that a short comparison of the two will not be out\nof place, and life in Manila may well be taken as being fairly typical\nof the latter.\n\nLife in Manila is pleasant, but expensive. It is pleasant from the\nfact that it is not only the capital but also metropolis of the\narchipelago. Thus the combination of wealth and high official position\nhas given to Manila a society of the highest and most refined type.\n\nThe process of beautifying and improving the city which is constantly\ngoing on bids fair to give us at no distant day a city of which we may\nwell be proud.\n\nBut let him who intends living well in Manila on a small income bid\nfarewell at once to so idylic a dream, for it costs much to live well\nthere. In the city of Manila one can get almost anything he wishes,\nbut it must be paid for at the price it commands. Especially in the\ncase of eatables, this price is by no means small, because to the\nfirst cost of articles must in most cases be added the expense of\ndistant shipment from American, European, or Australian ports, and not\ninfrequently the cost of long refrigeration must also be taken into\nconsideration. But, expensive though it is, it is very pleasant to\nlive there and those who have once enjoyed it often wish again to\nquaff the cup of its delights.\n\nIn strong contrast to this pleasant life is the life of the quiet\nlittle hamlet away in the distant islands. Indeed, the Filipino from\nthe distant town, who by some good fortune has been to Manila, or, by\na coup de main, has studied in one of the Manila colleges, is looked\nup to in a true hero-worshiping attitude by all who either know him or\nhear of his fame. Life in such a place is one long state of harmless\ninactivity. Not a wave of trouble from the great outer world ever\ndisturbs its peaceful repose. One lounges forever in an air of\nindolent ease and extreme aversion to anything approaching what might\nbe called a respectable effort.\n\nOne arises in the morning about the time the sun's first rays silver\nthe top leaves of the cocoanut trees and then stirs around until nine\nor ten o'clock, when it is found expedient to avoid a further exposure\nto the sun. From then until about five o'clock in the afternoon it is\nbest to take things as they come, even though one of those things be a\nFilipino dinner. But then you may have your vehiclo attached to a\nyoung bull with a ring in his nose and go for a drive. If it is the\ndry season you will probably enjoy the drive unless you object to the\nfrequent clouds of dust swept along by the evening wind. If it is in\nthe rainy season your pleasure will depend to a considerable extent\nupon how wet you get; but, whether the season be wet or dry, your\npleasure will be regulated largely by the state of harmony existing\nbetween the driver and the bull.\n\nIn these quiet secluded nooks successive generations of Filipinos are\nborn, reared, grow old and die in an even chain of events broken only\nby the occasional erection of a new grass house on the identical spot\nwhere its predecessors have stood for ages. The son lives in the house\nof his father, cultivates the same few square feet of soil planted in\nedible roots, climbs the same cocoanut trees, follows the same winding\npath down to the stream, pounds rice in the same mortar and with the\nsame stick that his ancestors have used from time unremembered, and,\nin case of illness, curls up on a grass mat in a corner of the room\nuntil he dies or by some good fortune recovers. Beyond this narrow\nhorizon he never looks. So narrow and contracted is the life that the\nlanguages of two towns a few miles apart are so different that one\nwould scarcely recognize them as belonging to the same race of people.\n\nSuch are the two extremes of life in our new far Eastern provinces:\nthe one is active, progressive, and cosmopolitan; the other, inactive,\ndecadent, and narrow; but, whether one enjoys the first or endures the\nsecond, there comes to him after leaving a longing to lounge again in\ntropic airs and listen to the lullaby of the winds among the palms.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VII. - THE FILIPINO AT HOME.\n\n\nAs one enters a Filipino sitting-room for the first time, there is one\nfeature in the arrangement of the furniture that impresses itself upon\nhim at once, and it may be stated without fear of serious\ncontradiction that this same peculiar feature in its arrangement will\ncontinue to face him, as he enters different homes, about as certainly\nas he crosses the threshold.\n\nThe arrangement referred to is that of one large mirror, one settee,\nand some ten or a dozen chairs that appear to have had a certain\norderly affection for one another. The mirror is hung upon one of the\nlarge interior parts of the house about four feet above the floor. The\nwooden houses in the Philippines are built by setting large posts\nupright into the ground, extending into the air from twenty to thirty\nfeet. Cross timbers are fastened to these upright posts about eight or\nten feet above the ground and then not sawed off even with the posts,\nbut allowed to extend beyond them each way. The framework of the house\nis built upon these extending cross timbers, a style of building by\nwhich these large upright posts are left standing out on the inside of\nthe room from one to three feet from the walls. It is on that one of\nthese posts most nearly opposite the door that the mirror always finds\nits place. Immediately beneath the mirror is the settee; and the\nchairs are arranged in two parallel lines facing one another and at\nright angles with the ends of the settee. However odd this arrangement\nmay appear to one when he first enters a Filipino drawing-room, there\nare two things to be said in its favor. In the first place, it places\nyou face to face with the person with whom you are conversing so that\nyou can watch him,--a matter of no small moment in the Philippines. In\nthe next place, it enables you to give one of the young ladies a\nsheep's-eye in the mirror while the others present are left where\nMoses was in our much abused conundrum.\n\nThe size of the residence and the quality of its furnishings depends\nupon the wealth of the owner. But there is so vast a difference\nbetween the mode of life of the highest class and the tao, or lowest\nclass, that it is well to speak of them separately, and the great\nmiddle class of Filipinos can easily be imagined to occupy the\nintervening ground.\n\nThe rich Filipino's house is usually of wood built upon a wall of\nstone or brick from ten to fifteen feet high. The floors are kept\nhighly polished in his hallway, dressing-room, and bed-rooms. There\nare, of course, no fire-places in any of the rooms, but on some\noccasions something is needed to dry the rain-soaked atmosphere, for\neven in the dry season it has been seen to rain for five successive\ndays and nights without the cessation of a moment.\n\nA long chain of dependents is attached to the household of the rich\nFilipino. The master has his special body servant to be present at all\ntimes to do his master's bidding, in short, to be the visible\nmechanism of his master's volition. So, too, the lady of the house has\nher servant woman to do the slightest bidding of her ladyship. Then\nthere is the cook who is almost invariably a man, a house boy or two,\nand the coachman. These functionaries, with their assistants and\nassistants to the assistants, together with a servant or two for the\nexclusive service of the children, complete the economic household.\n\nSuch a family has an abundance of rice and wheat bread, also of\nchicken and fish with occasional fresh beef. They have also a good\ndeal of dulce. They regularly serve wine and frequently serve beer\non their tables.\n\nIn strong contrast with this mode of life is that of the tao. His\ndiet consists almost wholly of rice and small uncleaned fish boiled\ntogether. As a rule knife, fork, plate, and spoon find no place in his\nhousehold. The rice and fish are boiled in a pot and then allowed to\ncool in the same vessel or poured out to cool in a large earthen or\nwooden bowl. Then Mr. Tao together with Mrs. Tao and all the young\nTaos squat on their heels around the mixture and satisfy that\nintangible thing called the appetite. They do not use chop sticks as\nthe Chinese do, but the rice and fish are caught in a hollow formed by\nthe first three fingers of the right hand. The thumb is then placed\nbehind the mass. It is raised up and poised before the mouth, with a\nskill coming from the evolution of ages, when a contraction of the\nmuscles of the thumb throws the mass into the mouth with a skill that\nis marvelous to any but a Filipino. To judge from the most reliable\ninformation, the poorest class do not have an abundance of food,\nalthough it would seem that such a condition of things would be\nwell-nigh impossible. However, in a census of one hundred school\nchildren there were found six boys and four girls who declared that\nthey had never had enough to eat, and the native teacher stated that\nthis was probably true.\n\nThe wide gulf between the tao and the rich man is filled by the\ngreat middle class of Filipinos.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VIII. - VISIT TO A LEPER COLONY.\n\n\nNot far from our town was a leper colony and the first Saturday that\ncould be spared was set aside for a trip to the place. It happened\nthat none of the other Americans were at leisure on this particular\nmorning, but, rather then delay the trip or miss it altogether, the\nwriter, armed with a revolver, started out alone.\n\nThe road had been described so accurately by one who was supposed to\nknow it that it was deemed well-nigh impossible to miss the way. The\nmain highway was followed to the point where the by-path supposed to\nlead to the settlement turned off through some bamboo thickets and a\nlow tropical wood. This path led straight away towards the sea-coast\nwhere the houses of the colony were said to stand in a cocoanut grove\nby the beach.\n\nUpon arriving at the settlement, a very inhospitable reception was\nreceived from a mangy cur that growled and showed a very uninviting\nset of sharp, white teeth behind his snarling lips. The growling of\nthe dog had attracted the attention of an old man who, with age-bent\nback, was pounding rice in a mortar about fifty yards away. He turned\nslowly around and, upon seeing an intruder into the primitive quiet of\nthe place, gave a sharp, far-reaching call. The sound had scarcely\nrung through the grove when from about a dozen of the little grass\nhouses dotted here and there fifteen or twenty men armed with bolos\ncame out and gathered around the old man. A sense of my danger flashed\nupon me. Three miles from town and alone in a tropical jungle, I could\nbe almost instantly overcome by this band of bolo-men, and the only\nreport that would ever reach my people would be that I had\n\"disappeared.\" Of course, attack was by no means certain, but the\npotentiality of the situation was thrilling. A drawn revolver and the\ngleaming of its shining barrel had the effect of stopping the men, who\nseemed to be hesitating as to a course of action, until a somewhat\ndignified retreat was made to an open space in the rear from where a\nless dignified and a more hasty retreat began which did not stop short\nof Bacalod.\n\nEnough had been seen, however, even in this short visit, to give\nconvincing proof that the settlement visited was no colony of lepers;\nso, that afternoon two servant boys being taken as guides and\ninterpreters, another attempt was made to reach the goal desired.\n\nThis attempt was successful, and, after about two hours of walking, a\nlittle cluster of grass huts snugly hidden by the sea-coast came into\nview. As we approached, one would have thought it a gala-day. Some few\nchildren, apparently from six to thirteen years of age, almost wholly\nnude, were romping and playing in the open space around which the huts\nstood, and no one would ever have thought that any cloud so horrible\nas leprosy could hover over a place apparently so happy.\n\nBy the side of the path as we passed was a man and his wife setting\nout potato plants. His hands were so puffed and his fingers so short\nthat he could scarcely use them, but he was working along as best he\ncould. His wife's feet were so swollen and twisted that she walked\nonly with the greatest difficulty. We passed them by and entered the\nopen space above referred to.\n\nThe children now saw us, and those of them who could darted away like\nfrightened rabbits, each to his own burrow. An old man who was sitting\nin the warm afternoon sun on the little bamboo platform before his hut\nwas aroused from his lethargic repose by the scampering away of the\nchildren. He arose, trembling upon his tottering limbs, all drawn and\ntwisted, and hobbled away into his hut.\n\nThe children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at\nthe doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of\nthe settlement. In a few moments we were surrounded by a circle of\nhuman beings at once so repulsive and so pitiable that its graphic\nvividness can never be accurately portrayed.\n\nThe old man referred to above, having put on a pair of snow-white\npantaloons, appeared now at the doorway of his hut, followed a few\nmoments later by his wife who had evidently clothed herself in the\nbest raiment she had. At a call from the old man, all the men, women,\nand children in the settlement came out of their huts and stood in a\nline before us. The old man was spokesman and in his native visayan\ntongue made a heart-rending appeal for aid which we were powerless to\ngive. Attention was called to a leper woman, apparently about\ntwenty-five years of age, whose face had been attacked by the disease\nand whose appearance was truly pathetic. Upon her hip was a child\nabout a year and a half old and, strange to say, the child showed as\nyet no signs whatever of the disease.\n\nWhat an indissoluble enigma is life! Here in a little cluster of grass\nhuts in a secluded nook of a secluded island of an all but secluded\narchipelago was gathered together a little community of wretched\nnatives, driven by their loathsomeness from association with others\neven of the same half-savage race. Yet here, men and women loved and\nwere married, by mutual trust if not by law, and children were born of\nthe union to live forever under the unspeakable horror that\novershadowed the unfortunate parents. Love, hatred, sorrow, and\njoy--every passion that enters into the complex structure of the human\nheart even here, in this scene of sadness and despair, was playing\napparently as freely as where misfortune and disease had never crossed\nthe portals of life.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER IX. - A \"HIKE.\"\n\n\nWe were lounging lazily in our hammocks at Jimamaylan one evening in\nApril. Supper was just ended, and the soldiers in the post were\ncollected in groups here and there spinning yarns to pass away the\ntime, when a Filipino clad only in a loin cloth came down the street\nat a steadily swinging run and stopped in front of the sentry. He\nbrought the announcement that a band of ladrones had just burned a\nsugar mill and were advancing to sack a barrio about fifteen miles\naway.\n\nThe invitation of the commanding officer to go on a \"hike\" was eagerly\naccepted, and, in ten minutes after the message was given, the troops\nwere on the march followed by two adventurous pedagogues.\n\nDarkness was just closing in as we left the town, but a resplendent\ntropic moon soon made the night almost as brilliant as the day. The\ntrail we followed led over rough and rocky country. Sometimes for a\ndistance of a mile or more we passed over barren wastes of volcanic\nslag poured out in anger by some peak whose convulsions have long\nsince ceased. Again we would descend into a tropical jungle from the\ndense foliage of which the ladrones could have leaped at any moment,\nhad they known of our coming, and annihilated our little band. We\nforded rapid streams with the water at our breasts, and halted only\nonce in that rapid march of fifteen miles.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the town we met a man who was standing\nguard against a surprise by the ladrones. Nothing could well have been\nmuch more grotesque and nothing could much better illustrate the\nabsolutely primitive condition of the Filipinos in the interior of the\nislands than the appearance of this guard. A pair of knee pants, a\nconical grass hat, and a hemp shirt formed his entire apparel. A long\nflat wooden shield, a bolo, and a long bamboo spear with a sharp,\nflat, iron point, completed his equipment for battle.\n\nHere stood the first and the twentieth centuries side by side. The\nFilipino who had advanced only a stage beyond the condition of\nprimitive man with his knife, spear, and wooden shield, stood side by\nside with the American soldier, a representative of modern life with\nhis magazine rifle, his canteen, his knapsack,--with every article of\nhis clothing made to give him the highest possible efficiency as the\nunit of a military organization.\n\nA few yards farther on we met another guard equipped similarly to the\nfirst. Upon reaching the town, news had just been received that a\ndetachment of troops from another post had intercepted the ladrones\nand fought a skirmish with them. The ladrones had escaped and we set\nout in pursuit of them on a chase wilder than a Quixotic dream. We\nwound our way into the mountains behind the town, inquiring at every\ngrass hut we passed whether the band of ladrones had passed that way,\nbut only once was even a trace of them found. Then it was learned that\nat a certain place they had separated into groups of three or four and\ngone glimmering through the dream of things that were. This place was\nin a secluded nook of the mountains where in years gone by some\nadventurous Spaniard had erected a primitive water mill to grind his\nsugar-cane. We had now marched about twenty miles and the feet of the\npedagogues were a mass of blisters. They had reached the point where\nthat form of military maneuvering called \"hiking\" ceased to possess\nany alluring charms. So a native was persuaded to come out of his lone\nmountain hut and hitch up his carabao and cart. He was then made to\nget on the carabao's back, while the aforesaid pedagogues lay down on\nthe sugar-cane pulp that had been put into the body of the cart, and\nthe driver was instructed to start for the post we had left hours\nbefore, and not to stop until he got there. Being uncertain but that\nsome of the ladrones would learn of our having left the body of troops\nand would try the metal of our steel, we at first agreed that neither\nof us should go to sleep, but it was later decided that probably the\ndriver had no greater desire to cross the Styx than his passengers had\nand that in case of danger he would awaken us, so both took a revolver\nin each hand, stretched out supinely and went to sleep.\n\nSuch a sleep! The rough jolting of the cart over an almost impassable\nroad was never enough to break the spell of slumber. When we awoke the\nblazing tropic sun was past the midday mark of morning, shining full\ninto our unprotected and well-nigh blistered faces.\n\nA pack of dogs were heralding our approach to a little village at the\nfoot of the mountains where ponies were procured to take us back to\nthe post."

                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently\nno time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth dimension of Space\nas a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house\nbecame quite quiet.\n\nOn reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up\nagainst a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realize\nhis position. Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\nhundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the\nDowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone\ninto hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains on\none of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who\nhad been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr\nto nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair\nby the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six\nweeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become\nreconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that\nnotorious sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible\nnight when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his\ndressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and\nconfessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox\nout of \u00a350,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card, and swore that\nthe ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back\nto him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because\nhe had seen a green hand tapping at the window-pane, to the beautiful\nLady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round\nher throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin,\nand who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of the\nKing's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he went\nover his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as\nhe recalled to mind his last appearance as \"Red Reuben, or the Strangled\nBabe,\" his d\u00e9but as \"Guant Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,\"\n\nand the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely\nplaying ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And\nafter all this some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him\nthe Rising Sun Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite\nunbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever been treated in this\nmanner. Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance, and remained till\ndaylight in an attitude of deep thought.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III\n\n\nThe next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed\nthe ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. \"I have\nno wish,\" he said, \"to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say\nthat, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,\"--a very just remark,\nat which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.\n\n\"Upon the other hand,\" he continued, \"if he really declines to use the\nRising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him. It\nwould be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside\nthe bedrooms.\"\n\nFor the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the\nblood-stain on the library floor. This certainly was very strange, as\nthe door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept\nclosely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a\ngood deal of comment. Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red,\nthen it would be vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came\ndown for family prayers, according to the simple rites of the Free\nAmerican Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright\nemerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party\nvery much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening. The\nonly person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia, who,\nfor some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the\nsight of the blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was\nemerald-green.\n\nThe second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in\nthe hall. Rushing down-stairs, they found that a large suit of old\narmour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone\nfloor, while seated in a high-backed chair was the Canterville ghost,\nrubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face. The\ntwins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged\ntwo pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained\nby long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United\nStates Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in\naccordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost\nstarted up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a\nmist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so\nleaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase\nhe recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of\ndemoniac laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely\nuseful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single\nnight, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French\ngovernesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly\nlaughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and\nrang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door\nopened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown. \"I am\nafraid you are far from well,\" she said, \"and have brought you a bottle\nof Doctor Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a\nmost excellent remedy.\" The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at\nonce to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an\naccomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family\ndoctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's\nuncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps,\nhowever, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself\nwith becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep\nchurchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.\n\nOn reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the\nmost violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross\nmaterialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what\nreally distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit\nof mail. He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by\nthe sight of a Spectre in armour, if for no more sensible reason, at\nleast out of respect for their natural poet Longfellow, over whose\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\nhour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides it was his own suit.\n\nHe had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament, and had\nbeen highly complimented on it by no less a person than the Virgin Queen\nherself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely overpowered\nby the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen\nheavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees severely, and\nbruising the knuckles of his right hand.\n\nFor some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of\nhis room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.\n\nHowever, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to\nmake a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his\nfamily. He selected Friday, August 17th, for his appearance, and spent\nmost of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in\nfavour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet\nfrilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards evening a\nviolent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was\njust such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to\nmake his way quietly to Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the\nfoot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\nof low music. He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville\nblood-stain by means of Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent. Having reduced\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and\nhis wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead,\nwhile he hissed into her trembling husband's ear the awful secrets of\nthe charnel-house. With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made\nup his mind. She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and\ngentle. A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more\nthan sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the\ncounterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins, he was quite\ndetermined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be done was, of\ncourse, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling\nsensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each\nother, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse,\ntill they became paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw off the\nwinding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white, bleached bones and\none rolling eyeball, in the character of \"Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's\nSkeleton,\" a r\u00f4le in which he had on more than one occasion produced a\ngreat effect, and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of\n\"Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.\"\n\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the\nlight-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves\nbefore they retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still,\nand, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the\nwindow-panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family\nslept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\ncould hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States. He\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his\nmurdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like\nan evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.\n\nOnce he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only\nthe baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange\nsixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\nin the midnight air. Finally he reached the corner of the passage that\nled to luckless Washington's room. For a moment he paused there, the\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's\nshroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was\ncome. He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had\nhe done so than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid\nhis blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was\nstanding a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous\nas a madman's dream! Its head was bald and burnished; its face round,\nand fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\nfeatures into an eternal grin. From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\nlight, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like\nto his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form. On its breast\nwas a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of\nshame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime,\nand, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\n\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's\njack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler. Once in the\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small\npallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes. After a time, however,\nthe brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to\ngo and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight. Accordingly,\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling\nthat, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid\nof his new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins. On reaching\nthe spot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had\nevidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from\nits hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it\nwas leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable\nattitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his\nhorror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a\nrecumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity\nbed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow\nturnip lying at his feet! Unable to understand this curious\ntransformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there,\nin the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:--\n        +------------------------------------+\n        |         YE OTIS GHOSTE             |\n        | Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook, |\n        |    Beware of Ye Imitationes.       |\n        |   All others are counterfeite.     |\n        +------------------------------------+\nThe whole thing flashed across him. He had been tricked, foiled, and\nout-witted! The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his\ntoothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his\nhead, swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\nschool, that, when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds\nof blood would be wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.\n\nHardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of\na distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh,\nand waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\nreason, did not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back\nto his room, thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose. There he\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was\nexceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which this oath\nhad been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second time. \"Perdition\nseize the naughty fowl,\" he muttered, \"I have seen the day when, with my\nstout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow\nfor me an 'twere in death!\" He then retired to a comfortable lead\ncoffin, and stayed there till evening.\n\n\nCHAPTER: IV\n\n\nThe next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were\ncompletely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five\ndays he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point\nof the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want\nit, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a\nlow, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating\nthe symbolic value of sensuous phenomena. The question of phantasmic\napparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a\ndifferent matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large\noriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every month, and he\ndid not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is\nquite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand,\nhe was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.\n\nFor the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as\nusual between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible\nprecaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots,\ntrod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large\nblack velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for\noiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good\ndeal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of\nprotection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he\nslipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a\nlittle humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see\nthat there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a\ncertain degree, it served his purpose. Still in spite of everything he\nwas not left unmolested. Strings were continually being stretched across\nthe corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion,\nwhile dressed for the part of \"Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley\nWoods,\" he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide,\nwhich the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry\nChamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged\nhim, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and\nsocial position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the\nnext night in his celebrated character of \"Reckless Rupert, or the\nHeadless Earl.\"\n\nHe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in\nfact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means\nof it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord\nCanterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome\nJack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\ndown the terrace at twilight. Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\nLord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken\nheart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it\nhad been a great success. It was, however an extremely difficult\n\"make-up,\" if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more\nscientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three\nhours to make his preparations. At last everything was ready, and he was\nvery pleased with his appearance. The big leather riding-boots that went\nwith the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\nfind one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite\nsatisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting\nand crept down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins,\nwhich I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of\nthe colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make\nan effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water\nfell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his\nleft shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed. The shock to his\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\ncould go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold. The only\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\nhad not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences\nmight have been very serious.\n\nHe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,\nand contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in\nlist slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\ndraughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the\ntwins. The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September. He\nhad gone down-stairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that\nthere, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing\nhimself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of\nthe United States Minister and his wife which had now taken the place of\nthe Canterville family pictures. He was simply but neatly clad in a long\nshroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip\nof yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In\nfact, he was dressed for the character of \"Jonas the Graveless, or the\nCorpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,\" one of his most remarkable\nimpersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to\nremember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their\nneighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a quarter-past two o'clock in\nthe morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring. As\nhe was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any\ntraces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a\ndark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads,\nand shrieked out \"BOO!\" in his ear.\n\nSeized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural,\nhe rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him\nthere with the big garden-syringe, and being thus hemmed in by his\nenemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the\ngreat iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to\nmake his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own\nroom in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.\n\nAfter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins\nlay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\nservants, but it was of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings\nwere so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed\nhis great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had\nbeen engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized a wonderful\nclam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse\neuchre, poker, and other American national games, and Virginia rode\nabout the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire,\nwho had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville\nChase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in\nfact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who,\nin reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best\ncongratulations to the Minister's worthy wife.\n\nThe Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the\nhouse, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let\nmatters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the\nyoung Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had\nonce bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice\nwith the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the\nfloor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state that, though\nhe lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but\n\"Double Sixes.\" The story was well known at the time, though, of course,\nout of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt\nwas made to hush it up, and a full account of all the circumstances\nconnected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle's\nRecollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends. The ghost, then,\nwas naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence\nover the Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his\nown first cousin having been married en secondes noces to the Sieur de\nBulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are\nlineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to\nVirginia's little lover in his celebrated impersonation of \"The Vampire\nMonk, or the Bloodless Benedictine,\" a performance so horrible that when\nold Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in\nthe year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which\nculminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after\ndisinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and\nleaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment,\nhowever, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the\nlittle Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal\nBedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.\n\n\nCHAPTER: V\n\n\nA few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out\nriding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting\nthrough a hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go\nup by the back staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past\nthe Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied\nshe saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother's maid, who\nsometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend\nher habit. To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville\nGhost himself! He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of\nthe yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing\nmadly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his hand, and his\nwhole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so forlorn, and so\nmuch out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea\nhad been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity,\nand determined to try and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so\ndeep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she\nspoke to him.\n\n\"I am so sorry for you,\" she said, \"but my brothers are going back to\nEton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy\nyou.\"\n\n\"It is absurd asking me to behave myself,\" he answered, looking round in\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,\n\"quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and\nwalk about at night, if that is what you mean. It is my only reason for\nexisting.\"\n\n\"It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very\nwicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had\nkilled your wife.\"\n\n\"Well, I quite admit it,\" said the Ghost, petulantly, \"but it was a\npurely family matter, and concerned no one else.\"\n\n\"It is very wrong to kill any one,\" said Virginia, who at times had a\nsweet puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.\n\n\"Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very\nplain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about\ncookery. Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent\npricket, and do you know how she had it sent to table? However, it is\nno matter now, for it is all over, and I don't think it was very nice of\nher brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.\"\n\n\"Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost--I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry? I\nhave a sandwich in my case. Would you like it?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you,\nall the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\nvulgar, dishonest family.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Virginia, stamping her foot, \"it is you who are rude, and\nhorrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the\npaints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain\nin the library. First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and\nI couldn't do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the\nchrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese\nwhite, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing\nto look at, and not at all easy to paint. I never told on you, though I\nwas very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for\nwho ever heard of emerald-green blood?\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" said the Ghost, rather meekly, \"what was I to do? It is\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother\nbegan it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I\nshould not have your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of\ntaste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest\nin England; but I know you Americans don't care for things of this\nkind.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\nand improve your mind. My father will be only too happy to give you a\nfree passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind,\nthere will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are\nall Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\nhave a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family ghost.\"\n\n\"I don't think I should like America.\"\n\n\"I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,\" said Virginia,\nsatirically.\n\n\"No ruins! no curiosities!\" answered the Ghost; \"you have your navy and\nyour manners.\"\n\n\"Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week's\nholiday.\"\n\n\"Please don't go, Miss Virginia,\" he cried; \"I am so lonely and so\nunhappy, and I really don't know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I\ncannot.\"\n\n\"That's quite absurd! You have merely to go to bed and blow out the\ncandle. It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\nchurch, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why, even\nbabies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.\"\n\n\"I have not slept for three hundred years,\" he said sadly, and\nVirginia's beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; \"for three hundred\nyears I have not slept, and I am so tired.\"\n\nVirginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like\nrose-leaves. She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked\nup into his old withered face.\n\n\"Poor, poor Ghost,\" she murmured; \"have you no place where you can\nsleep?\"\n\n\"Far away beyond the pine-woods,\" he answered, in a low, dreamy voice,\n\"there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\nsings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold crystal\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\nsleepers.\"\n\nVirginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\n\n\"You mean the Garden of Death,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth,\nwith the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have\nno yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at\npeace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of death's\nhouse, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death\nis.\"\n\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\nthere was silence. She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\n\nThen the ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of\nthe wind.\n\n\"Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?\"\n\n\"Oh, often,\" cried the little girl, looking up; \"I know it quite well.\n\nIt is painted in curious black letters, and is difficult to read. There\nare only six lines:\n    \"'When a golden girl can win\n    Prayer from out the lips of sin,\n    When the barren almond bears,\n    And a little child gives away its tears,\n    Then shall all the house be still\n    And peace come to Canterville.'\n\n\"But I don't know what they mean.\"\n\n\"They mean,\" he said, sadly, \"that you must weep with me for my sins,\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle,\nthe angel of death will have mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\ncannot prevail.\"\n\nVirginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair\nas he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes. \"I am not afraid,\" she said\nfirmly, \"and I will ask the angel to have mercy on you.\"\n\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as\nhe led her across the dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were\nbroidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back. \"Go back! little Virginia,\"\n\nthey cried, \"go back!\" but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly,\nand she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails\nand goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and\nmurmured, \"Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,\"\n\nbut the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When\nthey reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she\ncould not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly\nfading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A\nbitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her\ndress. \"Quick, quick,\" cried the Ghost, \"or it will be too late,\" and\nin a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry\nChamber was empty.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VI\n\n\nAbout ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not\ncome down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia\nanywhere. As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\nevening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all\nalarmed at first, but when six o'clock struck, and Virginia did not\nappear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for\nher, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house. At\nhalf-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\nof their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of\nexcitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly\nremembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies\npermission to camp in the park. He accordingly at once set off for\nBlackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son\nand two of the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire, who was\nperfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too,\nbut Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a\nscuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gipsies had\ngone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as\nthe fire was still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.\n\nHaving sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran\nhome, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the\ncounty, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been\nkidnapped by tramps or gipsies. He then ordered his horse to be brought\nround, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down\nto dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with a groom. He had hardly,\nhowever, gone a couple of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after\nhim, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with\nhis face very flushed, and no hat. \"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,\" gasped\nout the boy, \"but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.\n\nPlease don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year,\nthere would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me back,\nwill you? I can't go! I won't go!\"\n\nThe Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace,\nand was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down\nfrom his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, \"Well,\nCecil, if you won't go back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must\nget you a hat at Ascot.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!\" cried the little Duke, laughing,\nand they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of\nthe station-master if any one answering to the description of Virginia\nhad been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her. The\nstation-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him\nthat a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a\nhat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his\nshutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away,\nwhich he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as there was a\nlarge common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman, but\ncould get no information from him, and, after riding all over the\ncommon, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase\nabout eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found\nWashington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with\nlanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest trace of\nVirginia had been discovered. The gipsies had been caught on Brockley\nmeadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they should be late. Indeed, they had\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's disappearance, as they\nwere very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his\npark, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search.\n\nThe carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone\nover, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any\nrate, Virginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest\ndepression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they\nfound a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\nwas poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and\nhaving her forehead bathed with eau de cologne by the old housekeeper.\n\nMr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up\nsupper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one\nspoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very\nfond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the\nentreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that\nnothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in\nthe morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down\nimmediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight\nbegan to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded\nthey heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder\nshook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a\npanel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out\non the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her\nhand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs.\nOtis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with\nviolent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.\n\n\"Good heavens! child, where have you been?\" said Mr. Otis, rather\nangrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them.\n\n\"Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and\nyour mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these\npractical jokes any more.\"\n\n\"Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!\" shrieked the twins, as they\ncapered about.\n\n\"My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side\nagain,\" murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair.\n\n\"Papa,\" said Virginia, quietly, \"I have been with the Ghost. He is dead,\nand you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was\nreally sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of\nbeautiful jewels before he died.\"\n\nThe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave\nand serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a\nlighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they\ncame to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia\ntouched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves\nin a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated\nwindow. Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was\na gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone\nfloor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers\nan old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its\nreach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was\ncovered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but\na pile of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding\nher little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the\nparty looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\ndisclosed to them.\n\n\"Hallo!\" suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out\nof the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\nsituated. \"Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.\"\n\n\"God has forgiven him,\" said Virginia, gravely, as she rose to her feet,\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.\n\n\"What an angel you are!\" cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round\nher neck, and kissed her.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VII\n\n\nFour days after these curious incidents, a funeral started from\nCanterville Chase at about eleven o'clock at night. The hearse was drawn\nby eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\nnodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\npurple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville\ncoat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\nservants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully\nimpressive. Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up\nspecially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first\ncarriage along with little Virginia. Then came the United States\nMinister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the\nlast carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had\nbeen frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she\nhad a right to see the last of him. A deep grave had been dug in the\ncorner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service\nwas read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, the servants, according to an old custom\nobserved in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as\nthe coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward,\nand laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms. As\nshe did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its\nsilent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a\nnightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of the\nGarden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a\nword during the drive home.\n\nThe next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given\nto Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby\nnecklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen\nof sixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis\nfelt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"I know that in this country mortmain is held to\napply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that\nthese jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg\nyou, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you\nunder certain strange conditions. As for my daughter, she is merely a\nchild, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such\nappurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I\nmay say, is no mean authority upon Art,--having had the privilege of\nspending several winters in Boston when she was a girl,--that these gems\nare of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\nprice. Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you\nwill recognize how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\nin the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such\nvain gauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\nBritish aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who\nhave been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles\nof Republican simplicity. Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box, as a memento of\nyour unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is extremely old, and\nconsequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to\ncomply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good deal\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with medi\u00e6valism\nin any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was\nborn in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned\nfrom a trip to Athens.\"\n\nLord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister's speech,\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile,\nand when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\nsaid: \"My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky\nancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are\nmuch indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck. The jewels\nare clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough\nto take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave\nin a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. As for their being\nheirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or\nlegal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite\nunknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and\nwhen Miss Virginia grows up, I dare say she will be pleased to have\npretty things to wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the\nfurniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to\nthe ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity\nSir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he\nwas really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase.\"\n\nMr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville's refusal, and\nbegged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was\nquite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to\nretain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of\n1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's first\ndrawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the\nuniversal theme of admiration. For Virginia received the coronet, which\nis the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her\nboy-lover as soon as he came of age. They were both so charming, and\nthey loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the\nmatch, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch\nthe Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less\nthan three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to\nsay, Mr. Otis himself. Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke\npersonally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his\nown words, \"was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating\ninfluences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of\nRepublican simplicity should be forgotten.\" His objections, however,\nwere completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the\naisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his\narm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of\nEngland.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to\nCanterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over\nin the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods. There had\nbeen a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir\nSimon's tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it\nsimply the initials of the old gentleman's name, and the verse from the\nlibrary window. The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses,\nwhich she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for\nsome time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There\nthe Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her\nfeet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly\nhe threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her,\n\"Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.\"\n\n\"Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have,\" he answered, smiling, \"you have never told me what\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.\"\n\n\"I have never told any one, Cecil,\" said Virginia, gravely.\n\n\"I know that, but you might tell me.\"\n\n\"Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you. Poor Sir Simon! I owe\nhim a great deal. Yes, don't laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see\nwhat Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than\nboth.\"\n\nThe Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.\n\n\"You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,\" he murmured.\n\n\"You have always had that, Cecil.\"\n\n\"And you will tell our children some day, won't you?\"\n\nVirginia blushed.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.\n\nYet Millet would have us understand that in spite of this, the\nshepherd is performing a duty to humanity not to be underrated. The\nsheep he has so carefully and conscientiously reared will form food\nto-morrow for many a hungry town-dweller. Further, he would have us\nfollow the peasant as he closes the pen for the night and traces his\ntired steps towards his simple home in the village. The frugal and\nhard-earned meal, prepared for him by his wife, who like himself has\nhad her share of duties to occupy her during the day, is partaken of\nsurrounded by a hungry and joyous group of children. Such themes\nsuggested by the simplicity of his own life appealed to him with\nirresistible force, and it is in their portrayal that his greatness is\nmanifested.\n\nPerhaps no season of the year presented the same attraction for Millet\nas the spring. The period when all the earth after its long winter\nsleep is about to waken into new life seems to have always been a\nsource of inspiration to him. In \"The Sower\" he emphasises the fact\nthat the fruits of the harvest are not to be had without due labour\nbeing expended upon the earth. The sloping field, barren of\nvegetation, and crowned at the top with a small clump of trees, is\nbeing broken up by the distant plough drawn by two horses and guided\nby a peasant. The latter figure is one of the noblest of Millet's\ncreations. By his strained and ever-attentive attitude, by his\ncontinuous tramp over the rough and broken ground, he shows us the\nmonotony of his toil. He crosses the field in one direction, only to\nreturn at an interval of a few feet. In the foreground we have the\nsower, a middle-aged man of typical peasant type, on whose left side a\nbag of seeds is slung. With automatic precision he withdraws a\nhandful, and strews it into the furrows open to receive it. So long as\nhe continues in the same track his labour will be well performed, and\nhence his task is just as monotonous as that of his fellow-worker\nhigher up in the field. The silhouetting of these two figures against\nthe light is symbolical of the labour to be expended in life before\nresults are forthcoming.\n\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that in considering the works of\nMillet, one must not judge him from the standpoint of a mere painter.\n\nHis brush is only the means to an end, and by its means he is enabled\nto bring the fruits of his philosophic observation before us in\npermanent form. It has been charged against the \"Angelus\" that it was\nnot a remarkably fine piece of painting, that many a young artist of\nthe present generation is infinitely better equipped, technically\nspeaking, than the master who wrought this celebrated canvas. This may\nin a measure be true, but it must never be forgotten that Millet\nbrought into play exactly the means which could illustrate his meaning\nin the clearest terms. He had not intended, in painting such a\npicture, to produce a work which would astonish his fellow artists\nwith its brilliancy of handling or magnificence of colour. He wanted\nto make the beholder forget the painter and absorb the lesson. This\nquality runs right through the art of Millet, and it is from this\nstandpoint that we are obliged to weigh his merits.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE\n\n\nJean Fran\u00e7ois Millet was born on October 4, 1814, that is at the\nperiod when French art, at any rate as far as landscape painting is\nconcerned, had reached its lowest ebb. Throughout the eighteenth\ncentury the landscape painter had been hard put to make a living. The\ntaste of connoisseurs throughout the century had been for portraits\nand interiors, or for those numerous pastoral subjects which were\ncarried out with so much decorative charm by such men as Watteau and\nBoucher. Such landscape painting as existed was of the type\npopularised by Vernet; it was built upon a curious mixture of Italian\ninfluence coming from Panini and Salvator Rosa. The only evidence of\nrevolt against such a state of affairs we find in the works of Hubert\nRobert and Moreau. These two, and more especially would I direct the\nreader's attention to the latter, struggled hard to break down the\nconventionalities of the time. They endeavoured to infuse some sense\nof atmosphere into their pictures, and whilst frequently their trees\nand figures are painfully formal, they yet stand alone in the French\nschool as the pioneers of a phase of art which was to attain its\nzenith in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBut after the Revolution, and during the whole of the time that France\nwas under the domination of Napoleon, very rigid principles indeed\nwere enforced with regard to the direction that art should take. The\ninnovation which had its commencement in the reign of Louis XVI. swept\neverything before it as it gained force. Classical art and traditions\ndominated the whole French school, and no artist, however great his\nreputation, attempted for many years to swim against the stream. In\nspite of the principles of liberty and equality which were claimed for\nall under the new r\u00e9gime, a terribly strict eye was kept upon any\ninnovations which might break out in the form of a naturalistic art.\n\nThe directors of this new movement failed to see that the conditions\nwhich had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed\naway, and that the latter's supremacy was due to the fact that their\nproductions were symbolical of the loftiest thoughts of their own\nepoch. The art which expresses the ambitions and noblest thoughts of\nits time will alone endure. These expressions are not applicable to\nany other condition than those which called them forth, and hence in\nattempting to purify the rococo which had existed up to the middle of\nthe eighteenth century, by a return to classical traditions, they were\nonly copying that which their predecessors had done, and in so doing\nleft us without any original expression of their own time.\n\nInto such a condition of affairs was Millet born, and he was numbered\namongst that little band of men which included Rousseau, Corot, Dupr\u00e9,\nDiaz, and Daumier, who were to lay the foundations of the modern\nnaturalistic school. At the outset it was seemingly a hopeless\nstruggle they undertook; a struggle against prejudice and influence\nwhich was only to be brought to a victorious culmination after years\nof struggle and disappointment. Of this little band, Millet was\nperhaps the best equipped for the privations which were necessary. He\ncame of a peasant stock who inhabited Gruchy, a small village\nsituated in the commune of Gr\u00e9ville, close to Cherbourg. Grouped\nunderneath the humble roof was the grandmother, who had been left a\nwidow fifteen years before; her son, Jean Louis Nicolas Millet, and\nhis wife and eight children, of which our artist was the second. His\ngrandmother appears to have been a pious old lady, whose chief delight\nwas in her grandchildren, to whom she taught those religious\nprinciples which stood them in good stead in after life. We are told\nthat Millet's father possessed a force of character one does not often\nfind amongst men in his rank of life. He was of a contemplative\ndisposition, and had a keenly developed feeling for natural beauty. He\npossessed moreover a keen appreciation of music, which unfortunately\nhe does not appear to have had much opportunity of cultivating. His\nwife was an excellent housewife and of a religious turn of mind. The\nhouse they occupied, situated quite a short distance from the sea, was\nplaced in a tract of country which, whilst it had rugged and\npicturesque features, was not of a nature which would yield\nextraordinary results under cultivation. It was, therefore, a hard\nstruggle for existence which Millet in his first years saw going\non around him. Not that the family were any the less happy for having\nto work laboriously for their livelihood. They had been brought up\namidst such surroundings; their wants were simple and easily\ngratified, and the tranquillity of the m\u00e9nage more than\ncounterbalanced those doubtful luxuries which easier circumstances\nwould have brought their way. Throughout his life Millet maintained\nthe extreme simplicity he had seen practised in the home of his\nchildhood, and long years afterwards he was accustomed to look back\nwith pleasureable memories upon his early years.\n\nGruchy, situated in one of the wildest parts of Normandy, feels the\nfull effect of every storm which blows up from the Atlantic. There is\nnothing to shelter the exposed hamlets studded along the coast from\nthe fury of the western gale, and the rocks are but too often strewn\nwith the wrecks of vessels which have come to grief in that terrible\nsea. Millet in his youth must have witnessed many of these\ncatastrophes. Quite a number of drawings by him are extant\nrepresenting succour being extended to some vessel in difficulties, or\nthe hauling up of some wreckage on to the rocks. The studious boy\nmust have been impressed as he saw the sternness of the combat in his\nnative country between men and nature; the wind-swept fields, and\nhills bare to the point of savageness. The very trees themselves\ndwarfed and gnarled; in their struggle with the elements they have\nbeen made tough and hardy as the inhabitants of the country\nthemselves, and, stunted as they are, yet show well that they can\nresist the force of the fiercest storm. The brooding and contemplative\ncharacter of the father having descended to the son, we can quite\nimagine the effect such surroundings would have upon him. As he looked\nback in after years upon his roamings in his native country, he\nappreciated the awe-inspiring character of the scenery in which he had\nbeen born. He would doubtless recall many a walk amidst the fields\nwith the wind blowing in his face as it rushed in from the Atlantic,\nthe rain beating hard upon the freshly ploughed fields, and the\ndistant figure of the ploughman struggling hard with his team against\nthe stiff sou'wester. The great mass of vapour overhead whirled before\nthe violence of the storm, casting grey and pearly light over the\nwhole scene, whilst far away on the top of the hill a clump of trees,\nbent with their resistance to the wind, are silhouetted against the\nsky. Many a drawing of this kind we encounter in the later work of\nMillet, which shows how his thoughts harked back in certain moments to\nthe scenes he had left behind him for ever.\n\nWe know that on one or two occasions he returned to Gruchy. Once or\ntwice he had urgent business which took him back, but sometimes he\nwent with no other purpose than to renew acquaintance with the scenes\nof yore.\n\nLittle Jean Fran\u00e7ois was his grandmother's favourite. It was she who\ntaught him the names of things which surrounded him, and perhaps\ndirected his thoughts in the channels to which they were finally to be\ndevoted. Her brother Charles, who formed one of the family, used to\ntake him for walks, telling him stories on the way. Millet was\ndevotedly attached to this old man, and when at the age of seven years\nhe lost him, the gap in his life thus left made an impression upon his\nmemory never to be effaced.\n\nFive years afterwards he was placed in the hands of the vicar for the\npurpose of preparing him for his first communion. The good man seems\nto have been taken with the child; he found him so attentive to all\nnatural phenomenon which was passing around him and intelligent in an\nunusual degree. He quickly learnt a considerable amount of Latin,\nwhich introduced him to the great classics. Unfortunately for Millet,\nthe vicar accepted an offer of transference to a better parish in the\nvicinity. The boy had made such progress with his master that it was\ndecided that he should go with him to his new abode. He was, however,\nso missed in his own home, that when he came back for his first\nholidays it was decided that he should not return.\n\nHe now gave serious attention to the agricultural pursuits of his\nfather. He threw himself heartily into the work of the farm, and\nassisted in the work of sowing and harvesting, of pruning and\nthrashing according to the season. His spare time was occupied in\nreading with avidity various masterpieces of literature. The authors\nhe found at hand were such as F\u00e9n\u00e9lon and Bossuet, but he developed a\ndecided preference, which lasted till the end of his life, for Virgil\nand the Bible.\n\nIt was at this time that his taste for art began to be developed.\n\nHe drew the objects he found around him, and soon acquired sufficient\nconfidence in his skill to execute a large drawing representing two\nshepherds keeping guard over their sheep. These first efforts date\nfrom about his seventeenth year, and foretell the advent of the style\nin which he was later to become pre-eminent.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE MIGRATION TO PARIS\n\n\nHow frequently has it happened that the first years in the life of a\ngenius have been employed in labour quite different from that to which\nthey should have been directed. Such a state of affairs the more often\noccurs when the sense of duty has been strong enough to overcome\ntemporarily the inclination to pursue the natural bent. In the case of\nMillet, however, the early years which he devoted to the farm and its\npursuits were by no means wasted. It is on record that he became very\nproficient in the various duties in which he was engaged, but at the\nsame time we can be quite sure that his extraordinary faculties of\nobservation were constantly being brought into play, and the fruits of\nhis observations are to be seen in the pictures of his mature period.\n\nA considerable portion of his spare time was taken up with drawing,\nnot only the persons and objects he found around him, but also\nsubjects suggested to him by the books he was in the habit of reading.\n\nHis family, so far from throwing any obstacles in his way, encouraged\nhim. In fact it was his father who took him first to Cherbourg in\norder to show a painter of that town, named Mouchel, the early\nproducts of his son's genius. The decision at which Millet p\u00e8re had\narrived was prompted by a drawing in charcoal of an old peasant\nwalking along the road, which had struck him forcibly as being a work\nof extraordinary merit. It says much for Mouchel's breadth of mind\nthat he was equally impressed with the drawings. A man who had been\nbrought up in the school of David, and who had lived in one of the\nmost reactionary periods of French art, was hardly to be expected to\ntake kindly to a style so diametrically opposed to all the traditions\ninto which he himself had been inculcated; certainly the young\nMillet, who had now arrived at the age of eighteen, had not developed\nthe extraordinary freedom which his works of ten years later\ndemonstrate. But there was sufficient originality even in his early\ndrawings to call forth condemnation from a man who had been so\nsaturated with the teaching of David.\n\nHe prevailed upon Millet to leave his son with him, and set him to\nwork to copy many well-known works of art which he brought before his\npupil by means of engravings. Two months were spent in this way when\nnews reached Millet that his father had been seized with sudden\nillness, and he was obliged in the circumstances to return to\nGr\u00e9ville. He arrived to find the old man unconscious, and very shortly\nafterwards he died.\n\nThis misfortune awoke in Millet a sense of duty which compelled him to\ndesert his studies in Cherbourg and superintend the management of the\nfarm. For some time he devoted himself entirely to his new duties, but\nthe struggle betwixt duty and genius continued; he gave himself to his\nwork with all the energy at his disposal, but his thoughts were ever\nwandering to his art.\n\nAdded to his own inclinations, his grandmother, who perceived his\nextraordinary gifts, strongly persuaded him to devote his attention\nentirely to art, and consequently after some little time he decided to\nreturn to Cherbourg. Here he entered the studio of M. Langlois, an\nartist whose reputation in the town was considerable. Again in this\nworthy man he came in contact with a painter who had been brought up\nentirely under classical influence. Langlois, who had in his early\ndays been a pupil of Gros, had absorbed the classical tradition to\nsuch an extent as to be incapable of appreciating any other style. He\nappears to have endeavoured to mould Millet in his own method rather\nthan develop the latent genius which the latter possessed. The\nincompatibility of these two men speedily caused the younger to strike\nout in his own way. He saw more good in frequenting the museums and\nmaking copies of such works as appealed to him than in listening to\nthe advice of his teacher. All this occurred, however, without any\nbreach of friendship occurring. On the contrary, Langlois, after\nperceiving the futility of inducing his pupil to follow in his\nfootsteps, did all he could to advance his interests.\n\nBy means of his influence some of Millet's drawings were brought\nbefore the Municipal Council, and Langlois suggested that Millet\nshould be sent to Paris in order to further his development, and that\nthe Council should set aside a modest pension to meet his requirements\nin that city. The discussion appears to have been very prolonged, and\nupon the question being put to a vote it was only carried by means of\nthe casting vote of the mayor. Four hundred francs was at first\nallotted to him in this way, which was further increased shortly\nafterwards to six hundred. Such encouragement, meagre though it was,\nwas sufficient to give him a foothold in the metropolis. He left\nCherbourg in January 1837, on a cold and raw day, the snow falling\nheavily throughout the entire journey, and arrived in Paris in a very\ndisheartened condition. The miserable weather, coupled with the long\njourney in which he had had time to think of the small sum which lay\nbetween him and starvation, going to a city which he had never seen\nbefore, had all served to work upon his nerves, and he entered the\ngreat city sick at heart and very despondent.\n\nOne of the first visits he made after he was somewhat settled down in\nParis was to the Louvre. Here he was brought into contact for the\nfirst time with many masters, who were to mould his yet plastic\ntemperament into the form which enabled him to give to the world, in\nlater years, so many masterpieces. As I have said before, it was\nMantegna who first captivated him, and the influence of the mighty\nPaduan was never finally to be shaken off. Michel Angelo awed him with\nhis sublimity; his classical severity tempered with intense humanism,\nhis masculine strength, were bound to have their effect upon so\nserious a character as Millet. Strange as it may seem to those who are\nbut superficially acquainted with his art, and are only too apt to\njudge him by the influence he has had upon modern French painting, he\nwas fascinated with the antique. The traditions of Phidias and\nPraxiteles, in the form in which they had been transmitted through the\ngreatest minds of the Renaissance, were ever the factors which guided\nhim throughout his career. It was this same spirit which impelled his\nfervid admiration for Nicolas Poussin, a master who to-day is sadly\nunderrated and but little understood. It was the mysteries of line,\nthe wonders of pose and composition rather than the magic of colour\nwhich appealed to him. He had a profound admiration for the glowing\ncanvases of Titian and Rubens, but he could never overlook entirely\ntheir defects of drawing or, in the case of Rubens, the tendency to\nvulgarity. From his remarks in after years it would appear that he was\nbaffled with the mysticisms of Velazquez and Rembrandt; pure painting\nitself could never hold him. He needed to grasp the message which lay\nbehind it before he felt fully taken into the confidence of the\npainter; and as the minds of the Dutchman and the Spaniard ran in\nquite different channels to his own, they spoke with a language he\nnever understood. That he had a perceptive and critically independent\nmind may be gauged from his enthusiasm for Delacroix, whose work he\nencountered for the first time at the Luxembourg.\n\nDuring this period of study he was carefully considering under what\nmaster he should place himself. His choice unhappily fell upon\nDelaroche. To any one acquainted with the work of the latter master,\na more unsuitable selection could not have been made. Delaroche and\nthe painters who surrounded him can be appropriately described as\nconstituting the back-wash of the Empire style, which had reached its\nclimax with David. His subjects were always treated with academic\nreserve. No pyrotechnics were permitted; on the contrary, an\neverlasting and mistaken striving for finish was encouraged:\noriginality was sternly suppressed. To paint human life as it really\nwas, was too vulgar for any of the painters of this time. They held\nthe public taste enslaved for years. An innovator such as Millet was\ndestined to become found his position almost untenable. The band of\ncritics and painters formed a monopoly which it seemed almost\nimpossible to break down, and it was only after years of bitter and\ndetermined struggle that the school of nature finally routed its\nopponent.\n\nDelaroche doubtlessly found the peasant painter a little rude both in\nhis person and in his ideas about art. He paid but little attention to\nthe young man who had placed himself in his hands, and devoted all his\ntime to students who were more amenable to his influence. A\ntemperament so sensitive as Millet's was bound to notice this\nneglect, and consequently after a time he became so discouraged that\nhe ceased to frequent Delaroche's studio. Another very good reason for\nthis action was the lack of resources to continue his payments. Even\nduring the time he had been with Delaroche he lost no opportunity of\nturning a few honest francs by painting the portraits of any who could\nbe got to sit to him. Delaroche, however, had a more kindly heart than\nMillet imagined. He seems to have found out the real distress of the\nyoung artist, and to have assisted him pecuniarily in many ways, and\nthere is no doubt that he appreciated the talent of the young Norman\nmuch more than he cared to own. Many of his remarks on record would\nserve to show that Delaroche already felt that his pupil was destined\nto be one of the leaders of the movement which was finally to\noverthrow his own style, and doubtlessly felt a great admiration for a\nman who had the courage and strength to swim against rather than with\nthe current.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STRUGGLE FOR RECOGNITION\n\n\nFreed from all encumbrances save poverty, Millet was now to work out\nhis own destiny according to the dictates of his genius. He joined a\nfriend named Marolle, and the two together occupying a very small\napartment endeavoured to eke out an existence. It was only too soon\napparent that young as he was, and the taste of the public being not\nyet ready for development upon the lines his genius directed him, that\nhis livelihood could not be secured by endeavouring to sell such\nsubjects as appealed to him. In these straits he turned to\nportrait-painting, just as many great painters before and since him\nhave done. That the struggle was very keen can well be imagined by the\nfact that he was unable to obtain more than five to ten francs apiece;\nand, as commissions were very scarce, he was hard put to gain the\nmeans of subsistence. This state of affairs lasted until 1840, in\nwhich year he endeavoured to obtain admission to the Salon with two\nportraits, one of which was that of his friend. This, however, was\nrejected, and the other picture, although accepted, was unnoticed by\neither the critics or the public.\n\nHaving occasion the next year to pay a visit to Cherbourg, he felt\nobliged to report himself to the Municipal Council who had had the\ngenerosity to send him in the first place to Paris. Its worthy members\nexpressed themselves as but little satisfied with the result of their\ninvestment; they claimed that they had had as yet but little to show\nfor their money, and they suggested, partly as a means of\ndemonstrating that they had had some little return, and also, in order\nto see of what stuff their prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was made, that he should paint a\nportrait of the recently deceased mayor. As Millet had not been\npersonally acquainted with that worthy citizen, and as the only guide\nwhich could be supplied him was a portrait made in miniature when he\nwas a young man of some twenty-three or twenty-four years of age, the\ntask was by no means easy. However, the artist set to work with a\nwill, and finally accomplished the picture to his own satisfaction.\n\nUpon it being shown to the Council, one and all declared, as any one\nwith the slightest knowledge of such matters could have told them\nbefore it was commenced, that it bore not the least resemblance to the\ndefunct magistrate. They therefore demurred at the three hundred\nfrancs they had agreed to pay him for the portrait, and offered him\none-third of that amount instead. Millet was deeply offended by the\ninsult, and informed the Council that he made them a present of the\npicture.\n\nIt was during this short visit to his native country that he met his\nfirst wife, a Mlle. Ono, whose portrait he had painted. From the first\nshe was very delicate, and he lost her after much suffering, three\nyears later. His second wife was Mlle. Catherine Lemaire, who was\ndestined to be the companion of his struggles until the end of his\nlife.\n\nMeanwhile Millet was occupied with subjects which he thought would\nappeal to the general public. A number of classical pictures date from\nthis epoch. It was an endeavour on his part to fall in as far as\npossible with the current taste, and so supply means of subsistence\nfor his family. At the same time he did not neglect his favourite\nsubjects, and many are the wonderful studies of peasant life which\ndate from these years. His reputation had so far advanced that he was\noffered the position of teacher of drawing in the college at\nCherbourg. It must have been only after prolonged deliberation that he\nrefused the proffered post. Here a certain annual stipend was assured\nhim, and if it was not large in itself it would at any rate suffice to\nkeep the wolf from the door. He preferred, however, to return to Paris\nand work out his own destiny as best he might.\n\nMillet, who lived at this time in the Rue Rochechouart, began to\nsurround himself with that little group of friends who remained\nfaithful to him until the end of his career. Amongst the earliest were\nCharles Jacque and Diaz: the latter had several clients amongst the\nsmall dealers, whom he induced to visit Millet's studio and make now\nand again a small purchase.\n\nMillet now became a fairly regular contributor to the Salon, but\ngenerally sent some classical or religious picture as well as one of\nhis peasant subjects. For example, in 1848 he sent the marvellous\nstudy of \"The Winnower,\" which we all know so well, accompanied by a\ncanvas, \"The Captivity of the Jews at Babylon.\" The latter, however,\nwas so badly received that he utilised the canvas upon its return for\na large picture of a \"Shepherdess tending her Sheep.\"\n\nIn spite of the headway that he was making, the struggle for existence\nseemed keener than ever, and but for the kindness of friends he and\nhis family would frequently have actually wanted for food. A timely\nadvance of one hundred francs obtained for him from the Minister of\nFine Arts, together with a commission from the State, for which he was\npaid the sum of eighteen hundred francs, were for some time the only\nrelief he obtained from his embarrassments. That he was not particular\nas to how he earned his daily bread is apparent from the fact that he\ndid not despise an order for a shop sign for a midwife, for which he\nwas paid the miserable amount of thirty francs.\n\nThe year 1848 was not an encouraging one for a painter who was\nstanding on the threshold of his career. The whole of Europe was\nseething with revolution. A repetition of the fearful year of 1792 was\neverywhere expected. The struggle betwixt reaction and property on the\none hand, and lawlessness and revolution on the other, was being waged\nwith grim determination. The issue was for long in the balance. One\nnever knew from one day to another what was going to happen. In such a\ndeplorable state of affairs men's minds were running on politics and\nwars rather than upon art. Millet amongst the rest was called upon to\nshoulder the musket, and it can be easily imagined with what\nreluctance he did so.\n\nParis, the great centre of art, had yet not afforded him much\nencouragement. Life was dear in the big city, and surrounded on all\nsides by bricks and mortar he was not free to go out into the fields\nand study the objects which were uppermost in his mind. He resolved to\nescape from it, and once having put the plan into execution he never\nreturned.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET IN HIS MATURITY\n\n\nThe Barbizon of 1850 was a very different place from the Barbizon of\nto-day. The world fame of the men who passed a quiet and strenuous\nexistence in the little village has transformed it into a tourist\nresort, with restaurants and caf\u00e9s, the stopping-places for\nwaggonettes which in summer bring their daily load of sightseers,\neager to see the homes of the painters whose names are now household\nwords.\n\nIt would have been well-nigh impossible for the little band to have\nchosen a more suitable spot for their labours. Rousseau and Millet,\nmuch as they were drawn towards each other by the tie of a sympathetic\ndisposition and by their common interest in art, yet were widely\ndissimilar from one another in their outlook upon art and their\nmethods of worship at the common shrine. Rousseau--one can see it from\nevery picture he painted--loved with all the yearning of a passionate\nand restless temperament the inanimate in Nature. Observe with what\nfidelity he draws his trees, with what caressing tenderness his clouds\nand skies are treated; solitude appealed to him above all things, and\nif here and there he was obliged to insert a few figures to complete\nhis composition, one instinctively feels that he would rather have\nsubstituted a group of cattle or a flock of sheep. In the glades of\nthe forest, far from the busy haunts of men, with the glorious\nsunlight penetrating from above, the breeze moaning through the\nbranches, he was happy. A wild and turbulent temperament such as his\nnot infrequently discovers exquisite enjoyment amidst such perfect\ntranquillity.\n\nBarbizon, situated on the fringe of the great forest of Fontainebleau,\ntherefore, permitted Rousseau to come into daily contact with the\nscenes which so appealed to him.\n\nMillet, on the other hand, was absorbed in the peasant. The man who\ntilled the soil and raised the produce humanity requires for its\nsubsistence by the sweat of his brow; the manifold duties of the\nlabourer, his life and sorrows, appealed to him with irresistible\nforce. An unpeopled track of wild and uncultivated land would not call\nforth any emotion in him, no matter how sublime the scenery might be.\n\nThe life of the village, spreading itself into the vast and fertile\nplain behind, held him absorbed; a peasant himself and living amongst\nthe people he so loved, he was in a position to bring before an\nunthinking world the poignant monotony of their useful lives.\n\nUpon their first arrival at Barbizon, the two artists put up at a\nsmall inn, working all day in a tiny place they had rented from some\npeasants and fitted up as a studio. The inconveniences of this\narrangement were soon apparent, and shortly afterwards Millet took a\nsmall house which was destined to be his abode for the remainder of\nhis life; an old barn in the immediate vicinity meanwhile provided him\nwith an excellent studio.\n\nFrom this period onward we must date the greatest productions of the\nmaster, the works which have induced more thought than those of any\nother peasant painter. A peasant among peasants, his life was of the\nmost rigid simplicity. Behind his little abode a large garden\nstretched away almost to the fringe of the forest itself, and here he\nwas accustomed to work every morning, growing a portion of the food\nnecessary to the sustenance of his family. The afternoon he devoted to\npainting, whilst the evening was given over to intercourse with his\nlittle circle of friends. The simplicity and tranquillity of his life\naroused the whole of his powers to action, and surrounded with\neverything he valued in life he was supremely happy.\n\nThe country around Barbizon appealed to him irresistibly. The\ntimber-studded plains, the gently undulating, highly cultivated\nfields, presented a strange contrast to the wild and rugged country\namidst which he had spent his childhood, and no doubt conduced to the\ndevelopment of a more refined and contemplative style than he would\notherwise have acquired. Upon his few visits to his native country he\nappears to have been more impressed than ever with its austerity, and\nthe drawings which these journeys called forth bore ample evidence of\nthis feeling in him.\n\nLack of the necessary funds to carry on even his simple m\u00e9nage was\never the bane of Millet's life. On many occasions Sensier, his\nintimate friend and afterwards his biographer, informs us he dissuaded\nhim from suicide.\n\nThe sums that he owed, small though they were, rendered him in\nconstant fear of the brokers. With creditors so importunate in their\ndemands for satisfaction, and with the constant lack of recognition,\nwhich was his lot, it is astonishing that Millet achieved so much. He\nwas relieved more than once by the kind-hearted and ever faithful\nRousseau, who when his friend was sorest pressed found some delicately\nhidden means to relieve him. It was he who acquired for 4000 francs\nthe wonderful \"Peasant grafting a Tree,\" when the picture failed to\nfind a purchaser; and in order that Millet should not be aware of his\ngenerosity, he made the offer in the name of an imaginary American.\n\nThis sort of goodness he repeated more than once, and it redounds\nstill more to his credit when we remember that Rousseau himself was\nnot infrequently in pecuniary difficulties.\n\nA constant succession of important works made their appearance during\nthe first ten years Millet spent at Barbizon. The first was the\nwell-known \"Sower,\" which has ever been one of the most popular of his\npictures. Then came the far finer \"Peasants going to Work,\" which for\nmany years was in an English Collection. The \"Gleaners,\" perhaps the\nnoblest canvas the master ever painted, dates from 1857, in which year\nit was seen at the Salon; the celebrated \"Angelus\" followed it two\nyears later. The prices which Millet obtained for this series of\nremarkable works was fantastically small. The \"Gleaners\" brought him a\npaltry 2000 francs, whilst he accounted himself lucky to encounter an\namateur who gave him the same sum for the small \"Woman feeding Fowls.\"\n\nThe \"Angelus,\" which was never exhibited, was sold in the year it was\npainted to a Monsieur Feydeau, an architect, for 1800 francs. It then\npassed through several hands before the late Monsieur Secr\u00e9tan\ncompeted up to 160,000 francs before he became possessed of the prize\nat the John Wilson sale.\n\nThe purchase, however, proved a sound investment, for upon the\ndispersal of his collection it was knocked down for 553,000 francs to\na Monsieur Proust, acting on behalf of the French Government. The\nlatter, however, when they gave the commission to buy the picture, had\nno idea that such a high value would be placed upon it, and\nconsequently refused to ratify the sale; a syndicate now came upon the\nscene, who took it to America. The price, however, proved greater than\neven the millionaires of the States were prepared to give, and the\ncanvas again returned to France, where it found a resting-place in the\ncollection of Monsieur Chauchard, who paid the enormous sum of 800,000\nfrancs for its possession.\n\nIn 1859 Millet sent two works to the Salon, a \"Woman grazing her Cow,\"\nand \"Death and the Woodman.\" The latter, one of the most\nphilosophical of Millet's pictures, which to-day is the principal\nattraction of the Jacobsen Museum at Copenhagen, was rejected.\n\nDisappointments of this kind came with such systematic regularity to\nthe painter that he must have become proof against them. He always had\nbitter enemies amongst the critics, who never failed to pour abuse\nupon his method and his subjects. Even a number of his fellow artists\njoined in the chorus of disapproval. But the vehemence with which he\nwas attacked was striking evidence of the impression he was making and\nthe inward sense of his own powers; and the fact that he was working\nout his destiny according to the dictates of his own genius supported\nhim against this outpouring of prejudice and malice. The social side\nof life appealed to him more strongly as the years rolled on, and the\nmurmurings which had been heard in 1859 as to the socialistic\ntendencies of \"Death and the Woodman\" swelled to a roar when the\nstupendous \"Man with the Hoe\" was exhibited fourteen years later. The\nlatter, one of the most virile studies of depraved humanity which the\nworld has ever seen, has always been a favourite with social\nreformers, and has inspired one remarkable poem. Even his most\nimplacable critics were disarmed before this canvas; its power was\nmagnetic; it was an inspiration, soul moving and trenchant.\n\nHis financial difficulties never completely dispersed. At one time, in\norder to insure himself a little tranquillity, he made a contract with\ntwo speculators, whereby they were to become possessors of all the\nwork he produced for three years, in consideration of their assuring\nhim a thousand francs a month. A great number of Millet's finest\nproductions passed thus through their hands, including the \"Return\nfrom the Fields\" and the \"Man with the Hoe.\" The partners were not\nlong in quarrelling, and after a lawsuit had been fought, Millet was\nleft in the hands of a man who frequently would not or could not pay\nhim in ready money, and whose bills he was frequently forced to\ndiscount at considerable loss.\n\nOne little gleam of sunshine rendered his later days happy. This was a\ncommission from a Colmar banker, Monsieur Thomas by name, who required\nfour allegorical compositions representing the Seasons, to decorate\nhis rooms. The artist was overjoyed by this piece of good fortune,\nand immediately commenced a most conscientious study of such mural\ndecoration as was within reach, in order that he might do full justice\nto his patron. He paid frequent visits to Fontainebleau and the\nLouvre, and even desired a friend to inquire if he could not obtain\nreproductions of the frescoes at Herculaneum and Pompeii. In spite of\nall this elaborate preparation, the subjects were not such as appealed\nto his genius, and in spite of them being well and soundly painted, we\nare told that they presented no features which called for special\ncomment.\n\nHe found, however, a much more genial occupation in accomplishing a\nseries of drawings ordered by a Monsieur Gavet, who paid the artist\n1000, 700, and 450 francs each, according to their size. He made\naltogether ninety-five drawings in this way, and it is said that this\ngentleman had in his possession the finest work in black and white and\nwater-colour the artist ever executed.\n\nTowards the latter end of his life the death of dear relatives and\nfriends cast a sorrowful gloom over him. Amongst the latter Rousseau,\nwho expired in his presence on the 22nd of December 1867, was\nperhaps the loss which seemed to him hardest to bear. A staunch and\ntrusty friend, who was to be relied upon when his prospects seemed the\nmost hopeless, he had been one of the very few who had appreciated\nMillet's talents at their full worth, and who, moreover, scanty as his\nown means were, was ever ready to stretch out his hand to assist his\nstruggling friend.\n\nShortly afterwards Millet paid a visit to his patron, Herr Hartmann,\nat M\u00fcnster, and from here he went for a short time into Switzerland.\n\nUpon his return he devoted himself with great earnestness to work, and\nachieved a certain success at the Salons with his exhibits. The\noutbreak of the war with Germany caused him to migrate with his family\nto Cherbourg, where he thought he might continue to work, removed as\nfar as possible from the scenes of carnage and struggle which were\ngoing on farther east. Transported once more amongst the scenes of his\nchildhood, he felt an increased impetus to production, and when he\nreturned to Barbizon late in 1871, he brought with him a number of\ncanvases of the highest quality; conspicuous amongst them was the\nwonderful \"Gr\u00e9ville Church,\" now in the Louvre.\n\nThe anxieties of his troublous life were, however, beginning to show\ntheir effect upon his constitution; a persistent cough developed, and\nalthough an amelioration would occasionally occur, it was always\nsucceeded by a worse condition than before. His health suffered a\ngeneral decline, and he finally breathed his last on the 20th of\nJanuary 1875. He was buried in the little cemetery of Chailly, beside\nhis friend Rousseau, amidst the scenery they both loved so well.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE MAN AND HIS ART\n\n\nMillet is an instance of an artist working out his own destiny,\nimpelled by irresistible genius, in the teeth of seemingly\ninsurmountable obstacles. He started life with enormous disadvantages;\nwithout friends in influential circles to spread his fame or plead his\ncause; without money to enable him to outlive and triumph over the\nignorant fanaticism of critics and artists, so soaked in the\nconventionalised art of their time that they had not perception enough\nto appreciate the full meaning of that naturalistic movement, which\nwas finally to sweep away the quasi-classic art they boasted of with\nsuch bombastic effusion. The path was hard and thorny, and his triumph\nwas not finally consummated until after his death. He himself found\nhis only satisfaction in the fact that he had lived his life according\nto the dictates of his genius, and had achieved the maximum of which\nhe was capable.\n\nMillet and our own Cotman were somewhat kindred spirits; there is much\nmore affinity between the work of the two men than is apparent to any\none who has not closely studied them. The marvellous \"Breaking the\nClod,\" now happily permanently housed at the British Museum, betrays\nthe same tremendous conception and broad outlook which characterises\nmany a drawing of Millet's. Both highly strung to a painful extent,\nthey were each conscious of their inability to curb the power which\nprescribed a certain course for them, and in spite of pecuniary\ndifficulties and unpopularity, an inevitable result of their intense\noriginality, they pursued a steady course to the end of their lives.\n\nThe socialistic doctrines which have been read into the work of Millet\nare rather the outcome of the world's uneasy conscience being brought\nface to face with a crushing indictment of existing conditions, than\nof any design on the artist's part to further the cause of a political\npropaganda by means of his art. This somewhat extravagant reading into\nhis art has certainly been carried to excess. Particularly has such\nbeen the case in America, where a large number of his finest works are\nat present to be found, curiously enough in the hands of enormously\nwealthy people, who are frequently perhaps the least able to\nunderstand the real meaning of his message.\n\nComing from a peasant stock, his sympathies were always with the\npeasant; it was the only class he understood or cared for. He lived as\none of them, and shared to a large extent in their labour. He has been\ndesignated, not inappropriately, the philosopher in sabots. Rightly or\nwrongly he has come to be looked upon as one of the high priests of\ncommunistic doctrines. Few pictures have been so anathematised as the\n\"Man with the Hoe,\" and perhaps none have done more to inculcate\nsympathy with the degradation of the lower orders of the human race.\n\nThe revolting brutality and vacancy of that face haunts the\nimagination. Is it possible that fellow-creatures so utterly debased\nby toil and neglect exist? Millet dispels any doubt upon the question\nby bequeathing to humanity this trenchant portrait. By no means\nlimited to Barbizon or France, these poor creatures exist in every\ncountry, and curiously enough are considered an essential element in\neach country's development.\n\nThis poignantly human note is observable in almost every work Millet\nwrought; his passionate sympathy with his fellow-man is the keynote of\nhis art. The wood-cutter in his arduous toil, the shepherd in his\nsolitariness, the labourer turning the soil with unvarying and\nlaborious monotony, the mother caring for her children--all carry the\nsame message for him of that strange and incomprehensible mingling of\njoy and sadness we call life. Like many great minds before and since\nhis time, our artist found the greatest joy in life in a placid and\nnever changing melancholy. But the peasants he chose knew nothing of\nthe sadness he saw in them. Completely inured to their toil, and\nsubdued by it, with no refining or uplifting influence to stimulate\nthem, they knew nothing, aspired to nothing beyond what they were; it\nwas left to Millet to supply the \"might have been.\" He saw the inky\nblackness of the mind of the \"Man with the Hoe,\" the pathetic\ninequality between the mounted farmer directing the safe storage of\nhis crop, and the stooping figures of the \"Gleaners\" eager to scrape\nup the miserable crumbs which had fallen from the rich man's table. He\ntraced the lives of these simple folk until we arrive at the grim and\ngaunt figure of Death, who, as he grasps the woodman by the shoulder,\nreminds him that his course is finished and that he, in common with\nall his fellow-men, must enter the great unknown land from which there\nis no return. It is a sad and melancholy art, vibrating with purity\nand truth, the outpouring of a great soul yearning to express itself\nto the utmost of its power. The mind and character of the man can be\nread in every line and in every touch of the brush. His drawings and\netchings are even more searching in their virility than his pictures.\n\nThere is a spontaneousness about them we search for in vain in his\nwork in oil and pastel. In black and white his intensely emotional\nmind found a swift method of expression; in the laboriousness of oil\npainting he was fettered with the complications of the medium. It can\nbe fairly said that only in one or two paintings--a notable example\ncan be cited in the wondrous \"Sawyers\" at South Kensington--does he\nrise to the height of a great painter. Millet was a poet, a\nphilosopher, a great thinker, and the means he chose for expressing\nhimself were those which were best fitted to his purpose. His\npredilections in art were concentrated upon the greatest, and\nconsequently the men who appealed to him were the thinkers of the\nages. Mantegna and Correggio, Michel Angelo and the mighty Greeks,\nthese were the masters who left their impress upon his mind and art.\n\nThe influence of so sincere and profound an artist has necessarily\nbeen profound. He has moulded men who have achieved world-wide fame;\nSegantini, for example, would never have risen to the heights he did\nhad the example of Millet not been ever before him. There have been\nmany who, without possessing his genius, have endeavoured to follow\nin his footsteps, but successfully as his imitators have sometimes\ncaught his style, their productions can never live alongside his,\nbecause they lack the real ring of sincerity.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n        a. One bed, or folding cot,\n        b. One oil stove,\n        c. One lamp,\n        d. Enough supplies of all kinds sufficient for six months,\n        e. Pots, pans, kettles, etc.\nIt is needless to say that positions in Manila and Iloilo were now at\na premium.\n\nWas it possible that teachers were to be sent to places where even the\nnecessaries of life could not be obtained! Was it possible that many\nwould be sent to places so remote that for six months no fresh\nsupplies could be gotten! A mass meeting was held at once, and a\ncommittee was appointed to send a cablegram to the Associated Press\npetitioning aid from the American people at large. Realizing what\nconsternation would be created throughout the United States by such a\nmessage, two of the teachers leaped into a carriage at the close of\nthe meeting and a few moments later were closeted with the chief\nexecutive of the department. As a result the committee was persuaded\nnot to send the cablegram to the Associated Press until by courtesy it\nhad been sent to the President. Of course, this diplomatic move tided\naffairs over and the teachers who had flatly refused to budge from\nManila now agreed to go on to their stations, being assured that\nwhatever action was best would be taken.\n\nThe day had come when we must separate. We were to enter an untried\nand an unknown field. It was fitting that we have a final joyous\nmeeting, so the best orchestra in the archipelago was engaged and we\n\"chased the hours with flying feet\" until dawn so that whatever might\ncome to us in that unknown future upon which we were entering each\nwould hold in pleasant memory our last evening together.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER III. - A DRAMA IN ACTUAL LIFE.\n\n\nAlmost every one heeded the warning to go to his station forearmed\nwith at least necessaries of life, but, as it had never fallen to the\nlot of the writer to cook, he refused to learn at that late day, so he\ntook no pot, no pan, no kettle, putting his future into the hands of\nan uncertain fate and relying upon the unknown hospitality of the\nFilipino.\n\nBacalod, the capital of the province of Occidental Negros, was our\ndestination. The second morning after leaving Manila, we awoke with\nthe \"Kilpatrick\" lying at anchor in a shallow bay. We were several\nmiles from the shore and nothing in sight indicated that we had\nreached a place of any importance. Late the night before we had been\nawakened by the loud, sharp ringing of the ship's bells, accompanied\nby the reversal of the engines and a general disturbance awaking the\ncrew. So our first impressions on coming on deck were that we had run\naground. But the captain assured us that everything was ship-shape and\nthat this was the nearest point of approach to Capiz, a town of\nconsiderable importance on the island of Panay, where a body of troops\nwas to embark for home. Not even the grass hut of a native was in\nsight. Search as we would, not a sign was seen of a stream flowing\ninto the sea, indicating the probable presence of a town. There was\nnot a sign of life of any kind save one lone column of thin, blue\nsmoke that arose from the side of a mountain miles away. One would\nhave thought that we were explorers of three hundred years ago lying\noff the shore of some unknown land.\n\nAfter breakfast the steam launch, together with all the boats, was\nlowered, and several of us who had determined to miss no opportunity\nto gather information about the islands took our places in the launch\nby the side of the ship's mate, and steamed away across the water with\na long line of boats strung out in the rear. We headed away toward a\ngroup of cocoanut trees, and about an hour later stepped ashore on a\npile of decayed coral rocks that extended some twenty or thirty feet\nout into the water, thus forming the only landing place of a town of\nseveral thousands of people and of considerable commercial importance.\n\nA few moments after we had landed, an army wagon drawn by a\nmagnificent pair of mules came up out of a tropical jungle along a\nnarrow road. We clambered into the wagon and were soon lost in the\ndepths of foliage from which we had just seen the vehicle emerge.\n\nLong waving bamboos with their plumy leafage hung over the road from\neach side, meeting and overlapping in the center until they formed an\narchway so dense that the tropical sun now high in the heavens\npenetrated it only at intervals. At times the wagon sank up to the\nhubs in the soft earth, and the muscles of the mules stood out like\nwhip-cords under the skin as they drew us forward.\n\nAt a sharp turn in the road we came upon the first division of troops\nthat was to embark for home. The look of joy upon their sun-browned\nfaces was inexpressible. Their work was done, and with elastic step\nand smiling faces they saluted us as they passed by. The reign of\nforce was at an end; it was going out with them; the reign of peace\nhad begun; it was coming in with us.\n\nIn the afternoon when we returned from the town the last of the troops\nhad arrived and, as we drove up, the bugle was sounding the call to\nsupper. We noticed native women mingling with the troops and, indeed,\na native woman was in constant attention waiting upon one of the\nsoldiers with whom we ate. Her clothes were clean, her hair was nicely\ncombed, and her general appearance was neat. She seemed to anticipate\nthe slightest wish of the soldier with whom she was. She brought him\nwater to drink, cleaned his plate after the meal and saw that his\nknife, fork, and spoon were put into his haversack.\n\nWe had now finished supper and the launch had returned for the last\nload of troops. The lieutenant in command of the company gave the\norder to \"fall in\"; the men shouldered their rifles and fell into\nline. \"Forward, march!\" called the lieutenant, and the column swept\nforward towards the boats. The women had until now restrained\nthemselves, but, as their husbands marched away never to return, their\nfeelings could no longer be restrained. One young woman of about\neighteen, who was leaning against a rock by the roadside sobbing, when\nher husband passed, leaped up in frenzy of passionate love and caught\nthe rifle from his shoulder. Her first impulse seemed to be to throw\nthe gun away, but suddenly realizing the futility of such an act she\nburst into tears, shouldered the rifle herself and marched on by his\nside. Another woman of more mature age threw her arms around the legs\nof a tall stalwart man, and drew him bodily from the line.\n\nBut the troops marched on and entered the boats. One woman who had\nbeen unnoticed before came down into the shallow water and caught hold\nof our last boat as if to prevent its leaving, while others stood\nmingling their sobs with the sounds of the wavelets as they broke on\nthe sands. As we passed away, an expectant mother, standing in bold\noutline against the twilight sky, threw up her hands in an agony of\ndespair and then sank upon the stones. The curtain had fallen upon a\ndrama in actual life deeper in pathos than any other we had ever seen\nor ever expected to see. Depth of passion, depth of love! Who can\nfathom the human heart?\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. - WHAT THE TEACHERS DID.\n\n\nThere is a remarkable sameness about the towns in the Philippines.\n\nThey all have a large open square about the middle of the town, around\nthree sides of which are Chinese stores, unless one side lies open to\nthe sea, and on the fourth is the great stone ecclesia. The streets\nrun at right angles to one another and divide up the town into\ncreditable squares.\n\nEverybody in the Philippines lives up-stairs, for the ground is so\nsoaked with water during the rainy season that it is a menace to\nhealth to live upon the ground floor. So even the poorest nippa hut\nis built upon stakes four or five feet above the ground.\n\nBacalod is a typical Philippine town. As we landed, a broad open\nsquare was spread out before us. Two sides of the square were lined\nwith two-story houses in which were Chinese stores below and Filipino\nhomes above. On the third side stood the great stone church in whose\nmassive tower the clock was striking the hour of four, while the\nfourth lay open to the sea that had borne us thither.\n\nWe landed, but it was in a method new to us and one not usually\nemployed by the traveling public.\n\nWhen our sail boat ran aground on the sandy bottom a hundred yards or\nmore from the shore, a crowd of Filipino men who were on the beach\nslowly rolled up their pantaloons and waded out to the rescue,--for\nthe money that was in it. The boat's crew elevated their trousers'\nlegs also and slided down into the water. Each of us then straddled\nthe neck of a Filipino standing in the water and was held by ankles to\nbe steadied while our biped mounts proceeded to the shore.\n\nWe were now on the ground and face to face with the situation. To give\nthe reader an idea of the actual conditions met by the first teachers\nwho went to the Islands, the following is copied from the instructions\ngiven us in Manila:\n    1. There shall be two sessions daily of all schools, and the\n    last hour of the morning session shall be devoted solely to\n    instructing the Filipino teachers.\n\n    2. In cases where teachers are sent to a town in which there\n    is no school-house, they are expected to secure the aid of the\n    people and have one built.\n\n    3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is\n    stopped.\n\n    4. All supplies must be kept under lock and key. In towns\n    where there is no case or box to lock the supplies in, and it\n    is also impossible to get the town council to furnish a case,\n    a requisition may be sent to Manila, and, if an appropriation\n    can be secured, one will be made and sent out.\n\nThus it can be easily seen that we were indeed pioneers. In many\nplaces no school-house was to be found, and in some cases it was even\ndifficult to get the town council to provide a case in which to keep\nthe supplies.\n\nThe work of the teachers was, in short; to \"make the English language\nthe basis of instruction in the public schools.\" On our arrival at\nBacalod two schools were found in progress, for some soldiers had been\ndetailed for the work here previous to our coming. One of these was\nfor boys and the other, for girls. Thus the work here had been in a\nmeasure simplified, but complications that had arisen at Talisay, one\nof the largest and richest towns on the island, demanded a change of\nteachers and the writer was assigned to the place as superintendent.\n\nHere an attempt had been made to start a school but it had failed\nignominiously and a system of education was to be put into operation\nfrom the very start.\n\nThe Filipinos are not strong advocates of co-education, so separate\nschools were to be started for the boys and the girls. The one for the\nboys was gotten well in hand before the one for the girls was\nattempted at all.\n\nA few days after reaching the town and securing a home the\npresidente of the town had it publicly announced that the following\nMonday morning at eight o'clock a public school for boys would be\nopened in a building that had been rented for the purpose by the\nmunicipal council. About the middle of the afternoon of the same day a\nman beat a little drum throughout all the streets of the town to call\nthe people out and the town clerk announced both in Spanish and in the\nnative language that this public school would begin at the time and\nplace mentioned above; that instruction would be free to all who came;\nthat the government would furnish all supplies; and that instruction\nwould be given in the English language. A native principal and\nassistants were employed and everything was ready to begin.\n\nThe official report of the result is as follows:\n    Boys' public school of Talisay, Negros, P. I., began November\n    4, 1901. Forty-three boys present at eight o'clock. Forty-one\n    of them knew \"good morning\" and \"good afternoon\" but do not\n    know the distinction between them. Two of them speak simple\n    Spanish. At eight forty-five, eight more, who had been\n    attending an early morning private school, came in together.\n\n    The books they brought were so varied and so different from\n    one another that it seemed impossible to bring any reasonable\n    degree of order out of such a chaos, and so, after struggling\n    vainly for about a week with the problem, the superintendent\n    by one fell stroke removed everything in use and put in a\n    uniform system, and from that day on the English language has\n    been the basis of instruction in the public schools of\n    Talisay. The work was of necessity very slow at first, but by\n    the end of a year two schools were going nicely and a number\n    of the brightest boys and girls had made really excellent\n    progress.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER V. - A \"BAILE.\"\n\n\nNot long after the arrival of our party at Bacalod we received an\ninvitation to a \"baile\" given in our honor by the inhabitants of\nSilay, a town some ten or twelve miles up the northern coast and one\nnoted for its social life. The invitation was accepted with pleasure,\nand about the middle of the afternoon on the day appointed we were\nclad in the immaculate white of the tropics and steaming away up the\ncoast on board a launch sent for our conveyance. Twilight was still\nlingering on the path of day when we anchored just off shore at the\ntown. A row-boat containing the officials of the city came out to meet\nus and, in due season, we were ushered into a spacious drawing-room\nfilled almost to overflowing with the \u00e9lite of the town. The \u00e9lite of\ntowns in the Philippines speak Spanish, and, as only one or two of our\nparty could at that time boast of more than a formal acquaintance with\nthe Castilian tongue, the exchange of ideas that evening between us\nand the Filipinos was of necessity not very rapid.\n\nThe necessity of easy communication between us was rendered somewhat\nless indispensable by the announcement of supper as soon as we were\nrested from our trip. When we had taken our places at the table a\nyoung Filipino about twenty-five years of age arose and gave a lengthy\ntoast to the recent union of the Philippines with the United States.\n\nBut as we Americans were unable to scale the dizzy heights of his\nclimaxes or sink to the depths of his pathos, we forewent the\npleasures of his oratory and turned our attention to the savory odor\nof lamb, chicken, and roast pig that came slyly stealing up our\nnostrils to send us nerve dispatches about the gastronomic delights of\nour not far distant future.\n\nAt last the toast was ended and the world-wide soup ushered in a long\ntrain of things good to eat, served in a style better fitted to the\ndelights of the appetite than to the formalities of dinners, for, as\nsoon as the pleasant task of one dish was completed by any one, the\nnext was served him at once regardless of the progress made by the\nothers at the table.\n\nThe last course was dulce. The new-comers to the Philippines will\nnot be long in making the acquaintance of this dish, and at all\nmeetings, both public and private, where eatables are served, it\nperforms an important part. It is anything sweet, and it may vary all\nthe way from an india-rubber-like black mixture of cocoanut milk and\ndirty sugar to a really toothsome and respectable confection. No\nmatter of what materials a dish is composed, just so long as it is\nsweet, it is dulce.\n\nAfter paying our respects to this last course, we arose from the table\nand entered a great rectangular room from the center of whose ceiling\nhung a large glass chandelier, a mass of shimmering crystals. In the\nchairs around the room were the wealth, the youth, and the beauty of\nthe town.\n\nThe first and also the last number of every Filipino dance of any\nformality is the \"rigodon.\" The dancers are arranged in a square, or\nquadrangle according to the number participating, and are then led\nthrough a tangled maze of figures that so utterly bewilders the novice\nthat he sinks into his chair at the end of the dance wondering how it\nall came to pass.\n\nWe Americans breathed a sigh of relief when the \"rigodon\" ended, and\nmustered fresh courage for social conquests in the waltz that was now\nbreathing forth from the trembling strings. My companion in the first\ndance had been the young lady by whose side I had sat at dinner. But\nit now became necessary to search for another, so I prudently waited\nto see how partners were chosen, and made no mistake when a few\nmoments later I faced one of the most luscious looking se\u00f1oritas on\nthe opposite side of the room and offered her my arm. My eyes must\nhave told the story that my lips could not utter in Spanish, for she\nsmiled upon me sweetly, arose, and put her hand upon my shoulder. My\narm encircled her waist and I began to waltz. Unfortunately my\ncompanion did not follow, but began to hop up and down in a manner\nmost distressing. Supposing the attack to be only temporary, I paused\nand, much to my relief, she soon showed signs of recovery; and in the\ncourse of time she came to a standstill looking up into my face in an\ninquiring sort of way, apparently wondering why St. Vitus had not paid\nhis respects to me also. A second attempt to follow the music met with\nresults similar to the first, and during the third attempt, which\nseemed to be trembling on the verge of a failure, St. Vitus let go my\ncompanion and seized me with such vigor that she, who was small even\nfor a Filipino, was gathered up bodily and taken around the room at\nsuch a pace that her toes touched the floor only at far distant\nintervals.\n\nAt this point my devotion to the shrine of Terpsichore ceased from\nforce of circumstances and I seated myself in one of the most\ncomfortable chairs in sight that I might carry out a previously formed\nplan to study the Filipino somewhat critically as he appears in\nsociety.\n\nThe first thing that impressed me as the dancers passed up and down\nthe room was the flash of diamonds. Nearly every woman in the room had\non a brooch that flashed the colors of the rainbow at every turn.\n\nAlmost all of them wore one or more rings that showed up brilliantly\nunder the chandelier. Many of the men too, especially the young men,\nwore gems that appeared to be exquisite. A closer inspection showed\nthat some of the gems had flaws and others were of a poor color, but\nno one would have denied that, taken as a whole, it was a really\nbeautiful display.\n\nThe dress of the ladies was richly colored. Many of their skirts were\nof silk covered with hand embroidered flowers, and their filmy pina\nwaists and broad collar pieces were rich with needle-work. They all\nwore a kind of heelless velvet slipper, very common as a dress shoe in\nthe Philippines, or high-heeled patent leather shoes with neatly\nfitting black stockings.\n\nThe men were dressed in white coats and white pantaloons or black\ncoats and white pantaloons. White shirts and collars, together with\nall sorts and styles of cravats and low-cut patent leather shoes with\nhighly colored socks completed their dress.\n\nIt was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money;\nthat they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a\ntable loaded with good things was a fact to which all of us were\nenthusiastic witnesses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VI. - A SKETCH OF LIFE IN THE PHILIPPINES.\n\n\nHouse-keeping in the Philippines presents some interesting phases. Our\nclub of American officials decided to run a mess, so we employed a\ncook and a house boy, then each of us provided himself with a personal\nservant, making a total of six servants for four men--it takes about\nthis proportion of servants to live in any sort of comfort in the\nPhilippines--and launched ourselves boldly upon the sea of domestic\neconomy. But there were shoals ahead of us, for the question of\nregulating servants is one of no small importance in the Philippines,\nand one of its most disadvantageous features is the long chain of\ndependents that usually attends it.\n\nWe gave the cooks so much a day with which to buy supplies in the\nlocal market, for our own table, making him render a daily list of\nexpenditures, and a fixed amount besides to purchase rice and fish for\nhimself and the other servants. Of course, if they wished to vary\ntheir diet and get chicken and fresh pork, which could be had at far\ndistant intervals, it was wholly a matter of their option, but the\nallowance was made on the basis of so much rice and fish a day for\neach. This allowance was about fifteen cents a day in Spanish coin per\nservant.\n\nThus far all was well. We had agreed to give the cook eight dollars a\nmonth in Spanish money, thinking that good wages would procure good\nservice, but the visions of affluence that floated before him on such\nfloods of wealth were so alluring that they drew him from the kitchen\nto the cooler veranda. In less than a week he had employed an\nassistant at four dollars a month; in less than another week that\nassistant had employed him an assistant at two dollars a month; in\nless than another week that assistant to the assistant had employed\nhim an assistant at the princely salary of fifty cents a month; and\nfrom fear that the chain of dependents would end only by our having\nthe whole Filipino race attached to our culinary force, we broke up\nhouse-keeping and went boarding again, choosing that as the less of\nthe two evils.\n\nOur house furnishings were almost wholly Philippine. The table ware\nand the food on the table came from the ends of the earth. The knives\nand forks were made in Germany, the plates were manufactured in\nEngland, the glass ware and table cloth, in the United States. The\noatmeal and flour came from the United States also. The butter came\nfrom Australia, the rice from China, the salt from Russia, and the\nother eatables from sources about as various as their separate names.\n\nSwitzerland furnished the condensed milk and Illinois the canned\ncream. Nearly all of the canned fruit bore labels from Spain.\n\nThus it can easily be seen that life in the Philippines, if lived\naccording to American ideals, is dependent upon a highly developed and\nhighly complex commerce. However, the difficulties of transportation\nand the restriction of large stocks of merchandise to Manila and some\nhalf a dozen other towns, make so great a difference between country\nlife and city life that a short comparison of the two will not be out\nof place, and life in Manila may well be taken as being fairly typical\nof the latter.\n\nLife in Manila is pleasant, but expensive. It is pleasant from the\nfact that it is not only the capital but also metropolis of the\narchipelago. Thus the combination of wealth and high official position\nhas given to Manila a society of the highest and most refined type.\n\nThe process of beautifying and improving the city which is constantly\ngoing on bids fair to give us at no distant day a city of which we may\nwell be proud.\n\nBut let him who intends living well in Manila on a small income bid\nfarewell at once to so idylic a dream, for it costs much to live well\nthere. In the city of Manila one can get almost anything he wishes,\nbut it must be paid for at the price it commands. Especially in the\ncase of eatables, this price is by no means small, because to the\nfirst cost of articles must in most cases be added the expense of\ndistant shipment from American, European, or Australian ports, and not\ninfrequently the cost of long refrigeration must also be taken into\nconsideration. But, expensive though it is, it is very pleasant to\nlive there and those who have once enjoyed it often wish again to\nquaff the cup of its delights.\n\nIn strong contrast to this pleasant life is the life of the quiet\nlittle hamlet away in the distant islands. Indeed, the Filipino from\nthe distant town, who by some good fortune has been to Manila, or, by\na coup de main, has studied in one of the Manila colleges, is looked\nup to in a true hero-worshiping attitude by all who either know him or\nhear of his fame. Life in such a place is one long state of harmless\ninactivity. Not a wave of trouble from the great outer world ever\ndisturbs its peaceful repose. One lounges forever in an air of\nindolent ease and extreme aversion to anything approaching what might\nbe called a respectable effort.\n\nOne arises in the morning about the time the sun's first rays silver\nthe top leaves of the cocoanut trees and then stirs around until nine\nor ten o'clock, when it is found expedient to avoid a further exposure\nto the sun. From then until about five o'clock in the afternoon it is\nbest to take things as they come, even though one of those things be a\nFilipino dinner. But then you may have your vehiclo attached to a\nyoung bull with a ring in his nose and go for a drive. If it is the\ndry season you will probably enjoy the drive unless you object to the\nfrequent clouds of dust swept along by the evening wind. If it is in\nthe rainy season your pleasure will depend to a considerable extent\nupon how wet you get; but, whether the season be wet or dry, your\npleasure will be regulated largely by the state of harmony existing\nbetween the driver and the bull.\n\nIn these quiet secluded nooks successive generations of Filipinos are\nborn, reared, grow old and die in an even chain of events broken only\nby the occasional erection of a new grass house on the identical spot\nwhere its predecessors have stood for ages. The son lives in the house\nof his father, cultivates the same few square feet of soil planted in\nedible roots, climbs the same cocoanut trees, follows the same winding\npath down to the stream, pounds rice in the same mortar and with the\nsame stick that his ancestors have used from time unremembered, and,\nin case of illness, curls up on a grass mat in a corner of the room\nuntil he dies or by some good fortune recovers. Beyond this narrow\nhorizon he never looks. So narrow and contracted is the life that the\nlanguages of two towns a few miles apart are so different that one\nwould scarcely recognize them as belonging to the same race of people.\n\nSuch are the two extremes of life in our new far Eastern provinces:\nthe one is active, progressive, and cosmopolitan; the other, inactive,\ndecadent, and narrow; but, whether one enjoys the first or endures the\nsecond, there comes to him after leaving a longing to lounge again in\ntropic airs and listen to the lullaby of the winds among the palms.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VII. - THE FILIPINO AT HOME.\n\n\nAs one enters a Filipino sitting-room for the first time, there is one\nfeature in the arrangement of the furniture that impresses itself upon\nhim at once, and it may be stated without fear of serious\ncontradiction that this same peculiar feature in its arrangement will\ncontinue to face him, as he enters different homes, about as certainly\nas he crosses the threshold.\n\nThe arrangement referred to is that of one large mirror, one settee,\nand some ten or a dozen chairs that appear to have had a certain\norderly affection for one another. The mirror is hung upon one of the\nlarge interior parts of the house about four feet above the floor. The\nwooden houses in the Philippines are built by setting large posts\nupright into the ground, extending into the air from twenty to thirty\nfeet. Cross timbers are fastened to these upright posts about eight or\nten feet above the ground and then not sawed off even with the posts,\nbut allowed to extend beyond them each way. The framework of the house\nis built upon these extending cross timbers, a style of building by\nwhich these large upright posts are left standing out on the inside of\nthe room from one to three feet from the walls. It is on that one of\nthese posts most nearly opposite the door that the mirror always finds\nits place. Immediately beneath the mirror is the settee; and the\nchairs are arranged in two parallel lines facing one another and at\nright angles with the ends of the settee. However odd this arrangement\nmay appear to one when he first enters a Filipino drawing-room, there\nare two things to be said in its favor. In the first place, it places\nyou face to face with the person with whom you are conversing so that\nyou can watch him,--a matter of no small moment in the Philippines. In\nthe next place, it enables you to give one of the young ladies a\nsheep's-eye in the mirror while the others present are left where\nMoses was in our much abused conundrum.\n\nThe size of the residence and the quality of its furnishings depends\nupon the wealth of the owner. But there is so vast a difference\nbetween the mode of life of the highest class and the tao, or lowest\nclass, that it is well to speak of them separately, and the great\nmiddle class of Filipinos can easily be imagined to occupy the\nintervening ground.\n\nThe rich Filipino's house is usually of wood built upon a wall of\nstone or brick from ten to fifteen feet high. The floors are kept\nhighly polished in his hallway, dressing-room, and bed-rooms. There\nare, of course, no fire-places in any of the rooms, but on some\noccasions something is needed to dry the rain-soaked atmosphere, for\neven in the dry season it has been seen to rain for five successive\ndays and nights without the cessation of a moment.\n\nA long chain of dependents is attached to the household of the rich\nFilipino. The master has his special body servant to be present at all\ntimes to do his master's bidding, in short, to be the visible\nmechanism of his master's volition. So, too, the lady of the house has\nher servant woman to do the slightest bidding of her ladyship. Then\nthere is the cook who is almost invariably a man, a house boy or two,\nand the coachman. These functionaries, with their assistants and\nassistants to the assistants, together with a servant or two for the\nexclusive service of the children, complete the economic household.\n\nSuch a family has an abundance of rice and wheat bread, also of\nchicken and fish with occasional fresh beef. They have also a good\ndeal of dulce. They regularly serve wine and frequently serve beer\non their tables.\n\nIn strong contrast with this mode of life is that of the tao. His\ndiet consists almost wholly of rice and small uncleaned fish boiled\ntogether. As a rule knife, fork, plate, and spoon find no place in his\nhousehold. The rice and fish are boiled in a pot and then allowed to\ncool in the same vessel or poured out to cool in a large earthen or\nwooden bowl. Then Mr. Tao together with Mrs. Tao and all the young\nTaos squat on their heels around the mixture and satisfy that\nintangible thing called the appetite. They do not use chop sticks as\nthe Chinese do, but the rice and fish are caught in a hollow formed by\nthe first three fingers of the right hand. The thumb is then placed\nbehind the mass. It is raised up and poised before the mouth, with a\nskill coming from the evolution of ages, when a contraction of the\nmuscles of the thumb throws the mass into the mouth with a skill that\nis marvelous to any but a Filipino. To judge from the most reliable\ninformation, the poorest class do not have an abundance of food,\nalthough it would seem that such a condition of things would be\nwell-nigh impossible. However, in a census of one hundred school\nchildren there were found six boys and four girls who declared that\nthey had never had enough to eat, and the native teacher stated that\nthis was probably true.\n\nThe wide gulf between the tao and the rich man is filled by the\ngreat middle class of Filipinos.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VIII. - VISIT TO A LEPER COLONY.\n\n\nNot far from our town was a leper colony and the first Saturday that\ncould be spared was set aside for a trip to the place. It happened\nthat none of the other Americans were at leisure on this particular\nmorning, but, rather then delay the trip or miss it altogether, the\nwriter, armed with a revolver, started out alone.\n\nThe road had been described so accurately by one who was supposed to\nknow it that it was deemed well-nigh impossible to miss the way. The\nmain highway was followed to the point where the by-path supposed to\nlead to the settlement turned off through some bamboo thickets and a\nlow tropical wood. This path led straight away towards the sea-coast\nwhere the houses of the colony were said to stand in a cocoanut grove\nby the beach.\n\nUpon arriving at the settlement, a very inhospitable reception was\nreceived from a mangy cur that growled and showed a very uninviting\nset of sharp, white teeth behind his snarling lips. The growling of\nthe dog had attracted the attention of an old man who, with age-bent\nback, was pounding rice in a mortar about fifty yards away. He turned\nslowly around and, upon seeing an intruder into the primitive quiet of\nthe place, gave a sharp, far-reaching call. The sound had scarcely\nrung through the grove when from about a dozen of the little grass\nhouses dotted here and there fifteen or twenty men armed with bolos\ncame out and gathered around the old man. A sense of my danger flashed\nupon me. Three miles from town and alone in a tropical jungle, I could\nbe almost instantly overcome by this band of bolo-men, and the only\nreport that would ever reach my people would be that I had\n\"disappeared.\" Of course, attack was by no means certain, but the\npotentiality of the situation was thrilling. A drawn revolver and the\ngleaming of its shining barrel had the effect of stopping the men, who\nseemed to be hesitating as to a course of action, until a somewhat\ndignified retreat was made to an open space in the rear from where a\nless dignified and a more hasty retreat began which did not stop short\nof Bacalod.\n\nEnough had been seen, however, even in this short visit, to give\nconvincing proof that the settlement visited was no colony of lepers;\nso, that afternoon two servant boys being taken as guides and\ninterpreters, another attempt was made to reach the goal desired.\n\nThis attempt was successful, and, after about two hours of walking, a\nlittle cluster of grass huts snugly hidden by the sea-coast came into\nview. As we approached, one would have thought it a gala-day. Some few\nchildren, apparently from six to thirteen years of age, almost wholly\nnude, were romping and playing in the open space around which the huts\nstood, and no one would ever have thought that any cloud so horrible\nas leprosy could hover over a place apparently so happy.\n\nBy the side of the path as we passed was a man and his wife setting\nout potato plants. His hands were so puffed and his fingers so short\nthat he could scarcely use them, but he was working along as best he\ncould. His wife's feet were so swollen and twisted that she walked\nonly with the greatest difficulty. We passed them by and entered the\nopen space above referred to.\n\nThe children now saw us, and those of them who could darted away like\nfrightened rabbits, each to his own burrow. An old man who was sitting\nin the warm afternoon sun on the little bamboo platform before his hut\nwas aroused from his lethargic repose by the scampering away of the\nchildren. He arose, trembling upon his tottering limbs, all drawn and\ntwisted, and hobbled away into his hut.\n\nThe children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at\nthe doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of\nthe settlement. In a few moments we were surrounded by a circle of\nhuman beings at once so repulsive and so pitiable that its graphic\nvividness can never be accurately portrayed.\n\nThe old man referred to above, having put on a pair of snow-white\npantaloons, appeared now at the doorway of his hut, followed a few\nmoments later by his wife who had evidently clothed herself in the\nbest raiment she had. At a call from the old man, all the men, women,\nand children in the settlement came out of their huts and stood in a\nline before us. The old man was spokesman and in his native visayan\ntongue made a heart-rending appeal for aid which we were powerless to\ngive. Attention was called to a leper woman, apparently about\ntwenty-five years of age, whose face had been attacked by the disease\nand whose appearance was truly pathetic. Upon her hip was a child\nabout a year and a half old and, strange to say, the child showed as\nyet no signs whatever of the disease.\n\nWhat an indissoluble enigma is life! Here in a little cluster of grass\nhuts in a secluded nook of a secluded island of an all but secluded\narchipelago was gathered together a little community of wretched\nnatives, driven by their loathsomeness from association with others\neven of the same half-savage race. Yet here, men and women loved and\nwere married, by mutual trust if not by law, and children were born of\nthe union to live forever under the unspeakable horror that\novershadowed the unfortunate parents. Love, hatred, sorrow, and\njoy--every passion that enters into the complex structure of the human\nheart even here, in this scene of sadness and despair, was playing\napparently as freely as where misfortune and disease had never crossed\nthe portals of life.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER IX. - A \"HIKE.\"\n\n\nWe were lounging lazily in our hammocks at Jimamaylan one evening in\nApril. Supper was just ended, and the soldiers in the post were\ncollected in groups here and there spinning yarns to pass away the\ntime, when a Filipino clad only in a loin cloth came down the street\nat a steadily swinging run and stopped in front of the sentry. He\nbrought the announcement that a band of ladrones had just burned a\nsugar mill and were advancing to sack a barrio about fifteen miles\naway.\n\nThe invitation of the commanding officer to go on a \"hike\" was eagerly\naccepted, and, in ten minutes after the message was given, the troops\nwere on the march followed by two adventurous pedagogues.\n\nDarkness was just closing in as we left the town, but a resplendent\ntropic moon soon made the night almost as brilliant as the day. The\ntrail we followed led over rough and rocky country. Sometimes for a\ndistance of a mile or more we passed over barren wastes of volcanic\nslag poured out in anger by some peak whose convulsions have long\nsince ceased. Again we would descend into a tropical jungle from the\ndense foliage of which the ladrones could have leaped at any moment,\nhad they known of our coming, and annihilated our little band. We\nforded rapid streams with the water at our breasts, and halted only\nonce in that rapid march of fifteen miles.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the town we met a man who was standing\nguard against a surprise by the ladrones. Nothing could well have been\nmuch more grotesque and nothing could much better illustrate the\nabsolutely primitive condition of the Filipinos in the interior of the\nislands than the appearance of this guard. A pair of knee pants, a\nconical grass hat, and a hemp shirt formed his entire apparel. A long\nflat wooden shield, a bolo, and a long bamboo spear with a sharp,\nflat, iron point, completed his equipment for battle.\n\nHere stood the first and the twentieth centuries side by side. The\nFilipino who had advanced only a stage beyond the condition of\nprimitive man with his knife, spear, and wooden shield, stood side by\nside with the American soldier, a representative of modern life with\nhis magazine rifle, his canteen, his knapsack,--with every article of\nhis clothing made to give him the highest possible efficiency as the\nunit of a military organization.\n\nA few yards farther on we met another guard equipped similarly to the\nfirst. Upon reaching the town, news had just been received that a\ndetachment of troops from another post had intercepted the ladrones\nand fought a skirmish with them. The ladrones had escaped and we set\nout in pursuit of them on a chase wilder than a Quixotic dream. We\nwound our way into the mountains behind the town, inquiring at every\ngrass hut we passed whether the band of ladrones had passed that way,\nbut only once was even a trace of them found. Then it was learned that\nat a certain place they had separated into groups of three or four and\ngone glimmering through the dream of things that were. This place was\nin a secluded nook of the mountains where in years gone by some\nadventurous Spaniard had erected a primitive water mill to grind his\nsugar-cane. We had now marched about twenty miles and the feet of the\npedagogues were a mass of blisters. They had reached the point where\nthat form of military maneuvering called \"hiking\" ceased to possess\nany alluring charms. So a native was persuaded to come out of his lone\nmountain hut and hitch up his carabao and cart. He was then made to\nget on the carabao's back, while the aforesaid pedagogues lay down on\nthe sugar-cane pulp that had been put into the body of the cart, and\nthe driver was instructed to start for the post we had left hours\nbefore, and not to stop until he got there. Being uncertain but that\nsome of the ladrones would learn of our having left the body of troops\nand would try the metal of our steel, we at first agreed that neither\nof us should go to sleep, but it was later decided that probably the\ndriver had no greater desire to cross the Styx than his passengers had\nand that in case of danger he would awaken us, so both took a revolver\nin each hand, stretched out supinely and went to sleep.\n\nSuch a sleep! The rough jolting of the cart over an almost impassable\nroad was never enough to break the spell of slumber. When we awoke the\nblazing tropic sun was past the midday mark of morning, shining full\ninto our unprotected and well-nigh blistered faces.\n\nA pack of dogs were heralding our approach to a little village at the\nfoot of the mountains where ponies were procured to take us back to\nthe post."

                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently\nno time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth dimension of Space\nas a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house\nbecame quite quiet.\n\nOn reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up\nagainst a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realize\nhis position. Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\nhundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the\nDowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone\ninto hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains on\none of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who\nhad been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr\nto nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair\nby the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six\nweeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become\nreconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that\nnotorious sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible\nnight when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his\ndressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and\nconfessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox\nout of \u00a350,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card, and swore that\nthe ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back\nto him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because\nhe had seen a green hand tapping at the window-pane, to the beautiful\nLady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round\nher throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin,\nand who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of the\nKing's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he went\nover his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as\nhe recalled to mind his last appearance as \"Red Reuben, or the Strangled\nBabe,\" his d\u00e9but as \"Guant Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,\"\n\nand the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely\nplaying ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And\nafter all this some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him\nthe Rising Sun Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite\nunbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever been treated in this\nmanner. Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance, and remained till\ndaylight in an attitude of deep thought.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III\n\n\nThe next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed\nthe ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. \"I have\nno wish,\" he said, \"to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say\nthat, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,\"--a very just remark,\nat which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.\n\n\"Upon the other hand,\" he continued, \"if he really declines to use the\nRising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him. It\nwould be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside\nthe bedrooms.\"\n\nFor the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the\nblood-stain on the library floor. This certainly was very strange, as\nthe door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept\nclosely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a\ngood deal of comment. Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red,\nthen it would be vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came\ndown for family prayers, according to the simple rites of the Free\nAmerican Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright\nemerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party\nvery much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening. The\nonly person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia, who,\nfor some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the\nsight of the blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was\nemerald-green.\n\nThe second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in\nthe hall. Rushing down-stairs, they found that a large suit of old\narmour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone\nfloor, while seated in a high-backed chair was the Canterville ghost,\nrubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face. The\ntwins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged\ntwo pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained\nby long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United\nStates Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in\naccordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost\nstarted up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a\nmist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so\nleaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase\nhe recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of\ndemoniac laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely\nuseful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single\nnight, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French\ngovernesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly\nlaughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and\nrang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door\nopened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown. \"I am\nafraid you are far from well,\" she said, \"and have brought you a bottle\nof Doctor Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a\nmost excellent remedy.\" The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at\nonce to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an\naccomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family\ndoctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's\nuncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps,\nhowever, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself\nwith becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep\nchurchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.\n\nOn reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the\nmost violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross\nmaterialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what\nreally distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit\nof mail. He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by\nthe sight of a Spectre in armour, if for no more sensible reason, at\nleast out of respect for their natural poet Longfellow, over whose\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\nhour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides it was his own suit.\n\nHe had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament, and had\nbeen highly complimented on it by no less a person than the Virgin Queen\nherself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely overpowered\nby the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen\nheavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees severely, and\nbruising the knuckles of his right hand.\n\nFor some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of\nhis room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.\n\nHowever, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to\nmake a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his\nfamily. He selected Friday, August 17th, for his appearance, and spent\nmost of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in\nfavour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet\nfrilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards evening a\nviolent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was\njust such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to\nmake his way quietly to Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the\nfoot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\nof low music. He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville\nblood-stain by means of Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent. Having reduced\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and\nhis wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead,\nwhile he hissed into her trembling husband's ear the awful secrets of\nthe charnel-house. With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made\nup his mind. She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and\ngentle. A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more\nthan sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the\ncounterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins, he was quite\ndetermined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be done was, of\ncourse, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling\nsensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each\nother, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse,\ntill they became paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw off the\nwinding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white, bleached bones and\none rolling eyeball, in the character of \"Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's\nSkeleton,\" a r\u00f4le in which he had on more than one occasion produced a\ngreat effect, and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of\n\"Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.\"\n\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the\nlight-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves\nbefore they retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still,\nand, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the\nwindow-panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family\nslept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\ncould hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States. He\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his\nmurdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like\nan evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.\n\nOnce he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only\nthe baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange\nsixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\nin the midnight air. Finally he reached the corner of the passage that\nled to luckless Washington's room. For a moment he paused there, the\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's\nshroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was\ncome. He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had\nhe done so than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid\nhis blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was\nstanding a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous\nas a madman's dream! Its head was bald and burnished; its face round,\nand fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\nfeatures into an eternal grin. From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\nlight, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like\nto his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form. On its breast\nwas a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of\nshame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime,\nand, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\n\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's\njack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler. Once in the\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small\npallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes. After a time, however,\nthe brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to\ngo and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight. Accordingly,\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling\nthat, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid\nof his new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins. On reaching\nthe spot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had\nevidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from\nits hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it\nwas leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable\nattitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his\nhorror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a\nrecumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity\nbed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow\nturnip lying at his feet! Unable to understand this curious\ntransformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there,\nin the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:--\n        +------------------------------------+\n        |         YE OTIS GHOSTE             |\n        | Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook, |\n        |    Beware of Ye Imitationes.       |\n        |   All others are counterfeite.     |\n        +------------------------------------+\nThe whole thing flashed across him. He had been tricked, foiled, and\nout-witted! The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his\ntoothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his\nhead, swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\nschool, that, when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds\nof blood would be wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.\n\nHardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of\na distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh,\nand waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\nreason, did not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back\nto his room, thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose. There he\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was\nexceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which this oath\nhad been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second time. \"Perdition\nseize the naughty fowl,\" he muttered, \"I have seen the day when, with my\nstout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow\nfor me an 'twere in death!\" He then retired to a comfortable lead\ncoffin, and stayed there till evening.\n\n\nCHAPTER: IV\n\n\nThe next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were\ncompletely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five\ndays he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point\nof the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want\nit, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a\nlow, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating\nthe symbolic value of sensuous phenomena. The question of phantasmic\napparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a\ndifferent matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large\noriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every month, and he\ndid not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is\nquite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand,\nhe was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.\n\nFor the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as\nusual between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible\nprecaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots,\ntrod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large\nblack velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for\noiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good\ndeal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of\nprotection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he\nslipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a\nlittle humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see\nthat there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a\ncertain degree, it served his purpose. Still in spite of everything he\nwas not left unmolested. Strings were continually being stretched across\nthe corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion,\nwhile dressed for the part of \"Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley\nWoods,\" he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide,\nwhich the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry\nChamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged\nhim, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and\nsocial position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the\nnext night in his celebrated character of \"Reckless Rupert, or the\nHeadless Earl.\"\n\nHe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in\nfact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means\nof it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord\nCanterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome\nJack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\ndown the terrace at twilight. Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\nLord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken\nheart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it\nhad been a great success. It was, however an extremely difficult\n\"make-up,\" if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more\nscientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three\nhours to make his preparations. At last everything was ready, and he was\nvery pleased with his appearance. The big leather riding-boots that went\nwith the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\nfind one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite\nsatisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting\nand crept down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins,\nwhich I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of\nthe colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make\nan effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water\nfell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his\nleft shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed. The shock to his\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\ncould go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold. The only\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\nhad not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences\nmight have been very serious.\n\nHe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,\nand contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in\nlist slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\ndraughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the\ntwins. The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September. He\nhad gone down-stairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that\nthere, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing\nhimself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of\nthe United States Minister and his wife which had now taken the place of\nthe Canterville family pictures. He was simply but neatly clad in a long\nshroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip\nof yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In\nfact, he was dressed for the character of \"Jonas the Graveless, or the\nCorpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,\" one of his most remarkable\nimpersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to\nremember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their\nneighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a quarter-past two o'clock in\nthe morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring. As\nhe was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any\ntraces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a\ndark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads,\nand shrieked out \"BOO!\" in his ear.\n\nSeized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural,\nhe rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him\nthere with the big garden-syringe, and being thus hemmed in by his\nenemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the\ngreat iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to\nmake his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own\nroom in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.\n\nAfter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins\nlay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\nservants, but it was of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings\nwere so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed\nhis great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had\nbeen engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized a wonderful\nclam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse\neuchre, poker, and other American national games, and Virginia rode\nabout the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire,\nwho had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville\nChase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in\nfact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who,\nin reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best\ncongratulations to the Minister's worthy wife.\n\nThe Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the\nhouse, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let\nmatters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the\nyoung Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had\nonce bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice\nwith the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the\nfloor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state that, though\nhe lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but\n\"Double Sixes.\" The story was well known at the time, though, of course,\nout of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt\nwas made to hush it up, and a full account of all the circumstances\nconnected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle's\nRecollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends. The ghost, then,\nwas naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence\nover the Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his\nown first cousin having been married en secondes noces to the Sieur de\nBulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are\nlineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to\nVirginia's little lover in his celebrated impersonation of \"The Vampire\nMonk, or the Bloodless Benedictine,\" a performance so horrible that when\nold Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in\nthe year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which\nculminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after\ndisinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and\nleaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment,\nhowever, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the\nlittle Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal\nBedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.\n\n\nCHAPTER: V\n\n\nA few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out\nriding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting\nthrough a hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go\nup by the back staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past\nthe Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied\nshe saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother's maid, who\nsometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend\nher habit. To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville\nGhost himself! He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of\nthe yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing\nmadly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his hand, and his\nwhole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so forlorn, and so\nmuch out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea\nhad been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity,\nand determined to try and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so\ndeep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she\nspoke to him.\n\n\"I am so sorry for you,\" she said, \"but my brothers are going back to\nEton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy\nyou.\"\n\n\"It is absurd asking me to behave myself,\" he answered, looking round in\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,\n\"quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and\nwalk about at night, if that is what you mean. It is my only reason for\nexisting.\"\n\n\"It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very\nwicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had\nkilled your wife.\"\n\n\"Well, I quite admit it,\" said the Ghost, petulantly, \"but it was a\npurely family matter, and concerned no one else.\"\n\n\"It is very wrong to kill any one,\" said Virginia, who at times had a\nsweet puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.\n\n\"Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very\nplain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about\ncookery. Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent\npricket, and do you know how she had it sent to table? However, it is\nno matter now, for it is all over, and I don't think it was very nice of\nher brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.\"\n\n\"Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost--I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry? I\nhave a sandwich in my case. Would you like it?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you,\nall the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\nvulgar, dishonest family.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Virginia, stamping her foot, \"it is you who are rude, and\nhorrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the\npaints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain\nin the library. First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and\nI couldn't do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the\nchrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese\nwhite, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing\nto look at, and not at all easy to paint. I never told on you, though I\nwas very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for\nwho ever heard of emerald-green blood?\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" said the Ghost, rather meekly, \"what was I to do? It is\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother\nbegan it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I\nshould not have your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of\ntaste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest\nin England; but I know you Americans don't care for things of this\nkind.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\nand improve your mind. My father will be only too happy to give you a\nfree passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind,\nthere will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are\nall Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\nhave a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family ghost.\"\n\n\"I don't think I should like America.\"\n\n\"I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,\" said Virginia,\nsatirically.\n\n\"No ruins! no curiosities!\" answered the Ghost; \"you have your navy and\nyour manners.\"\n\n\"Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week's\nholiday.\"\n\n\"Please don't go, Miss Virginia,\" he cried; \"I am so lonely and so\nunhappy, and I really don't know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I\ncannot.\"\n\n\"That's quite absurd! You have merely to go to bed and blow out the\ncandle. It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\nchurch, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why, even\nbabies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.\"\n\n\"I have not slept for three hundred years,\" he said sadly, and\nVirginia's beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; \"for three hundred\nyears I have not slept, and I am so tired.\"\n\nVirginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like\nrose-leaves. She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked\nup into his old withered face.\n\n\"Poor, poor Ghost,\" she murmured; \"have you no place where you can\nsleep?\"\n\n\"Far away beyond the pine-woods,\" he answered, in a low, dreamy voice,\n\"there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\nsings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold crystal\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\nsleepers.\"\n\nVirginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\n\n\"You mean the Garden of Death,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth,\nwith the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have\nno yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at\npeace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of death's\nhouse, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death\nis.\"\n\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\nthere was silence. She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\n\nThen the ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of\nthe wind.\n\n\"Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?\"\n\n\"Oh, often,\" cried the little girl, looking up; \"I know it quite well.\n\nIt is painted in curious black letters, and is difficult to read. There\nare only six lines:\n    \"'When a golden girl can win\n    Prayer from out the lips of sin,\n    When the barren almond bears,\n    And a little child gives away its tears,\n    Then shall all the house be still\n    And peace come to Canterville.'\n\n\"But I don't know what they mean.\"\n\n\"They mean,\" he said, sadly, \"that you must weep with me for my sins,\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle,\nthe angel of death will have mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\ncannot prevail.\"\n\nVirginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair\nas he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes. \"I am not afraid,\" she said\nfirmly, \"and I will ask the angel to have mercy on you.\"\n\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as\nhe led her across the dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were\nbroidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back. \"Go back! little Virginia,\"\n\nthey cried, \"go back!\" but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly,\nand she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails\nand goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and\nmurmured, \"Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,\"\n\nbut the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When\nthey reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she\ncould not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly\nfading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A\nbitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her\ndress. \"Quick, quick,\" cried the Ghost, \"or it will be too late,\" and\nin a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry\nChamber was empty.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VI\n\n\nAbout ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not\ncome down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia\nanywhere. As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\nevening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all\nalarmed at first, but when six o'clock struck, and Virginia did not\nappear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for\nher, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house. At\nhalf-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\nof their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of\nexcitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly\nremembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies\npermission to camp in the park. He accordingly at once set off for\nBlackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son\nand two of the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire, who was\nperfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too,\nbut Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a\nscuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gipsies had\ngone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as\nthe fire was still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.\n\nHaving sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran\nhome, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the\ncounty, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been\nkidnapped by tramps or gipsies. He then ordered his horse to be brought\nround, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down\nto dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with a groom. He had hardly,\nhowever, gone a couple of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after\nhim, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with\nhis face very flushed, and no hat. \"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,\" gasped\nout the boy, \"but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.\n\nPlease don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year,\nthere would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me back,\nwill you? I can't go! I won't go!\"\n\nThe Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace,\nand was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down\nfrom his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, \"Well,\nCecil, if you won't go back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must\nget you a hat at Ascot.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!\" cried the little Duke, laughing,\nand they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of\nthe station-master if any one answering to the description of Virginia\nhad been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her. The\nstation-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him\nthat a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a\nhat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his\nshutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away,\nwhich he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as there was a\nlarge common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman, but\ncould get no information from him, and, after riding all over the\ncommon, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase\nabout eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found\nWashington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with\nlanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest trace of\nVirginia had been discovered. The gipsies had been caught on Brockley\nmeadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they should be late. Indeed, they had\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's disappearance, as they\nwere very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his\npark, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search.\n\nThe carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone\nover, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any\nrate, Virginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest\ndepression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they\nfound a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\nwas poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and\nhaving her forehead bathed with eau de cologne by the old housekeeper.\n\nMr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up\nsupper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one\nspoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very\nfond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the\nentreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that\nnothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in\nthe morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down\nimmediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight\nbegan to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded\nthey heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder\nshook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a\npanel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out\non the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her\nhand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs.\nOtis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with\nviolent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.\n\n\"Good heavens! child, where have you been?\" said Mr. Otis, rather\nangrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them.\n\n\"Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and\nyour mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these\npractical jokes any more.\"\n\n\"Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!\" shrieked the twins, as they\ncapered about.\n\n\"My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side\nagain,\" murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair.\n\n\"Papa,\" said Virginia, quietly, \"I have been with the Ghost. He is dead,\nand you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was\nreally sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of\nbeautiful jewels before he died.\"\n\nThe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave\nand serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a\nlighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they\ncame to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia\ntouched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves\nin a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated\nwindow. Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was\na gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone\nfloor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers\nan old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its\nreach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was\ncovered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but\na pile of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding\nher little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the\nparty looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\ndisclosed to them.\n\n\"Hallo!\" suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out\nof the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\nsituated. \"Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.\"\n\n\"God has forgiven him,\" said Virginia, gravely, as she rose to her feet,\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.\n\n\"What an angel you are!\" cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round\nher neck, and kissed her.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VII\n\n\nFour days after these curious incidents, a funeral started from\nCanterville Chase at about eleven o'clock at night. The hearse was drawn\nby eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\nnodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\npurple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville\ncoat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\nservants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully\nimpressive. Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up\nspecially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first\ncarriage along with little Virginia. Then came the United States\nMinister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the\nlast carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had\nbeen frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she\nhad a right to see the last of him. A deep grave had been dug in the\ncorner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service\nwas read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, the servants, according to an old custom\nobserved in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as\nthe coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward,\nand laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms. As\nshe did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its\nsilent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a\nnightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of the\nGarden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a\nword during the drive home.\n\nThe next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given\nto Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby\nnecklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen\nof sixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis\nfelt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"I know that in this country mortmain is held to\napply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that\nthese jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg\nyou, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you\nunder certain strange conditions. As for my daughter, she is merely a\nchild, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such\nappurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I\nmay say, is no mean authority upon Art,--having had the privilege of\nspending several winters in Boston when she was a girl,--that these gems\nare of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\nprice. Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you\nwill recognize how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\nin the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such\nvain gauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\nBritish aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who\nhave been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles\nof Republican simplicity. Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box, as a memento of\nyour unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is extremely old, and\nconsequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to\ncomply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good deal\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with medi\u00e6valism\nin any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was\nborn in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned\nfrom a trip to Athens.\"\n\nLord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister's speech,\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile,\nand when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\nsaid: \"My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky\nancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are\nmuch indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck. The jewels\nare clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough\nto take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave\nin a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. As for their being\nheirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or\nlegal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite\nunknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and\nwhen Miss Virginia grows up, I dare say she will be pleased to have\npretty things to wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the\nfurniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to\nthe ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity\nSir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he\nwas really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase.\"\n\nMr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville's refusal, and\nbegged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was\nquite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to\nretain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of\n1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's first\ndrawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the\nuniversal theme of admiration. For Virginia received the coronet, which\nis the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her\nboy-lover as soon as he came of age. They were both so charming, and\nthey loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the\nmatch, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch\nthe Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less\nthan three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to\nsay, Mr. Otis himself. Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke\npersonally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his\nown words, \"was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating\ninfluences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of\nRepublican simplicity should be forgotten.\" His objections, however,\nwere completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the\naisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his\narm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of\nEngland.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to\nCanterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over\nin the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods. There had\nbeen a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir\nSimon's tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it\nsimply the initials of the old gentleman's name, and the verse from the\nlibrary window. The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses,\nwhich she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for\nsome time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There\nthe Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her\nfeet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly\nhe threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her,\n\"Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.\"\n\n\"Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have,\" he answered, smiling, \"you have never told me what\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.\"\n\n\"I have never told any one, Cecil,\" said Virginia, gravely.\n\n\"I know that, but you might tell me.\"\n\n\"Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you. Poor Sir Simon! I owe\nhim a great deal. Yes, don't laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see\nwhat Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than\nboth.\"\n\nThe Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.\n\n\"You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,\" he murmured.\n\n\"You have always had that, Cecil.\"\n\n\"And you will tell our children some day, won't you?\"\n\nVirginia blushed.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.\n\nYet Millet would have us understand that in spite of this, the\nshepherd is performing a duty to humanity not to be underrated. The\nsheep he has so carefully and conscientiously reared will form food\nto-morrow for many a hungry town-dweller. Further, he would have us\nfollow the peasant as he closes the pen for the night and traces his\ntired steps towards his simple home in the village. The frugal and\nhard-earned meal, prepared for him by his wife, who like himself has\nhad her share of duties to occupy her during the day, is partaken of\nsurrounded by a hungry and joyous group of children. Such themes\nsuggested by the simplicity of his own life appealed to him with\nirresistible force, and it is in their portrayal that his greatness is\nmanifested.\n\nPerhaps no season of the year presented the same attraction for Millet\nas the spring. The period when all the earth after its long winter\nsleep is about to waken into new life seems to have always been a\nsource of inspiration to him. In \"The Sower\" he emphasises the fact\nthat the fruits of the harvest are not to be had without due labour\nbeing expended upon the earth. The sloping field, barren of\nvegetation, and crowned at the top with a small clump of trees, is\nbeing broken up by the distant plough drawn by two horses and guided\nby a peasant. The latter figure is one of the noblest of Millet's\ncreations. By his strained and ever-attentive attitude, by his\ncontinuous tramp over the rough and broken ground, he shows us the\nmonotony of his toil. He crosses the field in one direction, only to\nreturn at an interval of a few feet. In the foreground we have the\nsower, a middle-aged man of typical peasant type, on whose left side a\nbag of seeds is slung. With automatic precision he withdraws a\nhandful, and strews it into the furrows open to receive it. So long as\nhe continues in the same track his labour will be well performed, and\nhence his task is just as monotonous as that of his fellow-worker\nhigher up in the field. The silhouetting of these two figures against\nthe light is symbolical of the labour to be expended in life before\nresults are forthcoming.\n\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that in considering the works of\nMillet, one must not judge him from the standpoint of a mere painter.\n\nHis brush is only the means to an end, and by its means he is enabled\nto bring the fruits of his philosophic observation before us in\npermanent form. It has been charged against the \"Angelus\" that it was\nnot a remarkably fine piece of painting, that many a young artist of\nthe present generation is infinitely better equipped, technically\nspeaking, than the master who wrought this celebrated canvas. This may\nin a measure be true, but it must never be forgotten that Millet\nbrought into play exactly the means which could illustrate his meaning\nin the clearest terms. He had not intended, in painting such a\npicture, to produce a work which would astonish his fellow artists\nwith its brilliancy of handling or magnificence of colour. He wanted\nto make the beholder forget the painter and absorb the lesson. This\nquality runs right through the art of Millet, and it is from this\nstandpoint that we are obliged to weigh his merits.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE\n\n\nJean Fran\u00e7ois Millet was born on October 4, 1814, that is at the\nperiod when French art, at any rate as far as landscape painting is\nconcerned, had reached its lowest ebb. Throughout the eighteenth\ncentury the landscape painter had been hard put to make a living. The\ntaste of connoisseurs throughout the century had been for portraits\nand interiors, or for those numerous pastoral subjects which were\ncarried out with so much decorative charm by such men as Watteau and\nBoucher. Such landscape painting as existed was of the type\npopularised by Vernet; it was built upon a curious mixture of Italian\ninfluence coming from Panini and Salvator Rosa. The only evidence of\nrevolt against such a state of affairs we find in the works of Hubert\nRobert and Moreau. These two, and more especially would I direct the\nreader's attention to the latter, struggled hard to break down the\nconventionalities of the time. They endeavoured to infuse some sense\nof atmosphere into their pictures, and whilst frequently their trees\nand figures are painfully formal, they yet stand alone in the French\nschool as the pioneers of a phase of art which was to attain its\nzenith in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBut after the Revolution, and during the whole of the time that France\nwas under the domination of Napoleon, very rigid principles indeed\nwere enforced with regard to the direction that art should take. The\ninnovation which had its commencement in the reign of Louis XVI. swept\neverything before it as it gained force. Classical art and traditions\ndominated the whole French school, and no artist, however great his\nreputation, attempted for many years to swim against the stream. In\nspite of the principles of liberty and equality which were claimed for\nall under the new r\u00e9gime, a terribly strict eye was kept upon any\ninnovations which might break out in the form of a naturalistic art.\n\nThe directors of this new movement failed to see that the conditions\nwhich had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed\naway, and that the latter's supremacy was due to the fact that their\nproductions were symbolical of the loftiest thoughts of their own\nepoch. The art which expresses the ambitions and noblest thoughts of\nits time will alone endure. These expressions are not applicable to\nany other condition than those which called them forth, and hence in\nattempting to purify the rococo which had existed up to the middle of\nthe eighteenth century, by a return to classical traditions, they were\nonly copying that which their predecessors had done, and in so doing\nleft us without any original expression of their own time.\n\nInto such a condition of affairs was Millet born, and he was numbered\namongst that little band of men which included Rousseau, Corot, Dupr\u00e9,\nDiaz, and Daumier, who were to lay the foundations of the modern\nnaturalistic school. At the outset it was seemingly a hopeless\nstruggle they undertook; a struggle against prejudice and influence\nwhich was only to be brought to a victorious culmination after years\nof struggle and disappointment. Of this little band, Millet was\nperhaps the best equipped for the privations which were necessary. He\ncame of a peasant stock who inhabited Gruchy, a small village\nsituated in the commune of Gr\u00e9ville, close to Cherbourg. Grouped\nunderneath the humble roof was the grandmother, who had been left a\nwidow fifteen years before; her son, Jean Louis Nicolas Millet, and\nhis wife and eight children, of which our artist was the second. His\ngrandmother appears to have been a pious old lady, whose chief delight\nwas in her grandchildren, to whom she taught those religious\nprinciples which stood them in good stead in after life. We are told\nthat Millet's father possessed a force of character one does not often\nfind amongst men in his rank of life. He was of a contemplative\ndisposition, and had a keenly developed feeling for natural beauty. He\npossessed moreover a keen appreciation of music, which unfortunately\nhe does not appear to have had much opportunity of cultivating. His\nwife was an excellent housewife and of a religious turn of mind. The\nhouse they occupied, situated quite a short distance from the sea, was\nplaced in a tract of country which, whilst it had rugged and\npicturesque features, was not of a nature which would yield\nextraordinary results under cultivation. It was, therefore, a hard\nstruggle for existence which Millet in his first years saw going\non around him. Not that the family were any the less happy for having\nto work laboriously for their livelihood. They had been brought up\namidst such surroundings; their wants were simple and easily\ngratified, and the tranquillity of the m\u00e9nage more than\ncounterbalanced those doubtful luxuries which easier circumstances\nwould have brought their way. Throughout his life Millet maintained\nthe extreme simplicity he had seen practised in the home of his\nchildhood, and long years afterwards he was accustomed to look back\nwith pleasureable memories upon his early years.\n\nGruchy, situated in one of the wildest parts of Normandy, feels the\nfull effect of every storm which blows up from the Atlantic. There is\nnothing to shelter the exposed hamlets studded along the coast from\nthe fury of the western gale, and the rocks are but too often strewn\nwith the wrecks of vessels which have come to grief in that terrible\nsea. Millet in his youth must have witnessed many of these\ncatastrophes. Quite a number of drawings by him are extant\nrepresenting succour being extended to some vessel in difficulties, or\nthe hauling up of some wreckage on to the rocks. The studious boy\nmust have been impressed as he saw the sternness of the combat in his\nnative country between men and nature; the wind-swept fields, and\nhills bare to the point of savageness. The very trees themselves\ndwarfed and gnarled; in their struggle with the elements they have\nbeen made tough and hardy as the inhabitants of the country\nthemselves, and, stunted as they are, yet show well that they can\nresist the force of the fiercest storm. The brooding and contemplative\ncharacter of the father having descended to the son, we can quite\nimagine the effect such surroundings would have upon him. As he looked\nback in after years upon his roamings in his native country, he\nappreciated the awe-inspiring character of the scenery in which he had\nbeen born. He would doubtless recall many a walk amidst the fields\nwith the wind blowing in his face as it rushed in from the Atlantic,\nthe rain beating hard upon the freshly ploughed fields, and the\ndistant figure of the ploughman struggling hard with his team against\nthe stiff sou'wester. The great mass of vapour overhead whirled before\nthe violence of the storm, casting grey and pearly light over the\nwhole scene, whilst far away on the top of the hill a clump of trees,\nbent with their resistance to the wind, are silhouetted against the\nsky. Many a drawing of this kind we encounter in the later work of\nMillet, which shows how his thoughts harked back in certain moments to\nthe scenes he had left behind him for ever.\n\nWe know that on one or two occasions he returned to Gruchy. Once or\ntwice he had urgent business which took him back, but sometimes he\nwent with no other purpose than to renew acquaintance with the scenes\nof yore.\n\nLittle Jean Fran\u00e7ois was his grandmother's favourite. It was she who\ntaught him the names of things which surrounded him, and perhaps\ndirected his thoughts in the channels to which they were finally to be\ndevoted. Her brother Charles, who formed one of the family, used to\ntake him for walks, telling him stories on the way. Millet was\ndevotedly attached to this old man, and when at the age of seven years\nhe lost him, the gap in his life thus left made an impression upon his\nmemory never to be effaced.\n\nFive years afterwards he was placed in the hands of the vicar for the\npurpose of preparing him for his first communion. The good man seems\nto have been taken with the child; he found him so attentive to all\nnatural phenomenon which was passing around him and intelligent in an\nunusual degree. He quickly learnt a considerable amount of Latin,\nwhich introduced him to the great classics. Unfortunately for Millet,\nthe vicar accepted an offer of transference to a better parish in the\nvicinity. The boy had made such progress with his master that it was\ndecided that he should go with him to his new abode. He was, however,\nso missed in his own home, that when he came back for his first\nholidays it was decided that he should not return.\n\nHe now gave serious attention to the agricultural pursuits of his\nfather. He threw himself heartily into the work of the farm, and\nassisted in the work of sowing and harvesting, of pruning and\nthrashing according to the season. His spare time was occupied in\nreading with avidity various masterpieces of literature. The authors\nhe found at hand were such as F\u00e9n\u00e9lon and Bossuet, but he developed a\ndecided preference, which lasted till the end of his life, for Virgil\nand the Bible.\n\nIt was at this time that his taste for art began to be developed.\n\nHe drew the objects he found around him, and soon acquired sufficient\nconfidence in his skill to execute a large drawing representing two\nshepherds keeping guard over their sheep. These first efforts date\nfrom about his seventeenth year, and foretell the advent of the style\nin which he was later to become pre-eminent.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE MIGRATION TO PARIS\n\n\nHow frequently has it happened that the first years in the life of a\ngenius have been employed in labour quite different from that to which\nthey should have been directed. Such a state of affairs the more often\noccurs when the sense of duty has been strong enough to overcome\ntemporarily the inclination to pursue the natural bent. In the case of\nMillet, however, the early years which he devoted to the farm and its\npursuits were by no means wasted. It is on record that he became very\nproficient in the various duties in which he was engaged, but at the\nsame time we can be quite sure that his extraordinary faculties of\nobservation were constantly being brought into play, and the fruits of\nhis observations are to be seen in the pictures of his mature period.\n\nA considerable portion of his spare time was taken up with drawing,\nnot only the persons and objects he found around him, but also\nsubjects suggested to him by the books he was in the habit of reading.\n\nHis family, so far from throwing any obstacles in his way, encouraged\nhim. In fact it was his father who took him first to Cherbourg in\norder to show a painter of that town, named Mouchel, the early\nproducts of his son's genius. The decision at which Millet p\u00e8re had\narrived was prompted by a drawing in charcoal of an old peasant\nwalking along the road, which had struck him forcibly as being a work\nof extraordinary merit. It says much for Mouchel's breadth of mind\nthat he was equally impressed with the drawings. A man who had been\nbrought up in the school of David, and who had lived in one of the\nmost reactionary periods of French art, was hardly to be expected to\ntake kindly to a style so diametrically opposed to all the traditions\ninto which he himself had been inculcated; certainly the young\nMillet, who had now arrived at the age of eighteen, had not developed\nthe extraordinary freedom which his works of ten years later\ndemonstrate. But there was sufficient originality even in his early\ndrawings to call forth condemnation from a man who had been so\nsaturated with the teaching of David.\n\nHe prevailed upon Millet to leave his son with him, and set him to\nwork to copy many well-known works of art which he brought before his\npupil by means of engravings. Two months were spent in this way when\nnews reached Millet that his father had been seized with sudden\nillness, and he was obliged in the circumstances to return to\nGr\u00e9ville. He arrived to find the old man unconscious, and very shortly\nafterwards he died.\n\nThis misfortune awoke in Millet a sense of duty which compelled him to\ndesert his studies in Cherbourg and superintend the management of the\nfarm. For some time he devoted himself entirely to his new duties, but\nthe struggle betwixt duty and genius continued; he gave himself to his\nwork with all the energy at his disposal, but his thoughts were ever\nwandering to his art.\n\nAdded to his own inclinations, his grandmother, who perceived his\nextraordinary gifts, strongly persuaded him to devote his attention\nentirely to art, and consequently after some little time he decided to\nreturn to Cherbourg. Here he entered the studio of M. Langlois, an\nartist whose reputation in the town was considerable. Again in this\nworthy man he came in contact with a painter who had been brought up\nentirely under classical influence. Langlois, who had in his early\ndays been a pupil of Gros, had absorbed the classical tradition to\nsuch an extent as to be incapable of appreciating any other style. He\nappears to have endeavoured to mould Millet in his own method rather\nthan develop the latent genius which the latter possessed. The\nincompatibility of these two men speedily caused the younger to strike\nout in his own way. He saw more good in frequenting the museums and\nmaking copies of such works as appealed to him than in listening to\nthe advice of his teacher. All this occurred, however, without any\nbreach of friendship occurring. On the contrary, Langlois, after\nperceiving the futility of inducing his pupil to follow in his\nfootsteps, did all he could to advance his interests.\n\nBy means of his influence some of Millet's drawings were brought\nbefore the Municipal Council, and Langlois suggested that Millet\nshould be sent to Paris in order to further his development, and that\nthe Council should set aside a modest pension to meet his requirements\nin that city. The discussion appears to have been very prolonged, and\nupon the question being put to a vote it was only carried by means of\nthe casting vote of the mayor. Four hundred francs was at first\nallotted to him in this way, which was further increased shortly\nafterwards to six hundred. Such encouragement, meagre though it was,\nwas sufficient to give him a foothold in the metropolis. He left\nCherbourg in January 1837, on a cold and raw day, the snow falling\nheavily throughout the entire journey, and arrived in Paris in a very\ndisheartened condition. The miserable weather, coupled with the long\njourney in which he had had time to think of the small sum which lay\nbetween him and starvation, going to a city which he had never seen\nbefore, had all served to work upon his nerves, and he entered the\ngreat city sick at heart and very despondent.\n\nOne of the first visits he made after he was somewhat settled down in\nParis was to the Louvre. Here he was brought into contact for the\nfirst time with many masters, who were to mould his yet plastic\ntemperament into the form which enabled him to give to the world, in\nlater years, so many masterpieces. As I have said before, it was\nMantegna who first captivated him, and the influence of the mighty\nPaduan was never finally to be shaken off. Michel Angelo awed him with\nhis sublimity; his classical severity tempered with intense humanism,\nhis masculine strength, were bound to have their effect upon so\nserious a character as Millet. Strange as it may seem to those who are\nbut superficially acquainted with his art, and are only too apt to\njudge him by the influence he has had upon modern French painting, he\nwas fascinated with the antique. The traditions of Phidias and\nPraxiteles, in the form in which they had been transmitted through the\ngreatest minds of the Renaissance, were ever the factors which guided\nhim throughout his career. It was this same spirit which impelled his\nfervid admiration for Nicolas Poussin, a master who to-day is sadly\nunderrated and but little understood. It was the mysteries of line,\nthe wonders of pose and composition rather than the magic of colour\nwhich appealed to him. He had a profound admiration for the glowing\ncanvases of Titian and Rubens, but he could never overlook entirely\ntheir defects of drawing or, in the case of Rubens, the tendency to\nvulgarity. From his remarks in after years it would appear that he was\nbaffled with the mysticisms of Velazquez and Rembrandt; pure painting\nitself could never hold him. He needed to grasp the message which lay\nbehind it before he felt fully taken into the confidence of the\npainter; and as the minds of the Dutchman and the Spaniard ran in\nquite different channels to his own, they spoke with a language he\nnever understood. That he had a perceptive and critically independent\nmind may be gauged from his enthusiasm for Delacroix, whose work he\nencountered for the first time at the Luxembourg.\n\nDuring this period of study he was carefully considering under what\nmaster he should place himself. His choice unhappily fell upon\nDelaroche. To any one acquainted with the work of the latter master,\na more unsuitable selection could not have been made. Delaroche and\nthe painters who surrounded him can be appropriately described as\nconstituting the back-wash of the Empire style, which had reached its\nclimax with David. His subjects were always treated with academic\nreserve. No pyrotechnics were permitted; on the contrary, an\neverlasting and mistaken striving for finish was encouraged:\noriginality was sternly suppressed. To paint human life as it really\nwas, was too vulgar for any of the painters of this time. They held\nthe public taste enslaved for years. An innovator such as Millet was\ndestined to become found his position almost untenable. The band of\ncritics and painters formed a monopoly which it seemed almost\nimpossible to break down, and it was only after years of bitter and\ndetermined struggle that the school of nature finally routed its\nopponent.\n\nDelaroche doubtlessly found the peasant painter a little rude both in\nhis person and in his ideas about art. He paid but little attention to\nthe young man who had placed himself in his hands, and devoted all his\ntime to students who were more amenable to his influence. A\ntemperament so sensitive as Millet's was bound to notice this\nneglect, and consequently after a time he became so discouraged that\nhe ceased to frequent Delaroche's studio. Another very good reason for\nthis action was the lack of resources to continue his payments. Even\nduring the time he had been with Delaroche he lost no opportunity of\nturning a few honest francs by painting the portraits of any who could\nbe got to sit to him. Delaroche, however, had a more kindly heart than\nMillet imagined. He seems to have found out the real distress of the\nyoung artist, and to have assisted him pecuniarily in many ways, and\nthere is no doubt that he appreciated the talent of the young Norman\nmuch more than he cared to own. Many of his remarks on record would\nserve to show that Delaroche already felt that his pupil was destined\nto be one of the leaders of the movement which was finally to\noverthrow his own style, and doubtlessly felt a great admiration for a\nman who had the courage and strength to swim against rather than with\nthe current.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STRUGGLE FOR RECOGNITION\n\n\nFreed from all encumbrances save poverty, Millet was now to work out\nhis own destiny according to the dictates of his genius. He joined a\nfriend named Marolle, and the two together occupying a very small\napartment endeavoured to eke out an existence. It was only too soon\napparent that young as he was, and the taste of the public being not\nyet ready for development upon the lines his genius directed him, that\nhis livelihood could not be secured by endeavouring to sell such\nsubjects as appealed to him. In these straits he turned to\nportrait-painting, just as many great painters before and since him\nhave done. That the struggle was very keen can well be imagined by the\nfact that he was unable to obtain more than five to ten francs apiece;\nand, as commissions were very scarce, he was hard put to gain the\nmeans of subsistence. This state of affairs lasted until 1840, in\nwhich year he endeavoured to obtain admission to the Salon with two\nportraits, one of which was that of his friend. This, however, was\nrejected, and the other picture, although accepted, was unnoticed by\neither the critics or the public.\n\nHaving occasion the next year to pay a visit to Cherbourg, he felt\nobliged to report himself to the Municipal Council who had had the\ngenerosity to send him in the first place to Paris. Its worthy members\nexpressed themselves as but little satisfied with the result of their\ninvestment; they claimed that they had had as yet but little to show\nfor their money, and they suggested, partly as a means of\ndemonstrating that they had had some little return, and also, in order\nto see of what stuff their prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was made, that he should paint a\nportrait of the recently deceased mayor. As Millet had not been\npersonally acquainted with that worthy citizen, and as the only guide\nwhich could be supplied him was a portrait made in miniature when he\nwas a young man of some twenty-three or twenty-four years of age, the\ntask was by no means easy. However, the artist set to work with a\nwill, and finally accomplished the picture to his own satisfaction.\n\nUpon it being shown to the Council, one and all declared, as any one\nwith the slightest knowledge of such matters could have told them\nbefore it was commenced, that it bore not the least resemblance to the\ndefunct magistrate. They therefore demurred at the three hundred\nfrancs they had agreed to pay him for the portrait, and offered him\none-third of that amount instead. Millet was deeply offended by the\ninsult, and informed the Council that he made them a present of the\npicture.\n\nIt was during this short visit to his native country that he met his\nfirst wife, a Mlle. Ono, whose portrait he had painted. From the first\nshe was very delicate, and he lost her after much suffering, three\nyears later. His second wife was Mlle. Catherine Lemaire, who was\ndestined to be the companion of his struggles until the end of his\nlife.\n\nMeanwhile Millet was occupied with subjects which he thought would\nappeal to the general public. A number of classical pictures date from\nthis epoch. It was an endeavour on his part to fall in as far as\npossible with the current taste, and so supply means of subsistence\nfor his family. At the same time he did not neglect his favourite\nsubjects, and many are the wonderful studies of peasant life which\ndate from these years. His reputation had so far advanced that he was\noffered the position of teacher of drawing in the college at\nCherbourg. It must have been only after prolonged deliberation that he\nrefused the proffered post. Here a certain annual stipend was assured\nhim, and if it was not large in itself it would at any rate suffice to\nkeep the wolf from the door. He preferred, however, to return to Paris\nand work out his own destiny as best he might.\n\nMillet, who lived at this time in the Rue Rochechouart, began to\nsurround himself with that little group of friends who remained\nfaithful to him until the end of his career. Amongst the earliest were\nCharles Jacque and Diaz: the latter had several clients amongst the\nsmall dealers, whom he induced to visit Millet's studio and make now\nand again a small purchase.\n\nMillet now became a fairly regular contributor to the Salon, but\ngenerally sent some classical or religious picture as well as one of\nhis peasant subjects. For example, in 1848 he sent the marvellous\nstudy of \"The Winnower,\" which we all know so well, accompanied by a\ncanvas, \"The Captivity of the Jews at Babylon.\" The latter, however,\nwas so badly received that he utilised the canvas upon its return for\na large picture of a \"Shepherdess tending her Sheep.\"\n\nIn spite of the headway that he was making, the struggle for existence\nseemed keener than ever, and but for the kindness of friends he and\nhis family would frequently have actually wanted for food. A timely\nadvance of one hundred francs obtained for him from the Minister of\nFine Arts, together with a commission from the State, for which he was\npaid the sum of eighteen hundred francs, were for some time the only\nrelief he obtained from his embarrassments. That he was not particular\nas to how he earned his daily bread is apparent from the fact that he\ndid not despise an order for a shop sign for a midwife, for which he\nwas paid the miserable amount of thirty francs.\n\nThe year 1848 was not an encouraging one for a painter who was\nstanding on the threshold of his career. The whole of Europe was\nseething with revolution. A repetition of the fearful year of 1792 was\neverywhere expected. The struggle betwixt reaction and property on the\none hand, and lawlessness and revolution on the other, was being waged\nwith grim determination. The issue was for long in the balance. One\nnever knew from one day to another what was going to happen. In such a\ndeplorable state of affairs men's minds were running on politics and\nwars rather than upon art. Millet amongst the rest was called upon to\nshoulder the musket, and it can be easily imagined with what\nreluctance he did so.\n\nParis, the great centre of art, had yet not afforded him much\nencouragement. Life was dear in the big city, and surrounded on all\nsides by bricks and mortar he was not free to go out into the fields\nand study the objects which were uppermost in his mind. He resolved to\nescape from it, and once having put the plan into execution he never\nreturned.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET IN HIS MATURITY\n\n\nThe Barbizon of 1850 was a very different place from the Barbizon of\nto-day. The world fame of the men who passed a quiet and strenuous\nexistence in the little village has transformed it into a tourist\nresort, with restaurants and caf\u00e9s, the stopping-places for\nwaggonettes which in summer bring their daily load of sightseers,\neager to see the homes of the painters whose names are now household\nwords.\n\nIt would have been well-nigh impossible for the little band to have\nchosen a more suitable spot for their labours. Rousseau and Millet,\nmuch as they were drawn towards each other by the tie of a sympathetic\ndisposition and by their common interest in art, yet were widely\ndissimilar from one another in their outlook upon art and their\nmethods of worship at the common shrine. Rousseau--one can see it from\nevery picture he painted--loved with all the yearning of a passionate\nand restless temperament the inanimate in Nature. Observe with what\nfidelity he draws his trees, with what caressing tenderness his clouds\nand skies are treated; solitude appealed to him above all things, and\nif here and there he was obliged to insert a few figures to complete\nhis composition, one instinctively feels that he would rather have\nsubstituted a group of cattle or a flock of sheep. In the glades of\nthe forest, far from the busy haunts of men, with the glorious\nsunlight penetrating from above, the breeze moaning through the\nbranches, he was happy. A wild and turbulent temperament such as his\nnot infrequently discovers exquisite enjoyment amidst such perfect\ntranquillity.\n\nBarbizon, situated on the fringe of the great forest of Fontainebleau,\ntherefore, permitted Rousseau to come into daily contact with the\nscenes which so appealed to him.\n\nMillet, on the other hand, was absorbed in the peasant. The man who\ntilled the soil and raised the produce humanity requires for its\nsubsistence by the sweat of his brow; the manifold duties of the\nlabourer, his life and sorrows, appealed to him with irresistible\nforce. An unpeopled track of wild and uncultivated land would not call\nforth any emotion in him, no matter how sublime the scenery might be.\n\nThe life of the village, spreading itself into the vast and fertile\nplain behind, held him absorbed; a peasant himself and living amongst\nthe people he so loved, he was in a position to bring before an\nunthinking world the poignant monotony of their useful lives.\n\nUpon their first arrival at Barbizon, the two artists put up at a\nsmall inn, working all day in a tiny place they had rented from some\npeasants and fitted up as a studio. The inconveniences of this\narrangement were soon apparent, and shortly afterwards Millet took a\nsmall house which was destined to be his abode for the remainder of\nhis life; an old barn in the immediate vicinity meanwhile provided him\nwith an excellent studio.\n\nFrom this period onward we must date the greatest productions of the\nmaster, the works which have induced more thought than those of any\nother peasant painter. A peasant among peasants, his life was of the\nmost rigid simplicity. Behind his little abode a large garden\nstretched away almost to the fringe of the forest itself, and here he\nwas accustomed to work every morning, growing a portion of the food\nnecessary to the sustenance of his family. The afternoon he devoted to\npainting, whilst the evening was given over to intercourse with his\nlittle circle of friends. The simplicity and tranquillity of his life\naroused the whole of his powers to action, and surrounded with\neverything he valued in life he was supremely happy.\n\nThe country around Barbizon appealed to him irresistibly. The\ntimber-studded plains, the gently undulating, highly cultivated\nfields, presented a strange contrast to the wild and rugged country\namidst which he had spent his childhood, and no doubt conduced to the\ndevelopment of a more refined and contemplative style than he would\notherwise have acquired. Upon his few visits to his native country he\nappears to have been more impressed than ever with its austerity, and\nthe drawings which these journeys called forth bore ample evidence of\nthis feeling in him.\n\nLack of the necessary funds to carry on even his simple m\u00e9nage was\never the bane of Millet's life. On many occasions Sensier, his\nintimate friend and afterwards his biographer, informs us he dissuaded\nhim from suicide.\n\nThe sums that he owed, small though they were, rendered him in\nconstant fear of the brokers. With creditors so importunate in their\ndemands for satisfaction, and with the constant lack of recognition,\nwhich was his lot, it is astonishing that Millet achieved so much. He\nwas relieved more than once by the kind-hearted and ever faithful\nRousseau, who when his friend was sorest pressed found some delicately\nhidden means to relieve him. It was he who acquired for 4000 francs\nthe wonderful \"Peasant grafting a Tree,\" when the picture failed to\nfind a purchaser; and in order that Millet should not be aware of his\ngenerosity, he made the offer in the name of an imaginary American.\n\nThis sort of goodness he repeated more than once, and it redounds\nstill more to his credit when we remember that Rousseau himself was\nnot infrequently in pecuniary difficulties.\n\nA constant succession of important works made their appearance during\nthe first ten years Millet spent at Barbizon. The first was the\nwell-known \"Sower,\" which has ever been one of the most popular of his\npictures. Then came the far finer \"Peasants going to Work,\" which for\nmany years was in an English Collection. The \"Gleaners,\" perhaps the\nnoblest canvas the master ever painted, dates from 1857, in which year\nit was seen at the Salon; the celebrated \"Angelus\" followed it two\nyears later. The prices which Millet obtained for this series of\nremarkable works was fantastically small. The \"Gleaners\" brought him a\npaltry 2000 francs, whilst he accounted himself lucky to encounter an\namateur who gave him the same sum for the small \"Woman feeding Fowls.\"\n\nThe \"Angelus,\" which was never exhibited, was sold in the year it was\npainted to a Monsieur Feydeau, an architect, for 1800 francs. It then\npassed through several hands before the late Monsieur Secr\u00e9tan\ncompeted up to 160,000 francs before he became possessed of the prize\nat the John Wilson sale.\n\nThe purchase, however, proved a sound investment, for upon the\ndispersal of his collection it was knocked down for 553,000 francs to\na Monsieur Proust, acting on behalf of the French Government. The\nlatter, however, when they gave the commission to buy the picture, had\nno idea that such a high value would be placed upon it, and\nconsequently refused to ratify the sale; a syndicate now came upon the\nscene, who took it to America. The price, however, proved greater than\neven the millionaires of the States were prepared to give, and the\ncanvas again returned to France, where it found a resting-place in the\ncollection of Monsieur Chauchard, who paid the enormous sum of 800,000\nfrancs for its possession.\n\nIn 1859 Millet sent two works to the Salon, a \"Woman grazing her Cow,\"\nand \"Death and the Woodman.\" The latter, one of the most\nphilosophical of Millet's pictures, which to-day is the principal\nattraction of the Jacobsen Museum at Copenhagen, was rejected.\n\nDisappointments of this kind came with such systematic regularity to\nthe painter that he must have become proof against them. He always had\nbitter enemies amongst the critics, who never failed to pour abuse\nupon his method and his subjects. Even a number of his fellow artists\njoined in the chorus of disapproval. But the vehemence with which he\nwas attacked was striking evidence of the impression he was making and\nthe inward sense of his own powers; and the fact that he was working\nout his destiny according to the dictates of his own genius supported\nhim against this outpouring of prejudice and malice. The social side\nof life appealed to him more strongly as the years rolled on, and the\nmurmurings which had been heard in 1859 as to the socialistic\ntendencies of \"Death and the Woodman\" swelled to a roar when the\nstupendous \"Man with the Hoe\" was exhibited fourteen years later. The\nlatter, one of the most virile studies of depraved humanity which the\nworld has ever seen, has always been a favourite with social\nreformers, and has inspired one remarkable poem. Even his most\nimplacable critics were disarmed before this canvas; its power was\nmagnetic; it was an inspiration, soul moving and trenchant.\n\nHis financial difficulties never completely dispersed. At one time, in\norder to insure himself a little tranquillity, he made a contract with\ntwo speculators, whereby they were to become possessors of all the\nwork he produced for three years, in consideration of their assuring\nhim a thousand francs a month. A great number of Millet's finest\nproductions passed thus through their hands, including the \"Return\nfrom the Fields\" and the \"Man with the Hoe.\" The partners were not\nlong in quarrelling, and after a lawsuit had been fought, Millet was\nleft in the hands of a man who frequently would not or could not pay\nhim in ready money, and whose bills he was frequently forced to\ndiscount at considerable loss.\n\nOne little gleam of sunshine rendered his later days happy. This was a\ncommission from a Colmar banker, Monsieur Thomas by name, who required\nfour allegorical compositions representing the Seasons, to decorate\nhis rooms. The artist was overjoyed by this piece of good fortune,\nand immediately commenced a most conscientious study of such mural\ndecoration as was within reach, in order that he might do full justice\nto his patron. He paid frequent visits to Fontainebleau and the\nLouvre, and even desired a friend to inquire if he could not obtain\nreproductions of the frescoes at Herculaneum and Pompeii. In spite of\nall this elaborate preparation, the subjects were not such as appealed\nto his genius, and in spite of them being well and soundly painted, we\nare told that they presented no features which called for special\ncomment.\n\nHe found, however, a much more genial occupation in accomplishing a\nseries of drawings ordered by a Monsieur Gavet, who paid the artist\n1000, 700, and 450 francs each, according to their size. He made\naltogether ninety-five drawings in this way, and it is said that this\ngentleman had in his possession the finest work in black and white and\nwater-colour the artist ever executed.\n\nTowards the latter end of his life the death of dear relatives and\nfriends cast a sorrowful gloom over him. Amongst the latter Rousseau,\nwho expired in his presence on the 22nd of December 1867, was\nperhaps the loss which seemed to him hardest to bear. A staunch and\ntrusty friend, who was to be relied upon when his prospects seemed the\nmost hopeless, he had been one of the very few who had appreciated\nMillet's talents at their full worth, and who, moreover, scanty as his\nown means were, was ever ready to stretch out his hand to assist his\nstruggling friend.\n\nShortly afterwards Millet paid a visit to his patron, Herr Hartmann,\nat M\u00fcnster, and from here he went for a short time into Switzerland.\n\nUpon his return he devoted himself with great earnestness to work, and\nachieved a certain success at the Salons with his exhibits. The\noutbreak of the war with Germany caused him to migrate with his family\nto Cherbourg, where he thought he might continue to work, removed as\nfar as possible from the scenes of carnage and struggle which were\ngoing on farther east. Transported once more amongst the scenes of his\nchildhood, he felt an increased impetus to production, and when he\nreturned to Barbizon late in 1871, he brought with him a number of\ncanvases of the highest quality; conspicuous amongst them was the\nwonderful \"Gr\u00e9ville Church,\" now in the Louvre.\n\nThe anxieties of his troublous life were, however, beginning to show\ntheir effect upon his constitution; a persistent cough developed, and\nalthough an amelioration would occasionally occur, it was always\nsucceeded by a worse condition than before. His health suffered a\ngeneral decline, and he finally breathed his last on the 20th of\nJanuary 1875. He was buried in the little cemetery of Chailly, beside\nhis friend Rousseau, amidst the scenery they both loved so well.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE MAN AND HIS ART\n\n\nMillet is an instance of an artist working out his own destiny,\nimpelled by irresistible genius, in the teeth of seemingly\ninsurmountable obstacles. He started life with enormous disadvantages;\nwithout friends in influential circles to spread his fame or plead his\ncause; without money to enable him to outlive and triumph over the\nignorant fanaticism of critics and artists, so soaked in the\nconventionalised art of their time that they had not perception enough\nto appreciate the full meaning of that naturalistic movement, which\nwas finally to sweep away the quasi-classic art they boasted of with\nsuch bombastic effusion. The path was hard and thorny, and his triumph\nwas not finally consummated until after his death. He himself found\nhis only satisfaction in the fact that he had lived his life according\nto the dictates of his genius, and had achieved the maximum of which\nhe was capable.\n\nMillet and our own Cotman were somewhat kindred spirits; there is much\nmore affinity between the work of the two men than is apparent to any\none who has not closely studied them. The marvellous \"Breaking the\nClod,\" now happily permanently housed at the British Museum, betrays\nthe same tremendous conception and broad outlook which characterises\nmany a drawing of Millet's. Both highly strung to a painful extent,\nthey were each conscious of their inability to curb the power which\nprescribed a certain course for them, and in spite of pecuniary\ndifficulties and unpopularity, an inevitable result of their intense\noriginality, they pursued a steady course to the end of their lives.\n\nThe socialistic doctrines which have been read into the work of Millet\nare rather the outcome of the world's uneasy conscience being brought\nface to face with a crushing indictment of existing conditions, than\nof any design on the artist's part to further the cause of a political\npropaganda by means of his art. This somewhat extravagant reading into\nhis art has certainly been carried to excess. Particularly has such\nbeen the case in America, where a large number of his finest works are\nat present to be found, curiously enough in the hands of enormously\nwealthy people, who are frequently perhaps the least able to\nunderstand the real meaning of his message.\n\nComing from a peasant stock, his sympathies were always with the\npeasant; it was the only class he understood or cared for. He lived as\none of them, and shared to a large extent in their labour. He has been\ndesignated, not inappropriately, the philosopher in sabots. Rightly or\nwrongly he has come to be looked upon as one of the high priests of\ncommunistic doctrines. Few pictures have been so anathematised as the\n\"Man with the Hoe,\" and perhaps none have done more to inculcate\nsympathy with the degradation of the lower orders of the human race.\n\nThe revolting brutality and vacancy of that face haunts the\nimagination. Is it possible that fellow-creatures so utterly debased\nby toil and neglect exist? Millet dispels any doubt upon the question\nby bequeathing to humanity this trenchant portrait. By no means\nlimited to Barbizon or France, these poor creatures exist in every\ncountry, and curiously enough are considered an essential element in\neach country's development.\n\nThis poignantly human note is observable in almost every work Millet\nwrought; his passionate sympathy with his fellow-man is the keynote of\nhis art. The wood-cutter in his arduous toil, the shepherd in his\nsolitariness, the labourer turning the soil with unvarying and\nlaborious monotony, the mother caring for her children--all carry the\nsame message for him of that strange and incomprehensible mingling of\njoy and sadness we call life. Like many great minds before and since\nhis time, our artist found the greatest joy in life in a placid and\nnever changing melancholy. But the peasants he chose knew nothing of\nthe sadness he saw in them. Completely inured to their toil, and\nsubdued by it, with no refining or uplifting influence to stimulate\nthem, they knew nothing, aspired to nothing beyond what they were; it\nwas left to Millet to supply the \"might have been.\" He saw the inky\nblackness of the mind of the \"Man with the Hoe,\" the pathetic\ninequality between the mounted farmer directing the safe storage of\nhis crop, and the stooping figures of the \"Gleaners\" eager to scrape\nup the miserable crumbs which had fallen from the rich man's table. He\ntraced the lives of these simple folk until we arrive at the grim and\ngaunt figure of Death, who, as he grasps the woodman by the shoulder,\nreminds him that his course is finished and that he, in common with\nall his fellow-men, must enter the great unknown land from which there\nis no return. It is a sad and melancholy art, vibrating with purity\nand truth, the outpouring of a great soul yearning to express itself\nto the utmost of its power. The mind and character of the man can be\nread in every line and in every touch of the brush. His drawings and\netchings are even more searching in their virility than his pictures.\n\nThere is a spontaneousness about them we search for in vain in his\nwork in oil and pastel. In black and white his intensely emotional\nmind found a swift method of expression; in the laboriousness of oil\npainting he was fettered with the complications of the medium. It can\nbe fairly said that only in one or two paintings--a notable example\ncan be cited in the wondrous \"Sawyers\" at South Kensington--does he\nrise to the height of a great painter. Millet was a poet, a\nphilosopher, a great thinker, and the means he chose for expressing\nhimself were those which were best fitted to his purpose. His\npredilections in art were concentrated upon the greatest, and\nconsequently the men who appealed to him were the thinkers of the\nages. Mantegna and Correggio, Michel Angelo and the mighty Greeks,\nthese were the masters who left their impress upon his mind and art.\n\nThe influence of so sincere and profound an artist has necessarily\nbeen profound. He has moulded men who have achieved world-wide fame;\nSegantini, for example, would never have risen to the heights he did\nhad the example of Millet not been ever before him. There have been\nmany who, without possessing his genius, have endeavoured to follow\nin his footsteps, but successfully as his imitators have sometimes\ncaught his style, their productions can never live alongside his,\nbecause they lack the real ring of sincerity.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n        a. One bed, or folding cot,\n        b. One oil stove,\n        c. One lamp,\n        d. Enough supplies of all kinds sufficient for six months,\n        e. Pots, pans, kettles, etc.\nIt is needless to say that positions in Manila and Iloilo were now at\na premium.\n\nWas it possible that teachers were to be sent to places where even the\nnecessaries of life could not be obtained! Was it possible that many\nwould be sent to places so remote that for six months no fresh\nsupplies could be gotten! A mass meeting was held at once, and a\ncommittee was appointed to send a cablegram to the Associated Press\npetitioning aid from the American people at large. Realizing what\nconsternation would be created throughout the United States by such a\nmessage, two of the teachers leaped into a carriage at the close of\nthe meeting and a few moments later were closeted with the chief\nexecutive of the department. As a result the committee was persuaded\nnot to send the cablegram to the Associated Press until by courtesy it\nhad been sent to the President. Of course, this diplomatic move tided\naffairs over and the teachers who had flatly refused to budge from\nManila now agreed to go on to their stations, being assured that\nwhatever action was best would be taken.\n\nThe day had come when we must separate. We were to enter an untried\nand an unknown field. It was fitting that we have a final joyous\nmeeting, so the best orchestra in the archipelago was engaged and we\n\"chased the hours with flying feet\" until dawn so that whatever might\ncome to us in that unknown future upon which we were entering each\nwould hold in pleasant memory our last evening together.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER III. - A DRAMA IN ACTUAL LIFE.\n\n\nAlmost every one heeded the warning to go to his station forearmed\nwith at least necessaries of life, but, as it had never fallen to the\nlot of the writer to cook, he refused to learn at that late day, so he\ntook no pot, no pan, no kettle, putting his future into the hands of\nan uncertain fate and relying upon the unknown hospitality of the\nFilipino.\n\nBacalod, the capital of the province of Occidental Negros, was our\ndestination. The second morning after leaving Manila, we awoke with\nthe \"Kilpatrick\" lying at anchor in a shallow bay. We were several\nmiles from the shore and nothing in sight indicated that we had\nreached a place of any importance. Late the night before we had been\nawakened by the loud, sharp ringing of the ship's bells, accompanied\nby the reversal of the engines and a general disturbance awaking the\ncrew. So our first impressions on coming on deck were that we had run\naground. But the captain assured us that everything was ship-shape and\nthat this was the nearest point of approach to Capiz, a town of\nconsiderable importance on the island of Panay, where a body of troops\nwas to embark for home. Not even the grass hut of a native was in\nsight. Search as we would, not a sign was seen of a stream flowing\ninto the sea, indicating the probable presence of a town. There was\nnot a sign of life of any kind save one lone column of thin, blue\nsmoke that arose from the side of a mountain miles away. One would\nhave thought that we were explorers of three hundred years ago lying\noff the shore of some unknown land.\n\nAfter breakfast the steam launch, together with all the boats, was\nlowered, and several of us who had determined to miss no opportunity\nto gather information about the islands took our places in the launch\nby the side of the ship's mate, and steamed away across the water with\na long line of boats strung out in the rear. We headed away toward a\ngroup of cocoanut trees, and about an hour later stepped ashore on a\npile of decayed coral rocks that extended some twenty or thirty feet\nout into the water, thus forming the only landing place of a town of\nseveral thousands of people and of considerable commercial importance.\n\nA few moments after we had landed, an army wagon drawn by a\nmagnificent pair of mules came up out of a tropical jungle along a\nnarrow road. We clambered into the wagon and were soon lost in the\ndepths of foliage from which we had just seen the vehicle emerge.\n\nLong waving bamboos with their plumy leafage hung over the road from\neach side, meeting and overlapping in the center until they formed an\narchway so dense that the tropical sun now high in the heavens\npenetrated it only at intervals. At times the wagon sank up to the\nhubs in the soft earth, and the muscles of the mules stood out like\nwhip-cords under the skin as they drew us forward.\n\nAt a sharp turn in the road we came upon the first division of troops\nthat was to embark for home. The look of joy upon their sun-browned\nfaces was inexpressible. Their work was done, and with elastic step\nand smiling faces they saluted us as they passed by. The reign of\nforce was at an end; it was going out with them; the reign of peace\nhad begun; it was coming in with us.\n\nIn the afternoon when we returned from the town the last of the troops\nhad arrived and, as we drove up, the bugle was sounding the call to\nsupper. We noticed native women mingling with the troops and, indeed,\na native woman was in constant attention waiting upon one of the\nsoldiers with whom we ate. Her clothes were clean, her hair was nicely\ncombed, and her general appearance was neat. She seemed to anticipate\nthe slightest wish of the soldier with whom she was. She brought him\nwater to drink, cleaned his plate after the meal and saw that his\nknife, fork, and spoon were put into his haversack.\n\nWe had now finished supper and the launch had returned for the last\nload of troops. The lieutenant in command of the company gave the\norder to \"fall in\"; the men shouldered their rifles and fell into\nline. \"Forward, march!\" called the lieutenant, and the column swept\nforward towards the boats. The women had until now restrained\nthemselves, but, as their husbands marched away never to return, their\nfeelings could no longer be restrained. One young woman of about\neighteen, who was leaning against a rock by the roadside sobbing, when\nher husband passed, leaped up in frenzy of passionate love and caught\nthe rifle from his shoulder. Her first impulse seemed to be to throw\nthe gun away, but suddenly realizing the futility of such an act she\nburst into tears, shouldered the rifle herself and marched on by his\nside. Another woman of more mature age threw her arms around the legs\nof a tall stalwart man, and drew him bodily from the line.\n\nBut the troops marched on and entered the boats. One woman who had\nbeen unnoticed before came down into the shallow water and caught hold\nof our last boat as if to prevent its leaving, while others stood\nmingling their sobs with the sounds of the wavelets as they broke on\nthe sands. As we passed away, an expectant mother, standing in bold\noutline against the twilight sky, threw up her hands in an agony of\ndespair and then sank upon the stones. The curtain had fallen upon a\ndrama in actual life deeper in pathos than any other we had ever seen\nor ever expected to see. Depth of passion, depth of love! Who can\nfathom the human heart?\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. - WHAT THE TEACHERS DID.\n\n\nThere is a remarkable sameness about the towns in the Philippines.\n\nThey all have a large open square about the middle of the town, around\nthree sides of which are Chinese stores, unless one side lies open to\nthe sea, and on the fourth is the great stone ecclesia. The streets\nrun at right angles to one another and divide up the town into\ncreditable squares.\n\nEverybody in the Philippines lives up-stairs, for the ground is so\nsoaked with water during the rainy season that it is a menace to\nhealth to live upon the ground floor. So even the poorest nippa hut\nis built upon stakes four or five feet above the ground.\n\nBacalod is a typical Philippine town. As we landed, a broad open\nsquare was spread out before us. Two sides of the square were lined\nwith two-story houses in which were Chinese stores below and Filipino\nhomes above. On the third side stood the great stone church in whose\nmassive tower the clock was striking the hour of four, while the\nfourth lay open to the sea that had borne us thither.\n\nWe landed, but it was in a method new to us and one not usually\nemployed by the traveling public.\n\nWhen our sail boat ran aground on the sandy bottom a hundred yards or\nmore from the shore, a crowd of Filipino men who were on the beach\nslowly rolled up their pantaloons and waded out to the rescue,--for\nthe money that was in it. The boat's crew elevated their trousers'\nlegs also and slided down into the water. Each of us then straddled\nthe neck of a Filipino standing in the water and was held by ankles to\nbe steadied while our biped mounts proceeded to the shore.\n\nWe were now on the ground and face to face with the situation. To give\nthe reader an idea of the actual conditions met by the first teachers\nwho went to the Islands, the following is copied from the instructions\ngiven us in Manila:\n    1. There shall be two sessions daily of all schools, and the\n    last hour of the morning session shall be devoted solely to\n    instructing the Filipino teachers.\n\n    2. In cases where teachers are sent to a town in which there\n    is no school-house, they are expected to secure the aid of the\n    people and have one built.\n\n    3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is\n    stopped.\n\n    4. All supplies must be kept under lock and key. In towns\n    where there is no case or box to lock the supplies in, and it\n    is also impossible to get the town council to furnish a case,\n    a requisition may be sent to Manila, and, if an appropriation\n    can be secured, one will be made and sent out.\n\nThus it can be easily seen that we were indeed pioneers. In many\nplaces no school-house was to be found, and in some cases it was even\ndifficult to get the town council to provide a case in which to keep\nthe supplies.\n\nThe work of the teachers was, in short; to \"make the English language\nthe basis of instruction in the public schools.\" On our arrival at\nBacalod two schools were found in progress, for some soldiers had been\ndetailed for the work here previous to our coming. One of these was\nfor boys and the other, for girls. Thus the work here had been in a\nmeasure simplified, but complications that had arisen at Talisay, one\nof the largest and richest towns on the island, demanded a change of\nteachers and the writer was assigned to the place as superintendent.\n\nHere an attempt had been made to start a school but it had failed\nignominiously and a system of education was to be put into operation\nfrom the very start.\n\nThe Filipinos are not strong advocates of co-education, so separate\nschools were to be started for the boys and the girls. The one for the\nboys was gotten well in hand before the one for the girls was\nattempted at all.\n\nA few days after reaching the town and securing a home the\npresidente of the town had it publicly announced that the following\nMonday morning at eight o'clock a public school for boys would be\nopened in a building that had been rented for the purpose by the\nmunicipal council. About the middle of the afternoon of the same day a\nman beat a little drum throughout all the streets of the town to call\nthe people out and the town clerk announced both in Spanish and in the\nnative language that this public school would begin at the time and\nplace mentioned above; that instruction would be free to all who came;\nthat the government would furnish all supplies; and that instruction\nwould be given in the English language. A native principal and\nassistants were employed and everything was ready to begin.\n\nThe official report of the result is as follows:\n    Boys' public school of Talisay, Negros, P. I., began November\n    4, 1901. Forty-three boys present at eight o'clock. Forty-one\n    of them knew \"good morning\" and \"good afternoon\" but do not\n    know the distinction between them. Two of them speak simple\n    Spanish. At eight forty-five, eight more, who had been\n    attending an early morning private school, came in together.\n\n    The books they brought were so varied and so different from\n    one another that it seemed impossible to bring any reasonable\n    degree of order out of such a chaos, and so, after struggling\n    vainly for about a week with the problem, the superintendent\n    by one fell stroke removed everything in use and put in a\n    uniform system, and from that day on the English language has\n    been the basis of instruction in the public schools of\n    Talisay. The work was of necessity very slow at first, but by\n    the end of a year two schools were going nicely and a number\n    of the brightest boys and girls had made really excellent\n    progress.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER V. - A \"BAILE.\"\n\n\nNot long after the arrival of our party at Bacalod we received an\ninvitation to a \"baile\" given in our honor by the inhabitants of\nSilay, a town some ten or twelve miles up the northern coast and one\nnoted for its social life. The invitation was accepted with pleasure,\nand about the middle of the afternoon on the day appointed we were\nclad in the immaculate white of the tropics and steaming away up the\ncoast on board a launch sent for our conveyance. Twilight was still\nlingering on the path of day when we anchored just off shore at the\ntown. A row-boat containing the officials of the city came out to meet\nus and, in due season, we were ushered into a spacious drawing-room\nfilled almost to overflowing with the \u00e9lite of the town. The \u00e9lite of\ntowns in the Philippines speak Spanish, and, as only one or two of our\nparty could at that time boast of more than a formal acquaintance with\nthe Castilian tongue, the exchange of ideas that evening between us\nand the Filipinos was of necessity not very rapid.\n\nThe necessity of easy communication between us was rendered somewhat\nless indispensable by the announcement of supper as soon as we were\nrested from our trip. When we had taken our places at the table a\nyoung Filipino about twenty-five years of age arose and gave a lengthy\ntoast to the recent union of the Philippines with the United States.\n\nBut as we Americans were unable to scale the dizzy heights of his\nclimaxes or sink to the depths of his pathos, we forewent the\npleasures of his oratory and turned our attention to the savory odor\nof lamb, chicken, and roast pig that came slyly stealing up our\nnostrils to send us nerve dispatches about the gastronomic delights of\nour not far distant future.\n\nAt last the toast was ended and the world-wide soup ushered in a long\ntrain of things good to eat, served in a style better fitted to the\ndelights of the appetite than to the formalities of dinners, for, as\nsoon as the pleasant task of one dish was completed by any one, the\nnext was served him at once regardless of the progress made by the\nothers at the table.\n\nThe last course was dulce. The new-comers to the Philippines will\nnot be long in making the acquaintance of this dish, and at all\nmeetings, both public and private, where eatables are served, it\nperforms an important part. It is anything sweet, and it may vary all\nthe way from an india-rubber-like black mixture of cocoanut milk and\ndirty sugar to a really toothsome and respectable confection. No\nmatter of what materials a dish is composed, just so long as it is\nsweet, it is dulce.\n\nAfter paying our respects to this last course, we arose from the table\nand entered a great rectangular room from the center of whose ceiling\nhung a large glass chandelier, a mass of shimmering crystals. In the\nchairs around the room were the wealth, the youth, and the beauty of\nthe town.\n\nThe first and also the last number of every Filipino dance of any\nformality is the \"rigodon.\" The dancers are arranged in a square, or\nquadrangle according to the number participating, and are then led\nthrough a tangled maze of figures that so utterly bewilders the novice\nthat he sinks into his chair at the end of the dance wondering how it\nall came to pass.\n\nWe Americans breathed a sigh of relief when the \"rigodon\" ended, and\nmustered fresh courage for social conquests in the waltz that was now\nbreathing forth from the trembling strings. My companion in the first\ndance had been the young lady by whose side I had sat at dinner. But\nit now became necessary to search for another, so I prudently waited\nto see how partners were chosen, and made no mistake when a few\nmoments later I faced one of the most luscious looking se\u00f1oritas on\nthe opposite side of the room and offered her my arm. My eyes must\nhave told the story that my lips could not utter in Spanish, for she\nsmiled upon me sweetly, arose, and put her hand upon my shoulder. My\narm encircled her waist and I began to waltz. Unfortunately my\ncompanion did not follow, but began to hop up and down in a manner\nmost distressing. Supposing the attack to be only temporary, I paused\nand, much to my relief, she soon showed signs of recovery; and in the\ncourse of time she came to a standstill looking up into my face in an\ninquiring sort of way, apparently wondering why St. Vitus had not paid\nhis respects to me also. A second attempt to follow the music met with\nresults similar to the first, and during the third attempt, which\nseemed to be trembling on the verge of a failure, St. Vitus let go my\ncompanion and seized me with such vigor that she, who was small even\nfor a Filipino, was gathered up bodily and taken around the room at\nsuch a pace that her toes touched the floor only at far distant\nintervals.\n\nAt this point my devotion to the shrine of Terpsichore ceased from\nforce of circumstances and I seated myself in one of the most\ncomfortable chairs in sight that I might carry out a previously formed\nplan to study the Filipino somewhat critically as he appears in\nsociety.\n\nThe first thing that impressed me as the dancers passed up and down\nthe room was the flash of diamonds. Nearly every woman in the room had\non a brooch that flashed the colors of the rainbow at every turn.\n\nAlmost all of them wore one or more rings that showed up brilliantly\nunder the chandelier. Many of the men too, especially the young men,\nwore gems that appeared to be exquisite. A closer inspection showed\nthat some of the gems had flaws and others were of a poor color, but\nno one would have denied that, taken as a whole, it was a really\nbeautiful display.\n\nThe dress of the ladies was richly colored. Many of their skirts were\nof silk covered with hand embroidered flowers, and their filmy pina\nwaists and broad collar pieces were rich with needle-work. They all\nwore a kind of heelless velvet slipper, very common as a dress shoe in\nthe Philippines, or high-heeled patent leather shoes with neatly\nfitting black stockings.\n\nThe men were dressed in white coats and white pantaloons or black\ncoats and white pantaloons. White shirts and collars, together with\nall sorts and styles of cravats and low-cut patent leather shoes with\nhighly colored socks completed their dress.\n\nIt was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money;\nthat they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a\ntable loaded with good things was a fact to which all of us were\nenthusiastic witnesses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VI. - A SKETCH OF LIFE IN THE PHILIPPINES.\n\n\nHouse-keeping in the Philippines presents some interesting phases. Our\nclub of American officials decided to run a mess, so we employed a\ncook and a house boy, then each of us provided himself with a personal\nservant, making a total of six servants for four men--it takes about\nthis proportion of servants to live in any sort of comfort in the\nPhilippines--and launched ourselves boldly upon the sea of domestic\neconomy. But there were shoals ahead of us, for the question of\nregulating servants is one of no small importance in the Philippines,\nand one of its most disadvantageous features is the long chain of\ndependents that usually attends it.\n\nWe gave the cooks so much a day with which to buy supplies in the\nlocal market, for our own table, making him render a daily list of\nexpenditures, and a fixed amount besides to purchase rice and fish for\nhimself and the other servants. Of course, if they wished to vary\ntheir diet and get chicken and fresh pork, which could be had at far\ndistant intervals, it was wholly a matter of their option, but the\nallowance was made on the basis of so much rice and fish a day for\neach. This allowance was about fifteen cents a day in Spanish coin per\nservant.\n\nThus far all was well. We had agreed to give the cook eight dollars a\nmonth in Spanish money, thinking that good wages would procure good\nservice, but the visions of affluence that floated before him on such\nfloods of wealth were so alluring that they drew him from the kitchen\nto the cooler veranda. In less than a week he had employed an\nassistant at four dollars a month; in less than another week that\nassistant had employed him an assistant at two dollars a month; in\nless than another week that assistant to the assistant had employed\nhim an assistant at the princely salary of fifty cents a month; and\nfrom fear that the chain of dependents would end only by our having\nthe whole Filipino race attached to our culinary force, we broke up\nhouse-keeping and went boarding again, choosing that as the less of\nthe two evils.\n\nOur house furnishings were almost wholly Philippine. The table ware\nand the food on the table came from the ends of the earth. The knives\nand forks were made in Germany, the plates were manufactured in\nEngland, the glass ware and table cloth, in the United States. The\noatmeal and flour came from the United States also. The butter came\nfrom Australia, the rice from China, the salt from Russia, and the\nother eatables from sources about as various as their separate names.\n\nSwitzerland furnished the condensed milk and Illinois the canned\ncream. Nearly all of the canned fruit bore labels from Spain.\n\nThus it can easily be seen that life in the Philippines, if lived\naccording to American ideals, is dependent upon a highly developed and\nhighly complex commerce. However, the difficulties of transportation\nand the restriction of large stocks of merchandise to Manila and some\nhalf a dozen other towns, make so great a difference between country\nlife and city life that a short comparison of the two will not be out\nof place, and life in Manila may well be taken as being fairly typical\nof the latter.\n\nLife in Manila is pleasant, but expensive. It is pleasant from the\nfact that it is not only the capital but also metropolis of the\narchipelago. Thus the combination of wealth and high official position\nhas given to Manila a society of the highest and most refined type.\n\nThe process of beautifying and improving the city which is constantly\ngoing on bids fair to give us at no distant day a city of which we may\nwell be proud.\n\nBut let him who intends living well in Manila on a small income bid\nfarewell at once to so idylic a dream, for it costs much to live well\nthere. In the city of Manila one can get almost anything he wishes,\nbut it must be paid for at the price it commands. Especially in the\ncase of eatables, this price is by no means small, because to the\nfirst cost of articles must in most cases be added the expense of\ndistant shipment from American, European, or Australian ports, and not\ninfrequently the cost of long refrigeration must also be taken into\nconsideration. But, expensive though it is, it is very pleasant to\nlive there and those who have once enjoyed it often wish again to\nquaff the cup of its delights.\n\nIn strong contrast to this pleasant life is the life of the quiet\nlittle hamlet away in the distant islands. Indeed, the Filipino from\nthe distant town, who by some good fortune has been to Manila, or, by\na coup de main, has studied in one of the Manila colleges, is looked\nup to in a true hero-worshiping attitude by all who either know him or\nhear of his fame. Life in such a place is one long state of harmless\ninactivity. Not a wave of trouble from the great outer world ever\ndisturbs its peaceful repose. One lounges forever in an air of\nindolent ease and extreme aversion to anything approaching what might\nbe called a respectable effort.\n\nOne arises in the morning about the time the sun's first rays silver\nthe top leaves of the cocoanut trees and then stirs around until nine\nor ten o'clock, when it is found expedient to avoid a further exposure\nto the sun. From then until about five o'clock in the afternoon it is\nbest to take things as they come, even though one of those things be a\nFilipino dinner. But then you may have your vehiclo attached to a\nyoung bull with a ring in his nose and go for a drive. If it is the\ndry season you will probably enjoy the drive unless you object to the\nfrequent clouds of dust swept along by the evening wind. If it is in\nthe rainy season your pleasure will depend to a considerable extent\nupon how wet you get; but, whether the season be wet or dry, your\npleasure will be regulated largely by the state of harmony existing\nbetween the driver and the bull.\n\nIn these quiet secluded nooks successive generations of Filipinos are\nborn, reared, grow old and die in an even chain of events broken only\nby the occasional erection of a new grass house on the identical spot\nwhere its predecessors have stood for ages. The son lives in the house\nof his father, cultivates the same few square feet of soil planted in\nedible roots, climbs the same cocoanut trees, follows the same winding\npath down to the stream, pounds rice in the same mortar and with the\nsame stick that his ancestors have used from time unremembered, and,\nin case of illness, curls up on a grass mat in a corner of the room\nuntil he dies or by some good fortune recovers. Beyond this narrow\nhorizon he never looks. So narrow and contracted is the life that the\nlanguages of two towns a few miles apart are so different that one\nwould scarcely recognize them as belonging to the same race of people.\n\nSuch are the two extremes of life in our new far Eastern provinces:\nthe one is active, progressive, and cosmopolitan; the other, inactive,\ndecadent, and narrow; but, whether one enjoys the first or endures the\nsecond, there comes to him after leaving a longing to lounge again in\ntropic airs and listen to the lullaby of the winds among the palms.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VII. - THE FILIPINO AT HOME.\n\n\nAs one enters a Filipino sitting-room for the first time, there is one\nfeature in the arrangement of the furniture that impresses itself upon\nhim at once, and it may be stated without fear of serious\ncontradiction that this same peculiar feature in its arrangement will\ncontinue to face him, as he enters different homes, about as certainly\nas he crosses the threshold.\n\nThe arrangement referred to is that of one large mirror, one settee,\nand some ten or a dozen chairs that appear to have had a certain\norderly affection for one another. The mirror is hung upon one of the\nlarge interior parts of the house about four feet above the floor. The\nwooden houses in the Philippines are built by setting large posts\nupright into the ground, extending into the air from twenty to thirty\nfeet. Cross timbers are fastened to these upright posts about eight or\nten feet above the ground and then not sawed off even with the posts,\nbut allowed to extend beyond them each way. The framework of the house\nis built upon these extending cross timbers, a style of building by\nwhich these large upright posts are left standing out on the inside of\nthe room from one to three feet from the walls. It is on that one of\nthese posts most nearly opposite the door that the mirror always finds\nits place. Immediately beneath the mirror is the settee; and the\nchairs are arranged in two parallel lines facing one another and at\nright angles with the ends of the settee. However odd this arrangement\nmay appear to one when he first enters a Filipino drawing-room, there\nare two things to be said in its favor. In the first place, it places\nyou face to face with the person with whom you are conversing so that\nyou can watch him,--a matter of no small moment in the Philippines. In\nthe next place, it enables you to give one of the young ladies a\nsheep's-eye in the mirror while the others present are left where\nMoses was in our much abused conundrum.\n\nThe size of the residence and the quality of its furnishings depends\nupon the wealth of the owner. But there is so vast a difference\nbetween the mode of life of the highest class and the tao, or lowest\nclass, that it is well to speak of them separately, and the great\nmiddle class of Filipinos can easily be imagined to occupy the\nintervening ground.\n\nThe rich Filipino's house is usually of wood built upon a wall of\nstone or brick from ten to fifteen feet high. The floors are kept\nhighly polished in his hallway, dressing-room, and bed-rooms. There\nare, of course, no fire-places in any of the rooms, but on some\noccasions something is needed to dry the rain-soaked atmosphere, for\neven in the dry season it has been seen to rain for five successive\ndays and nights without the cessation of a moment.\n\nA long chain of dependents is attached to the household of the rich\nFilipino. The master has his special body servant to be present at all\ntimes to do his master's bidding, in short, to be the visible\nmechanism of his master's volition. So, too, the lady of the house has\nher servant woman to do the slightest bidding of her ladyship. Then\nthere is the cook who is almost invariably a man, a house boy or two,\nand the coachman. These functionaries, with their assistants and\nassistants to the assistants, together with a servant or two for the\nexclusive service of the children, complete the economic household.\n\nSuch a family has an abundance of rice and wheat bread, also of\nchicken and fish with occasional fresh beef. They have also a good\ndeal of dulce. They regularly serve wine and frequently serve beer\non their tables.\n\nIn strong contrast with this mode of life is that of the tao. His\ndiet consists almost wholly of rice and small uncleaned fish boiled\ntogether. As a rule knife, fork, plate, and spoon find no place in his\nhousehold. The rice and fish are boiled in a pot and then allowed to\ncool in the same vessel or poured out to cool in a large earthen or\nwooden bowl. Then Mr. Tao together with Mrs. Tao and all the young\nTaos squat on their heels around the mixture and satisfy that\nintangible thing called the appetite. They do not use chop sticks as\nthe Chinese do, but the rice and fish are caught in a hollow formed by\nthe first three fingers of the right hand. The thumb is then placed\nbehind the mass. It is raised up and poised before the mouth, with a\nskill coming from the evolution of ages, when a contraction of the\nmuscles of the thumb throws the mass into the mouth with a skill that\nis marvelous to any but a Filipino. To judge from the most reliable\ninformation, the poorest class do not have an abundance of food,\nalthough it would seem that such a condition of things would be\nwell-nigh impossible. However, in a census of one hundred school\nchildren there were found six boys and four girls who declared that\nthey had never had enough to eat, and the native teacher stated that\nthis was probably true.\n\nThe wide gulf between the tao and the rich man is filled by the\ngreat middle class of Filipinos.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VIII. - VISIT TO A LEPER COLONY.\n\n\nNot far from our town was a leper colony and the first Saturday that\ncould be spared was set aside for a trip to the place. It happened\nthat none of the other Americans were at leisure on this particular\nmorning, but, rather then delay the trip or miss it altogether, the\nwriter, armed with a revolver, started out alone.\n\nThe road had been described so accurately by one who was supposed to\nknow it that it was deemed well-nigh impossible to miss the way. The\nmain highway was followed to the point where the by-path supposed to\nlead to the settlement turned off through some bamboo thickets and a\nlow tropical wood. This path led straight away towards the sea-coast\nwhere the houses of the colony were said to stand in a cocoanut grove\nby the beach.\n\nUpon arriving at the settlement, a very inhospitable reception was\nreceived from a mangy cur that growled and showed a very uninviting\nset of sharp, white teeth behind his snarling lips. The growling of\nthe dog had attracted the attention of an old man who, with age-bent\nback, was pounding rice in a mortar about fifty yards away. He turned\nslowly around and, upon seeing an intruder into the primitive quiet of\nthe place, gave a sharp, far-reaching call. The sound had scarcely\nrung through the grove when from about a dozen of the little grass\nhouses dotted here and there fifteen or twenty men armed with bolos\ncame out and gathered around the old man. A sense of my danger flashed\nupon me. Three miles from town and alone in a tropical jungle, I could\nbe almost instantly overcome by this band of bolo-men, and the only\nreport that would ever reach my people would be that I had\n\"disappeared.\" Of course, attack was by no means certain, but the\npotentiality of the situation was thrilling. A drawn revolver and the\ngleaming of its shining barrel had the effect of stopping the men, who\nseemed to be hesitating as to a course of action, until a somewhat\ndignified retreat was made to an open space in the rear from where a\nless dignified and a more hasty retreat began which did not stop short\nof Bacalod.\n\nEnough had been seen, however, even in this short visit, to give\nconvincing proof that the settlement visited was no colony of lepers;\nso, that afternoon two servant boys being taken as guides and\ninterpreters, another attempt was made to reach the goal desired.\n\nThis attempt was successful, and, after about two hours of walking, a\nlittle cluster of grass huts snugly hidden by the sea-coast came into\nview. As we approached, one would have thought it a gala-day. Some few\nchildren, apparently from six to thirteen years of age, almost wholly\nnude, were romping and playing in the open space around which the huts\nstood, and no one would ever have thought that any cloud so horrible\nas leprosy could hover over a place apparently so happy.\n\nBy the side of the path as we passed was a man and his wife setting\nout potato plants. His hands were so puffed and his fingers so short\nthat he could scarcely use them, but he was working along as best he\ncould. His wife's feet were so swollen and twisted that she walked\nonly with the greatest difficulty. We passed them by and entered the\nopen space above referred to.\n\nThe children now saw us, and those of them who could darted away like\nfrightened rabbits, each to his own burrow. An old man who was sitting\nin the warm afternoon sun on the little bamboo platform before his hut\nwas aroused from his lethargic repose by the scampering away of the\nchildren. He arose, trembling upon his tottering limbs, all drawn and\ntwisted, and hobbled away into his hut.\n\nThe children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at\nthe doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of\nthe settlement. In a few moments we were surrounded by a circle of\nhuman beings at once so repulsive and so pitiable that its graphic\nvividness can never be accurately portrayed.\n\nThe old man referred to above, having put on a pair of snow-white\npantaloons, appeared now at the doorway of his hut, followed a few\nmoments later by his wife who had evidently clothed herself in the\nbest raiment she had. At a call from the old man, all the men, women,\nand children in the settlement came out of their huts and stood in a\nline before us. The old man was spokesman and in his native visayan\ntongue made a heart-rending appeal for aid which we were powerless to\ngive. Attention was called to a leper woman, apparently about\ntwenty-five years of age, whose face had been attacked by the disease\nand whose appearance was truly pathetic. Upon her hip was a child\nabout a year and a half old and, strange to say, the child showed as\nyet no signs whatever of the disease.\n\nWhat an indissoluble enigma is life! Here in a little cluster of grass\nhuts in a secluded nook of a secluded island of an all but secluded\narchipelago was gathered together a little community of wretched\nnatives, driven by their loathsomeness from association with others\neven of the same half-savage race. Yet here, men and women loved and\nwere married, by mutual trust if not by law, and children were born of\nthe union to live forever under the unspeakable horror that\novershadowed the unfortunate parents. Love, hatred, sorrow, and\njoy--every passion that enters into the complex structure of the human\nheart even here, in this scene of sadness and despair, was playing\napparently as freely as where misfortune and disease had never crossed\nthe portals of life.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER IX. - A \"HIKE.\"\n\n\nWe were lounging lazily in our hammocks at Jimamaylan one evening in\nApril. Supper was just ended, and the soldiers in the post were\ncollected in groups here and there spinning yarns to pass away the\ntime, when a Filipino clad only in a loin cloth came down the street\nat a steadily swinging run and stopped in front of the sentry. He\nbrought the announcement that a band of ladrones had just burned a\nsugar mill and were advancing to sack a barrio about fifteen miles\naway.\n\nThe invitation of the commanding officer to go on a \"hike\" was eagerly\naccepted, and, in ten minutes after the message was given, the troops\nwere on the march followed by two adventurous pedagogues.\n\nDarkness was just closing in as we left the town, but a resplendent\ntropic moon soon made the night almost as brilliant as the day. The\ntrail we followed led over rough and rocky country. Sometimes for a\ndistance of a mile or more we passed over barren wastes of volcanic\nslag poured out in anger by some peak whose convulsions have long\nsince ceased. Again we would descend into a tropical jungle from the\ndense foliage of which the ladrones could have leaped at any moment,\nhad they known of our coming, and annihilated our little band. We\nforded rapid streams with the water at our breasts, and halted only\nonce in that rapid march of fifteen miles.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the town we met a man who was standing\nguard against a surprise by the ladrones. Nothing could well have been\nmuch more grotesque and nothing could much better illustrate the\nabsolutely primitive condition of the Filipinos in the interior of the\nislands than the appearance of this guard. A pair of knee pants, a\nconical grass hat, and a hemp shirt formed his entire apparel. A long\nflat wooden shield, a bolo, and a long bamboo spear with a sharp,\nflat, iron point, completed his equipment for battle.\n\nHere stood the first and the twentieth centuries side by side. The\nFilipino who had advanced only a stage beyond the condition of\nprimitive man with his knife, spear, and wooden shield, stood side by\nside with the American soldier, a representative of modern life with\nhis magazine rifle, his canteen, his knapsack,--with every article of\nhis clothing made to give him the highest possible efficiency as the\nunit of a military organization.\n\nA few yards farther on we met another guard equipped similarly to the\nfirst. Upon reaching the town, news had just been received that a\ndetachment of troops from another post had intercepted the ladrones\nand fought a skirmish with them. The ladrones had escaped and we set\nout in pursuit of them on a chase wilder than a Quixotic dream. We\nwound our way into the mountains behind the town, inquiring at every\ngrass hut we passed whether the band of ladrones had passed that way,\nbut only once was even a trace of them found. Then it was learned that\nat a certain place they had separated into groups of three or four and\ngone glimmering through the dream of things that were. This place was\nin a secluded nook of the mountains where in years gone by some\nadventurous Spaniard had erected a primitive water mill to grind his\nsugar-cane. We had now marched about twenty miles and the feet of the\npedagogues were a mass of blisters. They had reached the point where\nthat form of military maneuvering called \"hiking\" ceased to possess\nany alluring charms. So a native was persuaded to come out of his lone\nmountain hut and hitch up his carabao and cart. He was then made to\nget on the carabao's back, while the aforesaid pedagogues lay down on\nthe sugar-cane pulp that had been put into the body of the cart, and\nthe driver was instructed to start for the post we had left hours\nbefore, and not to stop until he got there. Being uncertain but that\nsome of the ladrones would learn of our having left the body of troops\nand would try the metal of our steel, we at first agreed that neither\nof us should go to sleep, but it was later decided that probably the\ndriver had no greater desire to cross the Styx than his passengers had\nand that in case of danger he would awaken us, so both took a revolver\nin each hand, stretched out supinely and went to sleep.\n\nSuch a sleep! The rough jolting of the cart over an almost impassable\nroad was never enough to break the spell of slumber. When we awoke the\nblazing tropic sun was past the midday mark of morning, shining full\ninto our unprotected and well-nigh blistered faces.\n\nA pack of dogs were heralding our approach to a little village at the\nfoot of the mountains where ponies were procured to take us back to\nthe post."

                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently\nno time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth dimension of Space\nas a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house\nbecame quite quiet.\n\nOn reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up\nagainst a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realize\nhis position. Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\nhundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the\nDowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone\ninto hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains on\none of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who\nhad been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr\nto nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair\nby the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six\nweeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become\nreconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that\nnotorious sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible\nnight when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his\ndressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and\nconfessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox\nout of \u00a350,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card, and swore that\nthe ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back\nto him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because\nhe had seen a green hand tapping at the window-pane, to the beautiful\nLady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round\nher throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin,\nand who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of the\nKing's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he went\nover his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as\nhe recalled to mind his last appearance as \"Red Reuben, or the Strangled\nBabe,\" his d\u00e9but as \"Guant Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,\"\n\nand the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely\nplaying ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And\nafter all this some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him\nthe Rising Sun Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite\nunbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever been treated in this\nmanner. Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance, and remained till\ndaylight in an attitude of deep thought.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III\n\n\nThe next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed\nthe ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. \"I have\nno wish,\" he said, \"to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say\nthat, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,\"--a very just remark,\nat which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.\n\n\"Upon the other hand,\" he continued, \"if he really declines to use the\nRising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him. It\nwould be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside\nthe bedrooms.\"\n\nFor the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the\nblood-stain on the library floor. This certainly was very strange, as\nthe door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept\nclosely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a\ngood deal of comment. Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red,\nthen it would be vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came\ndown for family prayers, according to the simple rites of the Free\nAmerican Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright\nemerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party\nvery much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening. The\nonly person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia, who,\nfor some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the\nsight of the blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was\nemerald-green.\n\nThe second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in\nthe hall. Rushing down-stairs, they found that a large suit of old\narmour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone\nfloor, while seated in a high-backed chair was the Canterville ghost,\nrubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face. The\ntwins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged\ntwo pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained\nby long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United\nStates Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in\naccordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost\nstarted up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a\nmist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so\nleaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase\nhe recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of\ndemoniac laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely\nuseful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single\nnight, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French\ngovernesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly\nlaughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and\nrang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door\nopened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown. \"I am\nafraid you are far from well,\" she said, \"and have brought you a bottle\nof Doctor Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a\nmost excellent remedy.\" The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at\nonce to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an\naccomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family\ndoctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's\nuncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps,\nhowever, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself\nwith becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep\nchurchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.\n\nOn reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the\nmost violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross\nmaterialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what\nreally distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit\nof mail. He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by\nthe sight of a Spectre in armour, if for no more sensible reason, at\nleast out of respect for their natural poet Longfellow, over whose\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\nhour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides it was his own suit.\n\nHe had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament, and had\nbeen highly complimented on it by no less a person than the Virgin Queen\nherself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely overpowered\nby the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen\nheavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees severely, and\nbruising the knuckles of his right hand.\n\nFor some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of\nhis room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.\n\nHowever, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to\nmake a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his\nfamily. He selected Friday, August 17th, for his appearance, and spent\nmost of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in\nfavour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet\nfrilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards evening a\nviolent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was\njust such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to\nmake his way quietly to Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the\nfoot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\nof low music. He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville\nblood-stain by means of Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent. Having reduced\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and\nhis wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead,\nwhile he hissed into her trembling husband's ear the awful secrets of\nthe charnel-house. With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made\nup his mind. She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and\ngentle. A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more\nthan sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the\ncounterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins, he was quite\ndetermined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be done was, of\ncourse, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling\nsensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each\nother, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse,\ntill they became paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw off the\nwinding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white, bleached bones and\none rolling eyeball, in the character of \"Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's\nSkeleton,\" a r\u00f4le in which he had on more than one occasion produced a\ngreat effect, and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of\n\"Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.\"\n\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the\nlight-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves\nbefore they retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still,\nand, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the\nwindow-panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family\nslept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\ncould hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States. He\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his\nmurdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like\nan evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.\n\nOnce he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only\nthe baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange\nsixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\nin the midnight air. Finally he reached the corner of the passage that\nled to luckless Washington's room. For a moment he paused there, the\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's\nshroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was\ncome. He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had\nhe done so than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid\nhis blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was\nstanding a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous\nas a madman's dream! Its head was bald and burnished; its face round,\nand fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\nfeatures into an eternal grin. From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\nlight, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like\nto his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form. On its breast\nwas a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of\nshame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime,\nand, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\n\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's\njack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler. Once in the\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small\npallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes. After a time, however,\nthe brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to\ngo and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight. Accordingly,\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling\nthat, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid\nof his new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins. On reaching\nthe spot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had\nevidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from\nits hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it\nwas leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable\nattitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his\nhorror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a\nrecumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity\nbed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow\nturnip lying at his feet! Unable to understand this curious\ntransformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there,\nin the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:--\n        +------------------------------------+\n        |         YE OTIS GHOSTE             |\n        | Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook, |\n        |    Beware of Ye Imitationes.       |\n        |   All others are counterfeite.     |\n        +------------------------------------+\nThe whole thing flashed across him. He had been tricked, foiled, and\nout-witted! The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his\ntoothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his\nhead, swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\nschool, that, when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds\nof blood would be wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.\n\nHardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of\na distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh,\nand waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\nreason, did not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back\nto his room, thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose. There he\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was\nexceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which this oath\nhad been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second time. \"Perdition\nseize the naughty fowl,\" he muttered, \"I have seen the day when, with my\nstout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow\nfor me an 'twere in death!\" He then retired to a comfortable lead\ncoffin, and stayed there till evening.\n\n\nCHAPTER: IV\n\n\nThe next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were\ncompletely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five\ndays he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point\nof the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want\nit, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a\nlow, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating\nthe symbolic value of sensuous phenomena. The question of phantasmic\napparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a\ndifferent matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large\noriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every month, and he\ndid not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is\nquite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand,\nhe was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.\n\nFor the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as\nusual between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible\nprecaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots,\ntrod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large\nblack velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for\noiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good\ndeal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of\nprotection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he\nslipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a\nlittle humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see\nthat there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a\ncertain degree, it served his purpose. Still in spite of everything he\nwas not left unmolested. Strings were continually being stretched across\nthe corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion,\nwhile dressed for the part of \"Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley\nWoods,\" he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide,\nwhich the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry\nChamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged\nhim, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and\nsocial position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the\nnext night in his celebrated character of \"Reckless Rupert, or the\nHeadless Earl.\"\n\nHe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in\nfact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means\nof it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord\nCanterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome\nJack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\ndown the terrace at twilight. Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\nLord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken\nheart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it\nhad been a great success. It was, however an extremely difficult\n\"make-up,\" if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more\nscientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three\nhours to make his preparations. At last everything was ready, and he was\nvery pleased with his appearance. The big leather riding-boots that went\nwith the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\nfind one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite\nsatisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting\nand crept down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins,\nwhich I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of\nthe colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make\nan effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water\nfell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his\nleft shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed. The shock to his\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\ncould go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold. The only\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\nhad not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences\nmight have been very serious.\n\nHe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,\nand contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in\nlist slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\ndraughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the\ntwins. The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September. He\nhad gone down-stairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that\nthere, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing\nhimself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of\nthe United States Minister and his wife which had now taken the place of\nthe Canterville family pictures. He was simply but neatly clad in a long\nshroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip\nof yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In\nfact, he was dressed for the character of \"Jonas the Graveless, or the\nCorpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,\" one of his most remarkable\nimpersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to\nremember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their\nneighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a quarter-past two o'clock in\nthe morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring. As\nhe was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any\ntraces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a\ndark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads,\nand shrieked out \"BOO!\" in his ear.\n\nSeized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural,\nhe rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him\nthere with the big garden-syringe, and being thus hemmed in by his\nenemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the\ngreat iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to\nmake his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own\nroom in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.\n\nAfter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins\nlay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\nservants, but it was of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings\nwere so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed\nhis great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had\nbeen engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized a wonderful\nclam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse\neuchre, poker, and other American national games, and Virginia rode\nabout the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire,\nwho had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville\nChase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in\nfact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who,\nin reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best\ncongratulations to the Minister's worthy wife.\n\nThe Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the\nhouse, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let\nmatters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the\nyoung Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had\nonce bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice\nwith the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the\nfloor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state that, though\nhe lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but\n\"Double Sixes.\" The story was well known at the time, though, of course,\nout of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt\nwas made to hush it up, and a full account of all the circumstances\nconnected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle's\nRecollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends. The ghost, then,\nwas naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence\nover the Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his\nown first cousin having been married en secondes noces to the Sieur de\nBulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are\nlineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to\nVirginia's little lover in his celebrated impersonation of \"The Vampire\nMonk, or the Bloodless Benedictine,\" a performance so horrible that when\nold Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in\nthe year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which\nculminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after\ndisinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and\nleaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment,\nhowever, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the\nlittle Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal\nBedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.\n\n\nCHAPTER: V\n\n\nA few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out\nriding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting\nthrough a hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go\nup by the back staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past\nthe Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied\nshe saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother's maid, who\nsometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend\nher habit. To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville\nGhost himself! He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of\nthe yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing\nmadly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his hand, and his\nwhole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so forlorn, and so\nmuch out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea\nhad been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity,\nand determined to try and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so\ndeep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she\nspoke to him.\n\n\"I am so sorry for you,\" she said, \"but my brothers are going back to\nEton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy\nyou.\"\n\n\"It is absurd asking me to behave myself,\" he answered, looking round in\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,\n\"quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and\nwalk about at night, if that is what you mean. It is my only reason for\nexisting.\"\n\n\"It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very\nwicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had\nkilled your wife.\"\n\n\"Well, I quite admit it,\" said the Ghost, petulantly, \"but it was a\npurely family matter, and concerned no one else.\"\n\n\"It is very wrong to kill any one,\" said Virginia, who at times had a\nsweet puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.\n\n\"Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very\nplain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about\ncookery. Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent\npricket, and do you know how she had it sent to table? However, it is\nno matter now, for it is all over, and I don't think it was very nice of\nher brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.\"\n\n\"Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost--I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry? I\nhave a sandwich in my case. Would you like it?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you,\nall the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\nvulgar, dishonest family.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Virginia, stamping her foot, \"it is you who are rude, and\nhorrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the\npaints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain\nin the library. First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and\nI couldn't do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the\nchrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese\nwhite, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing\nto look at, and not at all easy to paint. I never told on you, though I\nwas very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for\nwho ever heard of emerald-green blood?\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" said the Ghost, rather meekly, \"what was I to do? It is\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother\nbegan it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I\nshould not have your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of\ntaste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest\nin England; but I know you Americans don't care for things of this\nkind.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\nand improve your mind. My father will be only too happy to give you a\nfree passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind,\nthere will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are\nall Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\nhave a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family ghost.\"\n\n\"I don't think I should like America.\"\n\n\"I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,\" said Virginia,\nsatirically.\n\n\"No ruins! no curiosities!\" answered the Ghost; \"you have your navy and\nyour manners.\"\n\n\"Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week's\nholiday.\"\n\n\"Please don't go, Miss Virginia,\" he cried; \"I am so lonely and so\nunhappy, and I really don't know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I\ncannot.\"\n\n\"That's quite absurd! You have merely to go to bed and blow out the\ncandle. It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\nchurch, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why, even\nbabies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.\"\n\n\"I have not slept for three hundred years,\" he said sadly, and\nVirginia's beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; \"for three hundred\nyears I have not slept, and I am so tired.\"\n\nVirginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like\nrose-leaves. She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked\nup into his old withered face.\n\n\"Poor, poor Ghost,\" she murmured; \"have you no place where you can\nsleep?\"\n\n\"Far away beyond the pine-woods,\" he answered, in a low, dreamy voice,\n\"there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\nsings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold crystal\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\nsleepers.\"\n\nVirginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\n\n\"You mean the Garden of Death,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth,\nwith the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have\nno yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at\npeace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of death's\nhouse, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death\nis.\"\n\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\nthere was silence. She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\n\nThen the ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of\nthe wind.\n\n\"Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?\"\n\n\"Oh, often,\" cried the little girl, looking up; \"I know it quite well.\n\nIt is painted in curious black letters, and is difficult to read. There\nare only six lines:\n    \"'When a golden girl can win\n    Prayer from out the lips of sin,\n    When the barren almond bears,\n    And a little child gives away its tears,\n    Then shall all the house be still\n    And peace come to Canterville.'\n\n\"But I don't know what they mean.\"\n\n\"They mean,\" he said, sadly, \"that you must weep with me for my sins,\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle,\nthe angel of death will have mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\ncannot prevail.\"\n\nVirginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair\nas he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes. \"I am not afraid,\" she said\nfirmly, \"and I will ask the angel to have mercy on you.\"\n\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as\nhe led her across the dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were\nbroidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back. \"Go back! little Virginia,\"\n\nthey cried, \"go back!\" but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly,\nand she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails\nand goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and\nmurmured, \"Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,\"\n\nbut the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When\nthey reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she\ncould not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly\nfading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A\nbitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her\ndress. \"Quick, quick,\" cried the Ghost, \"or it will be too late,\" and\nin a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry\nChamber was empty.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VI\n\n\nAbout ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not\ncome down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia\nanywhere. As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\nevening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all\nalarmed at first, but when six o'clock struck, and Virginia did not\nappear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for\nher, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house. At\nhalf-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\nof their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of\nexcitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly\nremembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies\npermission to camp in the park. He accordingly at once set off for\nBlackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son\nand two of the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire, who was\nperfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too,\nbut Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a\nscuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gipsies had\ngone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as\nthe fire was still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.\n\nHaving sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran\nhome, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the\ncounty, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been\nkidnapped by tramps or gipsies. He then ordered his horse to be brought\nround, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down\nto dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with a groom. He had hardly,\nhowever, gone a couple of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after\nhim, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with\nhis face very flushed, and no hat. \"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,\" gasped\nout the boy, \"but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.\n\nPlease don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year,\nthere would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me back,\nwill you? I can't go! I won't go!\"\n\nThe Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace,\nand was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down\nfrom his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, \"Well,\nCecil, if you won't go back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must\nget you a hat at Ascot.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!\" cried the little Duke, laughing,\nand they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of\nthe station-master if any one answering to the description of Virginia\nhad been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her. The\nstation-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him\nthat a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a\nhat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his\nshutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away,\nwhich he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as there was a\nlarge common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman, but\ncould get no information from him, and, after riding all over the\ncommon, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase\nabout eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found\nWashington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with\nlanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest trace of\nVirginia had been discovered. The gipsies had been caught on Brockley\nmeadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they should be late. Indeed, they had\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's disappearance, as they\nwere very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his\npark, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search.\n\nThe carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone\nover, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any\nrate, Virginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest\ndepression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they\nfound a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\nwas poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and\nhaving her forehead bathed with eau de cologne by the old housekeeper.\n\nMr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up\nsupper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one\nspoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very\nfond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the\nentreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that\nnothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in\nthe morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down\nimmediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight\nbegan to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded\nthey heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder\nshook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a\npanel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out\non the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her\nhand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs.\nOtis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with\nviolent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.\n\n\"Good heavens! child, where have you been?\" said Mr. Otis, rather\nangrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them.\n\n\"Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and\nyour mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these\npractical jokes any more.\"\n\n\"Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!\" shrieked the twins, as they\ncapered about.\n\n\"My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side\nagain,\" murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair.\n\n\"Papa,\" said Virginia, quietly, \"I have been with the Ghost. He is dead,\nand you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was\nreally sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of\nbeautiful jewels before he died.\"\n\nThe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave\nand serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a\nlighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they\ncame to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia\ntouched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves\nin a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated\nwindow. Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was\na gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone\nfloor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers\nan old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its\nreach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was\ncovered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but\na pile of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding\nher little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the\nparty looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\ndisclosed to them.\n\n\"Hallo!\" suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out\nof the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\nsituated. \"Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.\"\n\n\"God has forgiven him,\" said Virginia, gravely, as she rose to her feet,\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.\n\n\"What an angel you are!\" cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round\nher neck, and kissed her.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VII\n\n\nFour days after these curious incidents, a funeral started from\nCanterville Chase at about eleven o'clock at night. The hearse was drawn\nby eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\nnodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\npurple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville\ncoat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\nservants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully\nimpressive. Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up\nspecially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first\ncarriage along with little Virginia. Then came the United States\nMinister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the\nlast carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had\nbeen frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she\nhad a right to see the last of him. A deep grave had been dug in the\ncorner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service\nwas read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, the servants, according to an old custom\nobserved in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as\nthe coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward,\nand laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms. As\nshe did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its\nsilent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a\nnightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of the\nGarden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a\nword during the drive home.\n\nThe next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given\nto Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby\nnecklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen\nof sixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis\nfelt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"I know that in this country mortmain is held to\napply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that\nthese jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg\nyou, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you\nunder certain strange conditions. As for my daughter, she is merely a\nchild, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such\nappurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I\nmay say, is no mean authority upon Art,--having had the privilege of\nspending several winters in Boston when she was a girl,--that these gems\nare of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\nprice. Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you\nwill recognize how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\nin the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such\nvain gauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\nBritish aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who\nhave been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles\nof Republican simplicity. Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box, as a memento of\nyour unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is extremely old, and\nconsequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to\ncomply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good deal\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with medi\u00e6valism\nin any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was\nborn in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned\nfrom a trip to Athens.\"\n\nLord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister's speech,\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile,\nand when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\nsaid: \"My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky\nancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are\nmuch indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck. The jewels\nare clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough\nto take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave\nin a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. As for their being\nheirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or\nlegal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite\nunknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and\nwhen Miss Virginia grows up, I dare say she will be pleased to have\npretty things to wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the\nfurniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to\nthe ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity\nSir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he\nwas really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase.\"\n\nMr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville's refusal, and\nbegged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was\nquite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to\nretain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of\n1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's first\ndrawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the\nuniversal theme of admiration. For Virginia received the coronet, which\nis the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her\nboy-lover as soon as he came of age. They were both so charming, and\nthey loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the\nmatch, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch\nthe Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less\nthan three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to\nsay, Mr. Otis himself. Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke\npersonally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his\nown words, \"was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating\ninfluences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of\nRepublican simplicity should be forgotten.\" His objections, however,\nwere completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the\naisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his\narm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of\nEngland.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to\nCanterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over\nin the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods. There had\nbeen a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir\nSimon's tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it\nsimply the initials of the old gentleman's name, and the verse from the\nlibrary window. The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses,\nwhich she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for\nsome time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There\nthe Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her\nfeet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly\nhe threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her,\n\"Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.\"\n\n\"Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have,\" he answered, smiling, \"you have never told me what\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.\"\n\n\"I have never told any one, Cecil,\" said Virginia, gravely.\n\n\"I know that, but you might tell me.\"\n\n\"Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you. Poor Sir Simon! I owe\nhim a great deal. Yes, don't laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see\nwhat Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than\nboth.\"\n\nThe Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.\n\n\"You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,\" he murmured.\n\n\"You have always had that, Cecil.\"\n\n\"And you will tell our children some day, won't you?\"\n\nVirginia blushed.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.\n\nYet Millet would have us understand that in spite of this, the\nshepherd is performing a duty to humanity not to be underrated. The\nsheep he has so carefully and conscientiously reared will form food\nto-morrow for many a hungry town-dweller. Further, he would have us\nfollow the peasant as he closes the pen for the night and traces his\ntired steps towards his simple home in the village. The frugal and\nhard-earned meal, prepared for him by his wife, who like himself has\nhad her share of duties to occupy her during the day, is partaken of\nsurrounded by a hungry and joyous group of children. Such themes\nsuggested by the simplicity of his own life appealed to him with\nirresistible force, and it is in their portrayal that his greatness is\nmanifested.\n\nPerhaps no season of the year presented the same attraction for Millet\nas the spring. The period when all the earth after its long winter\nsleep is about to waken into new life seems to have always been a\nsource of inspiration to him. In \"The Sower\" he emphasises the fact\nthat the fruits of the harvest are not to be had without due labour\nbeing expended upon the earth. The sloping field, barren of\nvegetation, and crowned at the top with a small clump of trees, is\nbeing broken up by the distant plough drawn by two horses and guided\nby a peasant. The latter figure is one of the noblest of Millet's\ncreations. By his strained and ever-attentive attitude, by his\ncontinuous tramp over the rough and broken ground, he shows us the\nmonotony of his toil. He crosses the field in one direction, only to\nreturn at an interval of a few feet. In the foreground we have the\nsower, a middle-aged man of typical peasant type, on whose left side a\nbag of seeds is slung. With automatic precision he withdraws a\nhandful, and strews it into the furrows open to receive it. So long as\nhe continues in the same track his labour will be well performed, and\nhence his task is just as monotonous as that of his fellow-worker\nhigher up in the field. The silhouetting of these two figures against\nthe light is symbolical of the labour to be expended in life before\nresults are forthcoming.\n\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that in considering the works of\nMillet, one must not judge him from the standpoint of a mere painter.\n\nHis brush is only the means to an end, and by its means he is enabled\nto bring the fruits of his philosophic observation before us in\npermanent form. It has been charged against the \"Angelus\" that it was\nnot a remarkably fine piece of painting, that many a young artist of\nthe present generation is infinitely better equipped, technically\nspeaking, than the master who wrought this celebrated canvas. This may\nin a measure be true, but it must never be forgotten that Millet\nbrought into play exactly the means which could illustrate his meaning\nin the clearest terms. He had not intended, in painting such a\npicture, to produce a work which would astonish his fellow artists\nwith its brilliancy of handling or magnificence of colour. He wanted\nto make the beholder forget the painter and absorb the lesson. This\nquality runs right through the art of Millet, and it is from this\nstandpoint that we are obliged to weigh his merits.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE\n\n\nJean Fran\u00e7ois Millet was born on October 4, 1814, that is at the\nperiod when French art, at any rate as far as landscape painting is\nconcerned, had reached its lowest ebb. Throughout the eighteenth\ncentury the landscape painter had been hard put to make a living. The\ntaste of connoisseurs throughout the century had been for portraits\nand interiors, or for those numerous pastoral subjects which were\ncarried out with so much decorative charm by such men as Watteau and\nBoucher. Such landscape painting as existed was of the type\npopularised by Vernet; it was built upon a curious mixture of Italian\ninfluence coming from Panini and Salvator Rosa. The only evidence of\nrevolt against such a state of affairs we find in the works of Hubert\nRobert and Moreau. These two, and more especially would I direct the\nreader's attention to the latter, struggled hard to break down the\nconventionalities of the time. They endeavoured to infuse some sense\nof atmosphere into their pictures, and whilst frequently their trees\nand figures are painfully formal, they yet stand alone in the French\nschool as the pioneers of a phase of art which was to attain its\nzenith in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBut after the Revolution, and during the whole of the time that France\nwas under the domination of Napoleon, very rigid principles indeed\nwere enforced with regard to the direction that art should take. The\ninnovation which had its commencement in the reign of Louis XVI. swept\neverything before it as it gained force. Classical art and traditions\ndominated the whole French school, and no artist, however great his\nreputation, attempted for many years to swim against the stream. In\nspite of the principles of liberty and equality which were claimed for\nall under the new r\u00e9gime, a terribly strict eye was kept upon any\ninnovations which might break out in the form of a naturalistic art.\n\nThe directors of this new movement failed to see that the conditions\nwhich had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed\naway, and that the latter's supremacy was due to the fact that their\nproductions were symbolical of the loftiest thoughts of their own\nepoch. The art which expresses the ambitions and noblest thoughts of\nits time will alone endure. These expressions are not applicable to\nany other condition than those which called them forth, and hence in\nattempting to purify the rococo which had existed up to the middle of\nthe eighteenth century, by a return to classical traditions, they were\nonly copying that which their predecessors had done, and in so doing\nleft us without any original expression of their own time.\n\nInto such a condition of affairs was Millet born, and he was numbered\namongst that little band of men which included Rousseau, Corot, Dupr\u00e9,\nDiaz, and Daumier, who were to lay the foundations of the modern\nnaturalistic school. At the outset it was seemingly a hopeless\nstruggle they undertook; a struggle against prejudice and influence\nwhich was only to be brought to a victorious culmination after years\nof struggle and disappointment. Of this little band, Millet was\nperhaps the best equipped for the privations which were necessary. He\ncame of a peasant stock who inhabited Gruchy, a small village\nsituated in the commune of Gr\u00e9ville, close to Cherbourg. Grouped\nunderneath the humble roof was the grandmother, who had been left a\nwidow fifteen years before; her son, Jean Louis Nicolas Millet, and\nhis wife and eight children, of which our artist was the second. His\ngrandmother appears to have been a pious old lady, whose chief delight\nwas in her grandchildren, to whom she taught those religious\nprinciples which stood them in good stead in after life. We are told\nthat Millet's father possessed a force of character one does not often\nfind amongst men in his rank of life. He was of a contemplative\ndisposition, and had a keenly developed feeling for natural beauty. He\npossessed moreover a keen appreciation of music, which unfortunately\nhe does not appear to have had much opportunity of cultivating. His\nwife was an excellent housewife and of a religious turn of mind. The\nhouse they occupied, situated quite a short distance from the sea, was\nplaced in a tract of country which, whilst it had rugged and\npicturesque features, was not of a nature which would yield\nextraordinary results under cultivation. It was, therefore, a hard\nstruggle for existence which Millet in his first years saw going\non around him. Not that the family were any the less happy for having\nto work laboriously for their livelihood. They had been brought up\namidst such surroundings; their wants were simple and easily\ngratified, and the tranquillity of the m\u00e9nage more than\ncounterbalanced those doubtful luxuries which easier circumstances\nwould have brought their way. Throughout his life Millet maintained\nthe extreme simplicity he had seen practised in the home of his\nchildhood, and long years afterwards he was accustomed to look back\nwith pleasureable memories upon his early years.\n\nGruchy, situated in one of the wildest parts of Normandy, feels the\nfull effect of every storm which blows up from the Atlantic. There is\nnothing to shelter the exposed hamlets studded along the coast from\nthe fury of the western gale, and the rocks are but too often strewn\nwith the wrecks of vessels which have come to grief in that terrible\nsea. Millet in his youth must have witnessed many of these\ncatastrophes. Quite a number of drawings by him are extant\nrepresenting succour being extended to some vessel in difficulties, or\nthe hauling up of some wreckage on to the rocks. The studious boy\nmust have been impressed as he saw the sternness of the combat in his\nnative country between men and nature; the wind-swept fields, and\nhills bare to the point of savageness. The very trees themselves\ndwarfed and gnarled; in their struggle with the elements they have\nbeen made tough and hardy as the inhabitants of the country\nthemselves, and, stunted as they are, yet show well that they can\nresist the force of the fiercest storm. The brooding and contemplative\ncharacter of the father having descended to the son, we can quite\nimagine the effect such surroundings would have upon him. As he looked\nback in after years upon his roamings in his native country, he\nappreciated the awe-inspiring character of the scenery in which he had\nbeen born. He would doubtless recall many a walk amidst the fields\nwith the wind blowing in his face as it rushed in from the Atlantic,\nthe rain beating hard upon the freshly ploughed fields, and the\ndistant figure of the ploughman struggling hard with his team against\nthe stiff sou'wester. The great mass of vapour overhead whirled before\nthe violence of the storm, casting grey and pearly light over the\nwhole scene, whilst far away on the top of the hill a clump of trees,\nbent with their resistance to the wind, are silhouetted against the\nsky. Many a drawing of this kind we encounter in the later work of\nMillet, which shows how his thoughts harked back in certain moments to\nthe scenes he had left behind him for ever.\n\nWe know that on one or two occasions he returned to Gruchy. Once or\ntwice he had urgent business which took him back, but sometimes he\nwent with no other purpose than to renew acquaintance with the scenes\nof yore.\n\nLittle Jean Fran\u00e7ois was his grandmother's favourite. It was she who\ntaught him the names of things which surrounded him, and perhaps\ndirected his thoughts in the channels to which they were finally to be\ndevoted. Her brother Charles, who formed one of the family, used to\ntake him for walks, telling him stories on the way. Millet was\ndevotedly attached to this old man, and when at the age of seven years\nhe lost him, the gap in his life thus left made an impression upon his\nmemory never to be effaced.\n\nFive years afterwards he was placed in the hands of the vicar for the\npurpose of preparing him for his first communion. The good man seems\nto have been taken with the child; he found him so attentive to all\nnatural phenomenon which was passing around him and intelligent in an\nunusual degree. He quickly learnt a considerable amount of Latin,\nwhich introduced him to the great classics. Unfortunately for Millet,\nthe vicar accepted an offer of transference to a better parish in the\nvicinity. The boy had made such progress with his master that it was\ndecided that he should go with him to his new abode. He was, however,\nso missed in his own home, that when he came back for his first\nholidays it was decided that he should not return.\n\nHe now gave serious attention to the agricultural pursuits of his\nfather. He threw himself heartily into the work of the farm, and\nassisted in the work of sowing and harvesting, of pruning and\nthrashing according to the season. His spare time was occupied in\nreading with avidity various masterpieces of literature. The authors\nhe found at hand were such as F\u00e9n\u00e9lon and Bossuet, but he developed a\ndecided preference, which lasted till the end of his life, for Virgil\nand the Bible.\n\nIt was at this time that his taste for art began to be developed.\n\nHe drew the objects he found around him, and soon acquired sufficient\nconfidence in his skill to execute a large drawing representing two\nshepherds keeping guard over their sheep. These first efforts date\nfrom about his seventeenth year, and foretell the advent of the style\nin which he was later to become pre-eminent.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE MIGRATION TO PARIS\n\n\nHow frequently has it happened that the first years in the life of a\ngenius have been employed in labour quite different from that to which\nthey should have been directed. Such a state of affairs the more often\noccurs when the sense of duty has been strong enough to overcome\ntemporarily the inclination to pursue the natural bent. In the case of\nMillet, however, the early years which he devoted to the farm and its\npursuits were by no means wasted. It is on record that he became very\nproficient in the various duties in which he was engaged, but at the\nsame time we can be quite sure that his extraordinary faculties of\nobservation were constantly being brought into play, and the fruits of\nhis observations are to be seen in the pictures of his mature period.\n\nA considerable portion of his spare time was taken up with drawing,\nnot only the persons and objects he found around him, but also\nsubjects suggested to him by the books he was in the habit of reading.\n\nHis family, so far from throwing any obstacles in his way, encouraged\nhim. In fact it was his father who took him first to Cherbourg in\norder to show a painter of that town, named Mouchel, the early\nproducts of his son's genius. The decision at which Millet p\u00e8re had\narrived was prompted by a drawing in charcoal of an old peasant\nwalking along the road, which had struck him forcibly as being a work\nof extraordinary merit. It says much for Mouchel's breadth of mind\nthat he was equally impressed with the drawings. A man who had been\nbrought up in the school of David, and who had lived in one of the\nmost reactionary periods of French art, was hardly to be expected to\ntake kindly to a style so diametrically opposed to all the traditions\ninto which he himself had been inculcated; certainly the young\nMillet, who had now arrived at the age of eighteen, had not developed\nthe extraordinary freedom which his works of ten years later\ndemonstrate. But there was sufficient originality even in his early\ndrawings to call forth condemnation from a man who had been so\nsaturated with the teaching of David.\n\nHe prevailed upon Millet to leave his son with him, and set him to\nwork to copy many well-known works of art which he brought before his\npupil by means of engravings. Two months were spent in this way when\nnews reached Millet that his father had been seized with sudden\nillness, and he was obliged in the circumstances to return to\nGr\u00e9ville. He arrived to find the old man unconscious, and very shortly\nafterwards he died.\n\nThis misfortune awoke in Millet a sense of duty which compelled him to\ndesert his studies in Cherbourg and superintend the management of the\nfarm. For some time he devoted himself entirely to his new duties, but\nthe struggle betwixt duty and genius continued; he gave himself to his\nwork with all the energy at his disposal, but his thoughts were ever\nwandering to his art.\n\nAdded to his own inclinations, his grandmother, who perceived his\nextraordinary gifts, strongly persuaded him to devote his attention\nentirely to art, and consequently after some little time he decided to\nreturn to Cherbourg. Here he entered the studio of M. Langlois, an\nartist whose reputation in the town was considerable. Again in this\nworthy man he came in contact with a painter who had been brought up\nentirely under classical influence. Langlois, who had in his early\ndays been a pupil of Gros, had absorbed the classical tradition to\nsuch an extent as to be incapable of appreciating any other style. He\nappears to have endeavoured to mould Millet in his own method rather\nthan develop the latent genius which the latter possessed. The\nincompatibility of these two men speedily caused the younger to strike\nout in his own way. He saw more good in frequenting the museums and\nmaking copies of such works as appealed to him than in listening to\nthe advice of his teacher. All this occurred, however, without any\nbreach of friendship occurring. On the contrary, Langlois, after\nperceiving the futility of inducing his pupil to follow in his\nfootsteps, did all he could to advance his interests.\n\nBy means of his influence some of Millet's drawings were brought\nbefore the Municipal Council, and Langlois suggested that Millet\nshould be sent to Paris in order to further his development, and that\nthe Council should set aside a modest pension to meet his requirements\nin that city. The discussion appears to have been very prolonged, and\nupon the question being put to a vote it was only carried by means of\nthe casting vote of the mayor. Four hundred francs was at first\nallotted to him in this way, which was further increased shortly\nafterwards to six hundred. Such encouragement, meagre though it was,\nwas sufficient to give him a foothold in the metropolis. He left\nCherbourg in January 1837, on a cold and raw day, the snow falling\nheavily throughout the entire journey, and arrived in Paris in a very\ndisheartened condition. The miserable weather, coupled with the long\njourney in which he had had time to think of the small sum which lay\nbetween him and starvation, going to a city which he had never seen\nbefore, had all served to work upon his nerves, and he entered the\ngreat city sick at heart and very despondent.\n\nOne of the first visits he made after he was somewhat settled down in\nParis was to the Louvre. Here he was brought into contact for the\nfirst time with many masters, who were to mould his yet plastic\ntemperament into the form which enabled him to give to the world, in\nlater years, so many masterpieces. As I have said before, it was\nMantegna who first captivated him, and the influence of the mighty\nPaduan was never finally to be shaken off. Michel Angelo awed him with\nhis sublimity; his classical severity tempered with intense humanism,\nhis masculine strength, were bound to have their effect upon so\nserious a character as Millet. Strange as it may seem to those who are\nbut superficially acquainted with his art, and are only too apt to\njudge him by the influence he has had upon modern French painting, he\nwas fascinated with the antique. The traditions of Phidias and\nPraxiteles, in the form in which they had been transmitted through the\ngreatest minds of the Renaissance, were ever the factors which guided\nhim throughout his career. It was this same spirit which impelled his\nfervid admiration for Nicolas Poussin, a master who to-day is sadly\nunderrated and but little understood. It was the mysteries of line,\nthe wonders of pose and composition rather than the magic of colour\nwhich appealed to him. He had a profound admiration for the glowing\ncanvases of Titian and Rubens, but he could never overlook entirely\ntheir defects of drawing or, in the case of Rubens, the tendency to\nvulgarity. From his remarks in after years it would appear that he was\nbaffled with the mysticisms of Velazquez and Rembrandt; pure painting\nitself could never hold him. He needed to grasp the message which lay\nbehind it before he felt fully taken into the confidence of the\npainter; and as the minds of the Dutchman and the Spaniard ran in\nquite different channels to his own, they spoke with a language he\nnever understood. That he had a perceptive and critically independent\nmind may be gauged from his enthusiasm for Delacroix, whose work he\nencountered for the first time at the Luxembourg.\n\nDuring this period of study he was carefully considering under what\nmaster he should place himself. His choice unhappily fell upon\nDelaroche. To any one acquainted with the work of the latter master,\na more unsuitable selection could not have been made. Delaroche and\nthe painters who surrounded him can be appropriately described as\nconstituting the back-wash of the Empire style, which had reached its\nclimax with David. His subjects were always treated with academic\nreserve. No pyrotechnics were permitted; on the contrary, an\neverlasting and mistaken striving for finish was encouraged:\noriginality was sternly suppressed. To paint human life as it really\nwas, was too vulgar for any of the painters of this time. They held\nthe public taste enslaved for years. An innovator such as Millet was\ndestined to become found his position almost untenable. The band of\ncritics and painters formed a monopoly which it seemed almost\nimpossible to break down, and it was only after years of bitter and\ndetermined struggle that the school of nature finally routed its\nopponent.\n\nDelaroche doubtlessly found the peasant painter a little rude both in\nhis person and in his ideas about art. He paid but little attention to\nthe young man who had placed himself in his hands, and devoted all his\ntime to students who were more amenable to his influence. A\ntemperament so sensitive as Millet's was bound to notice this\nneglect, and consequently after a time he became so discouraged that\nhe ceased to frequent Delaroche's studio. Another very good reason for\nthis action was the lack of resources to continue his payments. Even\nduring the time he had been with Delaroche he lost no opportunity of\nturning a few honest francs by painting the portraits of any who could\nbe got to sit to him. Delaroche, however, had a more kindly heart than\nMillet imagined. He seems to have found out the real distress of the\nyoung artist, and to have assisted him pecuniarily in many ways, and\nthere is no doubt that he appreciated the talent of the young Norman\nmuch more than he cared to own. Many of his remarks on record would\nserve to show that Delaroche already felt that his pupil was destined\nto be one of the leaders of the movement which was finally to\noverthrow his own style, and doubtlessly felt a great admiration for a\nman who had the courage and strength to swim against rather than with\nthe current.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STRUGGLE FOR RECOGNITION\n\n\nFreed from all encumbrances save poverty, Millet was now to work out\nhis own destiny according to the dictates of his genius. He joined a\nfriend named Marolle, and the two together occupying a very small\napartment endeavoured to eke out an existence. It was only too soon\napparent that young as he was, and the taste of the public being not\nyet ready for development upon the lines his genius directed him, that\nhis livelihood could not be secured by endeavouring to sell such\nsubjects as appealed to him. In these straits he turned to\nportrait-painting, just as many great painters before and since him\nhave done. That the struggle was very keen can well be imagined by the\nfact that he was unable to obtain more than five to ten francs apiece;\nand, as commissions were very scarce, he was hard put to gain the\nmeans of subsistence. This state of affairs lasted until 1840, in\nwhich year he endeavoured to obtain admission to the Salon with two\nportraits, one of which was that of his friend. This, however, was\nrejected, and the other picture, although accepted, was unnoticed by\neither the critics or the public.\n\nHaving occasion the next year to pay a visit to Cherbourg, he felt\nobliged to report himself to the Municipal Council who had had the\ngenerosity to send him in the first place to Paris. Its worthy members\nexpressed themselves as but little satisfied with the result of their\ninvestment; they claimed that they had had as yet but little to show\nfor their money, and they suggested, partly as a means of\ndemonstrating that they had had some little return, and also, in order\nto see of what stuff their prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was made, that he should paint a\nportrait of the recently deceased mayor. As Millet had not been\npersonally acquainted with that worthy citizen, and as the only guide\nwhich could be supplied him was a portrait made in miniature when he\nwas a young man of some twenty-three or twenty-four years of age, the\ntask was by no means easy. However, the artist set to work with a\nwill, and finally accomplished the picture to his own satisfaction.\n\nUpon it being shown to the Council, one and all declared, as any one\nwith the slightest knowledge of such matters could have told them\nbefore it was commenced, that it bore not the least resemblance to the\ndefunct magistrate. They therefore demurred at the three hundred\nfrancs they had agreed to pay him for the portrait, and offered him\none-third of that amount instead. Millet was deeply offended by the\ninsult, and informed the Council that he made them a present of the\npicture.\n\nIt was during this short visit to his native country that he met his\nfirst wife, a Mlle. Ono, whose portrait he had painted. From the first\nshe was very delicate, and he lost her after much suffering, three\nyears later. His second wife was Mlle. Catherine Lemaire, who was\ndestined to be the companion of his struggles until the end of his\nlife.\n\nMeanwhile Millet was occupied with subjects which he thought would\nappeal to the general public. A number of classical pictures date from\nthis epoch. It was an endeavour on his part to fall in as far as\npossible with the current taste, and so supply means of subsistence\nfor his family. At the same time he did not neglect his favourite\nsubjects, and many are the wonderful studies of peasant life which\ndate from these years. His reputation had so far advanced that he was\noffered the position of teacher of drawing in the college at\nCherbourg. It must have been only after prolonged deliberation that he\nrefused the proffered post. Here a certain annual stipend was assured\nhim, and if it was not large in itself it would at any rate suffice to\nkeep the wolf from the door. He preferred, however, to return to Paris\nand work out his own destiny as best he might.\n\nMillet, who lived at this time in the Rue Rochechouart, began to\nsurround himself with that little group of friends who remained\nfaithful to him until the end of his career. Amongst the earliest were\nCharles Jacque and Diaz: the latter had several clients amongst the\nsmall dealers, whom he induced to visit Millet's studio and make now\nand again a small purchase.\n\nMillet now became a fairly regular contributor to the Salon, but\ngenerally sent some classical or religious picture as well as one of\nhis peasant subjects. For example, in 1848 he sent the marvellous\nstudy of \"The Winnower,\" which we all know so well, accompanied by a\ncanvas, \"The Captivity of the Jews at Babylon.\" The latter, however,\nwas so badly received that he utilised the canvas upon its return for\na large picture of a \"Shepherdess tending her Sheep.\"\n\nIn spite of the headway that he was making, the struggle for existence\nseemed keener than ever, and but for the kindness of friends he and\nhis family would frequently have actually wanted for food. A timely\nadvance of one hundred francs obtained for him from the Minister of\nFine Arts, together with a commission from the State, for which he was\npaid the sum of eighteen hundred francs, were for some time the only\nrelief he obtained from his embarrassments. That he was not particular\nas to how he earned his daily bread is apparent from the fact that he\ndid not despise an order for a shop sign for a midwife, for which he\nwas paid the miserable amount of thirty francs.\n\nThe year 1848 was not an encouraging one for a painter who was\nstanding on the threshold of his career. The whole of Europe was\nseething with revolution. A repetition of the fearful year of 1792 was\neverywhere expected. The struggle betwixt reaction and property on the\none hand, and lawlessness and revolution on the other, was being waged\nwith grim determination. The issue was for long in the balance. One\nnever knew from one day to another what was going to happen. In such a\ndeplorable state of affairs men's minds were running on politics and\nwars rather than upon art. Millet amongst the rest was called upon to\nshoulder the musket, and it can be easily imagined with what\nreluctance he did so.\n\nParis, the great centre of art, had yet not afforded him much\nencouragement. Life was dear in the big city, and surrounded on all\nsides by bricks and mortar he was not free to go out into the fields\nand study the objects which were uppermost in his mind. He resolved to\nescape from it, and once having put the plan into execution he never\nreturned.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET IN HIS MATURITY\n\n\nThe Barbizon of 1850 was a very different place from the Barbizon of\nto-day. The world fame of the men who passed a quiet and strenuous\nexistence in the little village has transformed it into a tourist\nresort, with restaurants and caf\u00e9s, the stopping-places for\nwaggonettes which in summer bring their daily load of sightseers,\neager to see the homes of the painters whose names are now household\nwords.\n\nIt would have been well-nigh impossible for the little band to have\nchosen a more suitable spot for their labours. Rousseau and Millet,\nmuch as they were drawn towards each other by the tie of a sympathetic\ndisposition and by their common interest in art, yet were widely\ndissimilar from one another in their outlook upon art and their\nmethods of worship at the common shrine. Rousseau--one can see it from\nevery picture he painted--loved with all the yearning of a passionate\nand restless temperament the inanimate in Nature. Observe with what\nfidelity he draws his trees, with what caressing tenderness his clouds\nand skies are treated; solitude appealed to him above all things, and\nif here and there he was obliged to insert a few figures to complete\nhis composition, one instinctively feels that he would rather have\nsubstituted a group of cattle or a flock of sheep. In the glades of\nthe forest, far from the busy haunts of men, with the glorious\nsunlight penetrating from above, the breeze moaning through the\nbranches, he was happy. A wild and turbulent temperament such as his\nnot infrequently discovers exquisite enjoyment amidst such perfect\ntranquillity.\n\nBarbizon, situated on the fringe of the great forest of Fontainebleau,\ntherefore, permitted Rousseau to come into daily contact with the\nscenes which so appealed to him.\n\nMillet, on the other hand, was absorbed in the peasant. The man who\ntilled the soil and raised the produce humanity requires for its\nsubsistence by the sweat of his brow; the manifold duties of the\nlabourer, his life and sorrows, appealed to him with irresistible\nforce. An unpeopled track of wild and uncultivated land would not call\nforth any emotion in him, no matter how sublime the scenery might be.\n\nThe life of the village, spreading itself into the vast and fertile\nplain behind, held him absorbed; a peasant himself and living amongst\nthe people he so loved, he was in a position to bring before an\nunthinking world the poignant monotony of their useful lives.\n\nUpon their first arrival at Barbizon, the two artists put up at a\nsmall inn, working all day in a tiny place they had rented from some\npeasants and fitted up as a studio. The inconveniences of this\narrangement were soon apparent, and shortly afterwards Millet took a\nsmall house which was destined to be his abode for the remainder of\nhis life; an old barn in the immediate vicinity meanwhile provided him\nwith an excellent studio.\n\nFrom this period onward we must date the greatest productions of the\nmaster, the works which have induced more thought than those of any\nother peasant painter. A peasant among peasants, his life was of the\nmost rigid simplicity. Behind his little abode a large garden\nstretched away almost to the fringe of the forest itself, and here he\nwas accustomed to work every morning, growing a portion of the food\nnecessary to the sustenance of his family. The afternoon he devoted to\npainting, whilst the evening was given over to intercourse with his\nlittle circle of friends. The simplicity and tranquillity of his life\naroused the whole of his powers to action, and surrounded with\neverything he valued in life he was supremely happy.\n\nThe country around Barbizon appealed to him irresistibly. The\ntimber-studded plains, the gently undulating, highly cultivated\nfields, presented a strange contrast to the wild and rugged country\namidst which he had spent his childhood, and no doubt conduced to the\ndevelopment of a more refined and contemplative style than he would\notherwise have acquired. Upon his few visits to his native country he\nappears to have been more impressed than ever with its austerity, and\nthe drawings which these journeys called forth bore ample evidence of\nthis feeling in him.\n\nLack of the necessary funds to carry on even his simple m\u00e9nage was\never the bane of Millet's life. On many occasions Sensier, his\nintimate friend and afterwards his biographer, informs us he dissuaded\nhim from suicide.\n\nThe sums that he owed, small though they were, rendered him in\nconstant fear of the brokers. With creditors so importunate in their\ndemands for satisfaction, and with the constant lack of recognition,\nwhich was his lot, it is astonishing that Millet achieved so much. He\nwas relieved more than once by the kind-hearted and ever faithful\nRousseau, who when his friend was sorest pressed found some delicately\nhidden means to relieve him. It was he who acquired for 4000 francs\nthe wonderful \"Peasant grafting a Tree,\" when the picture failed to\nfind a purchaser; and in order that Millet should not be aware of his\ngenerosity, he made the offer in the name of an imaginary American.\n\nThis sort of goodness he repeated more than once, and it redounds\nstill more to his credit when we remember that Rousseau himself was\nnot infrequently in pecuniary difficulties.\n\nA constant succession of important works made their appearance during\nthe first ten years Millet spent at Barbizon. The first was the\nwell-known \"Sower,\" which has ever been one of the most popular of his\npictures. Then came the far finer \"Peasants going to Work,\" which for\nmany years was in an English Collection. The \"Gleaners,\" perhaps the\nnoblest canvas the master ever painted, dates from 1857, in which year\nit was seen at the Salon; the celebrated \"Angelus\" followed it two\nyears later. The prices which Millet obtained for this series of\nremarkable works was fantastically small. The \"Gleaners\" brought him a\npaltry 2000 francs, whilst he accounted himself lucky to encounter an\namateur who gave him the same sum for the small \"Woman feeding Fowls.\"\n\nThe \"Angelus,\" which was never exhibited, was sold in the year it was\npainted to a Monsieur Feydeau, an architect, for 1800 francs. It then\npassed through several hands before the late Monsieur Secr\u00e9tan\ncompeted up to 160,000 francs before he became possessed of the prize\nat the John Wilson sale.\n\nThe purchase, however, proved a sound investment, for upon the\ndispersal of his collection it was knocked down for 553,000 francs to\na Monsieur Proust, acting on behalf of the French Government. The\nlatter, however, when they gave the commission to buy the picture, had\nno idea that such a high value would be placed upon it, and\nconsequently refused to ratify the sale; a syndicate now came upon the\nscene, who took it to America. The price, however, proved greater than\neven the millionaires of the States were prepared to give, and the\ncanvas again returned to France, where it found a resting-place in the\ncollection of Monsieur Chauchard, who paid the enormous sum of 800,000\nfrancs for its possession.\n\nIn 1859 Millet sent two works to the Salon, a \"Woman grazing her Cow,\"\nand \"Death and the Woodman.\" The latter, one of the most\nphilosophical of Millet's pictures, which to-day is the principal\nattraction of the Jacobsen Museum at Copenhagen, was rejected.\n\nDisappointments of this kind came with such systematic regularity to\nthe painter that he must have become proof against them. He always had\nbitter enemies amongst the critics, who never failed to pour abuse\nupon his method and his subjects. Even a number of his fellow artists\njoined in the chorus of disapproval. But the vehemence with which he\nwas attacked was striking evidence of the impression he was making and\nthe inward sense of his own powers; and the fact that he was working\nout his destiny according to the dictates of his own genius supported\nhim against this outpouring of prejudice and malice. The social side\nof life appealed to him more strongly as the years rolled on, and the\nmurmurings which had been heard in 1859 as to the socialistic\ntendencies of \"Death and the Woodman\" swelled to a roar when the\nstupendous \"Man with the Hoe\" was exhibited fourteen years later. The\nlatter, one of the most virile studies of depraved humanity which the\nworld has ever seen, has always been a favourite with social\nreformers, and has inspired one remarkable poem. Even his most\nimplacable critics were disarmed before this canvas; its power was\nmagnetic; it was an inspiration, soul moving and trenchant.\n\nHis financial difficulties never completely dispersed. At one time, in\norder to insure himself a little tranquillity, he made a contract with\ntwo speculators, whereby they were to become possessors of all the\nwork he produced for three years, in consideration of their assuring\nhim a thousand francs a month. A great number of Millet's finest\nproductions passed thus through their hands, including the \"Return\nfrom the Fields\" and the \"Man with the Hoe.\" The partners were not\nlong in quarrelling, and after a lawsuit had been fought, Millet was\nleft in the hands of a man who frequently would not or could not pay\nhim in ready money, and whose bills he was frequently forced to\ndiscount at considerable loss.\n\nOne little gleam of sunshine rendered his later days happy. This was a\ncommission from a Colmar banker, Monsieur Thomas by name, who required\nfour allegorical compositions representing the Seasons, to decorate\nhis rooms. The artist was overjoyed by this piece of good fortune,\nand immediately commenced a most conscientious study of such mural\ndecoration as was within reach, in order that he might do full justice\nto his patron. He paid frequent visits to Fontainebleau and the\nLouvre, and even desired a friend to inquire if he could not obtain\nreproductions of the frescoes at Herculaneum and Pompeii. In spite of\nall this elaborate preparation, the subjects were not such as appealed\nto his genius, and in spite of them being well and soundly painted, we\nare told that they presented no features which called for special\ncomment.\n\nHe found, however, a much more genial occupation in accomplishing a\nseries of drawings ordered by a Monsieur Gavet, who paid the artist\n1000, 700, and 450 francs each, according to their size. He made\naltogether ninety-five drawings in this way, and it is said that this\ngentleman had in his possession the finest work in black and white and\nwater-colour the artist ever executed.\n\nTowards the latter end of his life the death of dear relatives and\nfriends cast a sorrowful gloom over him. Amongst the latter Rousseau,\nwho expired in his presence on the 22nd of December 1867, was\nperhaps the loss which seemed to him hardest to bear. A staunch and\ntrusty friend, who was to be relied upon when his prospects seemed the\nmost hopeless, he had been one of the very few who had appreciated\nMillet's talents at their full worth, and who, moreover, scanty as his\nown means were, was ever ready to stretch out his hand to assist his\nstruggling friend.\n\nShortly afterwards Millet paid a visit to his patron, Herr Hartmann,\nat M\u00fcnster, and from here he went for a short time into Switzerland.\n\nUpon his return he devoted himself with great earnestness to work, and\nachieved a certain success at the Salons with his exhibits. The\noutbreak of the war with Germany caused him to migrate with his family\nto Cherbourg, where he thought he might continue to work, removed as\nfar as possible from the scenes of carnage and struggle which were\ngoing on farther east. Transported once more amongst the scenes of his\nchildhood, he felt an increased impetus to production, and when he\nreturned to Barbizon late in 1871, he brought with him a number of\ncanvases of the highest quality; conspicuous amongst them was the\nwonderful \"Gr\u00e9ville Church,\" now in the Louvre.\n\nThe anxieties of his troublous life were, however, beginning to show\ntheir effect upon his constitution; a persistent cough developed, and\nalthough an amelioration would occasionally occur, it was always\nsucceeded by a worse condition than before. His health suffered a\ngeneral decline, and he finally breathed his last on the 20th of\nJanuary 1875. He was buried in the little cemetery of Chailly, beside\nhis friend Rousseau, amidst the scenery they both loved so well.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE MAN AND HIS ART\n\n\nMillet is an instance of an artist working out his own destiny,\nimpelled by irresistible genius, in the teeth of seemingly\ninsurmountable obstacles. He started life with enormous disadvantages;\nwithout friends in influential circles to spread his fame or plead his\ncause; without money to enable him to outlive and triumph over the\nignorant fanaticism of critics and artists, so soaked in the\nconventionalised art of their time that they had not perception enough\nto appreciate the full meaning of that naturalistic movement, which\nwas finally to sweep away the quasi-classic art they boasted of with\nsuch bombastic effusion. The path was hard and thorny, and his triumph\nwas not finally consummated until after his death. He himself found\nhis only satisfaction in the fact that he had lived his life according\nto the dictates of his genius, and had achieved the maximum of which\nhe was capable.\n\nMillet and our own Cotman were somewhat kindred spirits; there is much\nmore affinity between the work of the two men than is apparent to any\none who has not closely studied them. The marvellous \"Breaking the\nClod,\" now happily permanently housed at the British Museum, betrays\nthe same tremendous conception and broad outlook which characterises\nmany a drawing of Millet's. Both highly strung to a painful extent,\nthey were each conscious of their inability to curb the power which\nprescribed a certain course for them, and in spite of pecuniary\ndifficulties and unpopularity, an inevitable result of their intense\noriginality, they pursued a steady course to the end of their lives.\n\nThe socialistic doctrines which have been read into the work of Millet\nare rather the outcome of the world's uneasy conscience being brought\nface to face with a crushing indictment of existing conditions, than\nof any design on the artist's part to further the cause of a political\npropaganda by means of his art. This somewhat extravagant reading into\nhis art has certainly been carried to excess. Particularly has such\nbeen the case in America, where a large number of his finest works are\nat present to be found, curiously enough in the hands of enormously\nwealthy people, who are frequently perhaps the least able to\nunderstand the real meaning of his message.\n\nComing from a peasant stock, his sympathies were always with the\npeasant; it was the only class he understood or cared for. He lived as\none of them, and shared to a large extent in their labour. He has been\ndesignated, not inappropriately, the philosopher in sabots. Rightly or\nwrongly he has come to be looked upon as one of the high priests of\ncommunistic doctrines. Few pictures have been so anathematised as the\n\"Man with the Hoe,\" and perhaps none have done more to inculcate\nsympathy with the degradation of the lower orders of the human race.\n\nThe revolting brutality and vacancy of that face haunts the\nimagination. Is it possible that fellow-creatures so utterly debased\nby toil and neglect exist? Millet dispels any doubt upon the question\nby bequeathing to humanity this trenchant portrait. By no means\nlimited to Barbizon or France, these poor creatures exist in every\ncountry, and curiously enough are considered an essential element in\neach country's development.\n\nThis poignantly human note is observable in almost every work Millet\nwrought; his passionate sympathy with his fellow-man is the keynote of\nhis art. The wood-cutter in his arduous toil, the shepherd in his\nsolitariness, the labourer turning the soil with unvarying and\nlaborious monotony, the mother caring for her children--all carry the\nsame message for him of that strange and incomprehensible mingling of\njoy and sadness we call life. Like many great minds before and since\nhis time, our artist found the greatest joy in life in a placid and\nnever changing melancholy. But the peasants he chose knew nothing of\nthe sadness he saw in them. Completely inured to their toil, and\nsubdued by it, with no refining or uplifting influence to stimulate\nthem, they knew nothing, aspired to nothing beyond what they were; it\nwas left to Millet to supply the \"might have been.\" He saw the inky\nblackness of the mind of the \"Man with the Hoe,\" the pathetic\ninequality between the mounted farmer directing the safe storage of\nhis crop, and the stooping figures of the \"Gleaners\" eager to scrape\nup the miserable crumbs which had fallen from the rich man's table. He\ntraced the lives of these simple folk until we arrive at the grim and\ngaunt figure of Death, who, as he grasps the woodman by the shoulder,\nreminds him that his course is finished and that he, in common with\nall his fellow-men, must enter the great unknown land from which there\nis no return. It is a sad and melancholy art, vibrating with purity\nand truth, the outpouring of a great soul yearning to express itself\nto the utmost of its power. The mind and character of the man can be\nread in every line and in every touch of the brush. His drawings and\netchings are even more searching in their virility than his pictures.\n\nThere is a spontaneousness about them we search for in vain in his\nwork in oil and pastel. In black and white his intensely emotional\nmind found a swift method of expression; in the laboriousness of oil\npainting he was fettered with the complications of the medium. It can\nbe fairly said that only in one or two paintings--a notable example\ncan be cited in the wondrous \"Sawyers\" at South Kensington--does he\nrise to the height of a great painter. Millet was a poet, a\nphilosopher, a great thinker, and the means he chose for expressing\nhimself were those which were best fitted to his purpose. His\npredilections in art were concentrated upon the greatest, and\nconsequently the men who appealed to him were the thinkers of the\nages. Mantegna and Correggio, Michel Angelo and the mighty Greeks,\nthese were the masters who left their impress upon his mind and art.\n\nThe influence of so sincere and profound an artist has necessarily\nbeen profound. He has moulded men who have achieved world-wide fame;\nSegantini, for example, would never have risen to the heights he did\nhad the example of Millet not been ever before him. There have been\nmany who, without possessing his genius, have endeavoured to follow\nin his footsteps, but successfully as his imitators have sometimes\ncaught his style, their productions can never live alongside his,\nbecause they lack the real ring of sincerity.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n        a. One bed, or folding cot,\n        b. One oil stove,\n        c. One lamp,\n        d. Enough supplies of all kinds sufficient for six months,\n        e. Pots, pans, kettles, etc.\nIt is needless to say that positions in Manila and Iloilo were now at\na premium.\n\nWas it possible that teachers were to be sent to places where even the\nnecessaries of life could not be obtained! Was it possible that many\nwould be sent to places so remote that for six months no fresh\nsupplies could be gotten! A mass meeting was held at once, and a\ncommittee was appointed to send a cablegram to the Associated Press\npetitioning aid from the American people at large. Realizing what\nconsternation would be created throughout the United States by such a\nmessage, two of the teachers leaped into a carriage at the close of\nthe meeting and a few moments later were closeted with the chief\nexecutive of the department. As a result the committee was persuaded\nnot to send the cablegram to the Associated Press until by courtesy it\nhad been sent to the President. Of course, this diplomatic move tided\naffairs over and the teachers who had flatly refused to budge from\nManila now agreed to go on to their stations, being assured that\nwhatever action was best would be taken.\n\nThe day had come when we must separate. We were to enter an untried\nand an unknown field. It was fitting that we have a final joyous\nmeeting, so the best orchestra in the archipelago was engaged and we\n\"chased the hours with flying feet\" until dawn so that whatever might\ncome to us in that unknown future upon which we were entering each\nwould hold in pleasant memory our last evening together.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER III. - A DRAMA IN ACTUAL LIFE.\n\n\nAlmost every one heeded the warning to go to his station forearmed\nwith at least necessaries of life, but, as it had never fallen to the\nlot of the writer to cook, he refused to learn at that late day, so he\ntook no pot, no pan, no kettle, putting his future into the hands of\nan uncertain fate and relying upon the unknown hospitality of the\nFilipino.\n\nBacalod, the capital of the province of Occidental Negros, was our\ndestination. The second morning after leaving Manila, we awoke with\nthe \"Kilpatrick\" lying at anchor in a shallow bay. We were several\nmiles from the shore and nothing in sight indicated that we had\nreached a place of any importance. Late the night before we had been\nawakened by the loud, sharp ringing of the ship's bells, accompanied\nby the reversal of the engines and a general disturbance awaking the\ncrew. So our first impressions on coming on deck were that we had run\naground. But the captain assured us that everything was ship-shape and\nthat this was the nearest point of approach to Capiz, a town of\nconsiderable importance on the island of Panay, where a body of troops\nwas to embark for home. Not even the grass hut of a native was in\nsight. Search as we would, not a sign was seen of a stream flowing\ninto the sea, indicating the probable presence of a town. There was\nnot a sign of life of any kind save one lone column of thin, blue\nsmoke that arose from the side of a mountain miles away. One would\nhave thought that we were explorers of three hundred years ago lying\noff the shore of some unknown land.\n\nAfter breakfast the steam launch, together with all the boats, was\nlowered, and several of us who had determined to miss no opportunity\nto gather information about the islands took our places in the launch\nby the side of the ship's mate, and steamed away across the water with\na long line of boats strung out in the rear. We headed away toward a\ngroup of cocoanut trees, and about an hour later stepped ashore on a\npile of decayed coral rocks that extended some twenty or thirty feet\nout into the water, thus forming the only landing place of a town of\nseveral thousands of people and of considerable commercial importance.\n\nA few moments after we had landed, an army wagon drawn by a\nmagnificent pair of mules came up out of a tropical jungle along a\nnarrow road. We clambered into the wagon and were soon lost in the\ndepths of foliage from which we had just seen the vehicle emerge.\n\nLong waving bamboos with their plumy leafage hung over the road from\neach side, meeting and overlapping in the center until they formed an\narchway so dense that the tropical sun now high in the heavens\npenetrated it only at intervals. At times the wagon sank up to the\nhubs in the soft earth, and the muscles of the mules stood out like\nwhip-cords under the skin as they drew us forward.\n\nAt a sharp turn in the road we came upon the first division of troops\nthat was to embark for home. The look of joy upon their sun-browned\nfaces was inexpressible. Their work was done, and with elastic step\nand smiling faces they saluted us as they passed by. The reign of\nforce was at an end; it was going out with them; the reign of peace\nhad begun; it was coming in with us.\n\nIn the afternoon when we returned from the town the last of the troops\nhad arrived and, as we drove up, the bugle was sounding the call to\nsupper. We noticed native women mingling with the troops and, indeed,\na native woman was in constant attention waiting upon one of the\nsoldiers with whom we ate. Her clothes were clean, her hair was nicely\ncombed, and her general appearance was neat. She seemed to anticipate\nthe slightest wish of the soldier with whom she was. She brought him\nwater to drink, cleaned his plate after the meal and saw that his\nknife, fork, and spoon were put into his haversack.\n\nWe had now finished supper and the launch had returned for the last\nload of troops. The lieutenant in command of the company gave the\norder to \"fall in\"; the men shouldered their rifles and fell into\nline. \"Forward, march!\" called the lieutenant, and the column swept\nforward towards the boats. The women had until now restrained\nthemselves, but, as their husbands marched away never to return, their\nfeelings could no longer be restrained. One young woman of about\neighteen, who was leaning against a rock by the roadside sobbing, when\nher husband passed, leaped up in frenzy of passionate love and caught\nthe rifle from his shoulder. Her first impulse seemed to be to throw\nthe gun away, but suddenly realizing the futility of such an act she\nburst into tears, shouldered the rifle herself and marched on by his\nside. Another woman of more mature age threw her arms around the legs\nof a tall stalwart man, and drew him bodily from the line.\n\nBut the troops marched on and entered the boats. One woman who had\nbeen unnoticed before came down into the shallow water and caught hold\nof our last boat as if to prevent its leaving, while others stood\nmingling their sobs with the sounds of the wavelets as they broke on\nthe sands. As we passed away, an expectant mother, standing in bold\noutline against the twilight sky, threw up her hands in an agony of\ndespair and then sank upon the stones. The curtain had fallen upon a\ndrama in actual life deeper in pathos than any other we had ever seen\nor ever expected to see. Depth of passion, depth of love! Who can\nfathom the human heart?\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. - WHAT THE TEACHERS DID.\n\n\nThere is a remarkable sameness about the towns in the Philippines.\n\nThey all have a large open square about the middle of the town, around\nthree sides of which are Chinese stores, unless one side lies open to\nthe sea, and on the fourth is the great stone ecclesia. The streets\nrun at right angles to one another and divide up the town into\ncreditable squares.\n\nEverybody in the Philippines lives up-stairs, for the ground is so\nsoaked with water during the rainy season that it is a menace to\nhealth to live upon the ground floor. So even the poorest nippa hut\nis built upon stakes four or five feet above the ground.\n\nBacalod is a typical Philippine town. As we landed, a broad open\nsquare was spread out before us. Two sides of the square were lined\nwith two-story houses in which were Chinese stores below and Filipino\nhomes above. On the third side stood the great stone church in whose\nmassive tower the clock was striking the hour of four, while the\nfourth lay open to the sea that had borne us thither.\n\nWe landed, but it was in a method new to us and one not usually\nemployed by the traveling public.\n\nWhen our sail boat ran aground on the sandy bottom a hundred yards or\nmore from the shore, a crowd of Filipino men who were on the beach\nslowly rolled up their pantaloons and waded out to the rescue,--for\nthe money that was in it. The boat's crew elevated their trousers'\nlegs also and slided down into the water. Each of us then straddled\nthe neck of a Filipino standing in the water and was held by ankles to\nbe steadied while our biped mounts proceeded to the shore.\n\nWe were now on the ground and face to face with the situation. To give\nthe reader an idea of the actual conditions met by the first teachers\nwho went to the Islands, the following is copied from the instructions\ngiven us in Manila:\n    1. There shall be two sessions daily of all schools, and the\n    last hour of the morning session shall be devoted solely to\n    instructing the Filipino teachers.\n\n    2. In cases where teachers are sent to a town in which there\n    is no school-house, they are expected to secure the aid of the\n    people and have one built.\n\n    3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is\n    stopped.\n\n    4. All supplies must be kept under lock and key. In towns\n    where there is no case or box to lock the supplies in, and it\n    is also impossible to get the town council to furnish a case,\n    a requisition may be sent to Manila, and, if an appropriation\n    can be secured, one will be made and sent out.\n\nThus it can be easily seen that we were indeed pioneers. In many\nplaces no school-house was to be found, and in some cases it was even\ndifficult to get the town council to provide a case in which to keep\nthe supplies.\n\nThe work of the teachers was, in short; to \"make the English language\nthe basis of instruction in the public schools.\" On our arrival at\nBacalod two schools were found in progress, for some soldiers had been\ndetailed for the work here previous to our coming. One of these was\nfor boys and the other, for girls. Thus the work here had been in a\nmeasure simplified, but complications that had arisen at Talisay, one\nof the largest and richest towns on the island, demanded a change of\nteachers and the writer was assigned to the place as superintendent.\n\nHere an attempt had been made to start a school but it had failed\nignominiously and a system of education was to be put into operation\nfrom the very start.\n\nThe Filipinos are not strong advocates of co-education, so separate\nschools were to be started for the boys and the girls. The one for the\nboys was gotten well in hand before the one for the girls was\nattempted at all.\n\nA few days after reaching the town and securing a home the\npresidente of the town had it publicly announced that the following\nMonday morning at eight o'clock a public school for boys would be\nopened in a building that had been rented for the purpose by the\nmunicipal council. About the middle of the afternoon of the same day a\nman beat a little drum throughout all the streets of the town to call\nthe people out and the town clerk announced both in Spanish and in the\nnative language that this public school would begin at the time and\nplace mentioned above; that instruction would be free to all who came;\nthat the government would furnish all supplies; and that instruction\nwould be given in the English language. A native principal and\nassistants were employed and everything was ready to begin.\n\nThe official report of the result is as follows:\n    Boys' public school of Talisay, Negros, P. I., began November\n    4, 1901. Forty-three boys present at eight o'clock. Forty-one\n    of them knew \"good morning\" and \"good afternoon\" but do not\n    know the distinction between them. Two of them speak simple\n    Spanish. At eight forty-five, eight more, who had been\n    attending an early morning private school, came in together.\n\n    The books they brought were so varied and so different from\n    one another that it seemed impossible to bring any reasonable\n    degree of order out of such a chaos, and so, after struggling\n    vainly for about a week with the problem, the superintendent\n    by one fell stroke removed everything in use and put in a\n    uniform system, and from that day on the English language has\n    been the basis of instruction in the public schools of\n    Talisay. The work was of necessity very slow at first, but by\n    the end of a year two schools were going nicely and a number\n    of the brightest boys and girls had made really excellent\n    progress.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER V. - A \"BAILE.\"\n\n\nNot long after the arrival of our party at Bacalod we received an\ninvitation to a \"baile\" given in our honor by the inhabitants of\nSilay, a town some ten or twelve miles up the northern coast and one\nnoted for its social life. The invitation was accepted with pleasure,\nand about the middle of the afternoon on the day appointed we were\nclad in the immaculate white of the tropics and steaming away up the\ncoast on board a launch sent for our conveyance. Twilight was still\nlingering on the path of day when we anchored just off shore at the\ntown. A row-boat containing the officials of the city came out to meet\nus and, in due season, we were ushered into a spacious drawing-room\nfilled almost to overflowing with the \u00e9lite of the town. The \u00e9lite of\ntowns in the Philippines speak Spanish, and, as only one or two of our\nparty could at that time boast of more than a formal acquaintance with\nthe Castilian tongue, the exchange of ideas that evening between us\nand the Filipinos was of necessity not very rapid.\n\nThe necessity of easy communication between us was rendered somewhat\nless indispensable by the announcement of supper as soon as we were\nrested from our trip. When we had taken our places at the table a\nyoung Filipino about twenty-five years of age arose and gave a lengthy\ntoast to the recent union of the Philippines with the United States.\n\nBut as we Americans were unable to scale the dizzy heights of his\nclimaxes or sink to the depths of his pathos, we forewent the\npleasures of his oratory and turned our attention to the savory odor\nof lamb, chicken, and roast pig that came slyly stealing up our\nnostrils to send us nerve dispatches about the gastronomic delights of\nour not far distant future.\n\nAt last the toast was ended and the world-wide soup ushered in a long\ntrain of things good to eat, served in a style better fitted to the\ndelights of the appetite than to the formalities of dinners, for, as\nsoon as the pleasant task of one dish was completed by any one, the\nnext was served him at once regardless of the progress made by the\nothers at the table.\n\nThe last course was dulce. The new-comers to the Philippines will\nnot be long in making the acquaintance of this dish, and at all\nmeetings, both public and private, where eatables are served, it\nperforms an important part. It is anything sweet, and it may vary all\nthe way from an india-rubber-like black mixture of cocoanut milk and\ndirty sugar to a really toothsome and respectable confection. No\nmatter of what materials a dish is composed, just so long as it is\nsweet, it is dulce.\n\nAfter paying our respects to this last course, we arose from the table\nand entered a great rectangular room from the center of whose ceiling\nhung a large glass chandelier, a mass of shimmering crystals. In the\nchairs around the room were the wealth, the youth, and the beauty of\nthe town.\n\nThe first and also the last number of every Filipino dance of any\nformality is the \"rigodon.\" The dancers are arranged in a square, or\nquadrangle according to the number participating, and are then led\nthrough a tangled maze of figures that so utterly bewilders the novice\nthat he sinks into his chair at the end of the dance wondering how it\nall came to pass.\n\nWe Americans breathed a sigh of relief when the \"rigodon\" ended, and\nmustered fresh courage for social conquests in the waltz that was now\nbreathing forth from the trembling strings. My companion in the first\ndance had been the young lady by whose side I had sat at dinner. But\nit now became necessary to search for another, so I prudently waited\nto see how partners were chosen, and made no mistake when a few\nmoments later I faced one of the most luscious looking se\u00f1oritas on\nthe opposite side of the room and offered her my arm. My eyes must\nhave told the story that my lips could not utter in Spanish, for she\nsmiled upon me sweetly, arose, and put her hand upon my shoulder. My\narm encircled her waist and I began to waltz. Unfortunately my\ncompanion did not follow, but began to hop up and down in a manner\nmost distressing. Supposing the attack to be only temporary, I paused\nand, much to my relief, she soon showed signs of recovery; and in the\ncourse of time she came to a standstill looking up into my face in an\ninquiring sort of way, apparently wondering why St. Vitus had not paid\nhis respects to me also. A second attempt to follow the music met with\nresults similar to the first, and during the third attempt, which\nseemed to be trembling on the verge of a failure, St. Vitus let go my\ncompanion and seized me with such vigor that she, who was small even\nfor a Filipino, was gathered up bodily and taken around the room at\nsuch a pace that her toes touched the floor only at far distant\nintervals.\n\nAt this point my devotion to the shrine of Terpsichore ceased from\nforce of circumstances and I seated myself in one of the most\ncomfortable chairs in sight that I might carry out a previously formed\nplan to study the Filipino somewhat critically as he appears in\nsociety.\n\nThe first thing that impressed me as the dancers passed up and down\nthe room was the flash of diamonds. Nearly every woman in the room had\non a brooch that flashed the colors of the rainbow at every turn.\n\nAlmost all of them wore one or more rings that showed up brilliantly\nunder the chandelier. Many of the men too, especially the young men,\nwore gems that appeared to be exquisite. A closer inspection showed\nthat some of the gems had flaws and others were of a poor color, but\nno one would have denied that, taken as a whole, it was a really\nbeautiful display.\n\nThe dress of the ladies was richly colored. Many of their skirts were\nof silk covered with hand embroidered flowers, and their filmy pina\nwaists and broad collar pieces were rich with needle-work. They all\nwore a kind of heelless velvet slipper, very common as a dress shoe in\nthe Philippines, or high-heeled patent leather shoes with neatly\nfitting black stockings.\n\nThe men were dressed in white coats and white pantaloons or black\ncoats and white pantaloons. White shirts and collars, together with\nall sorts and styles of cravats and low-cut patent leather shoes with\nhighly colored socks completed their dress.\n\nIt was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money;\nthat they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a\ntable loaded with good things was a fact to which all of us were\nenthusiastic witnesses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VI. - A SKETCH OF LIFE IN THE PHILIPPINES.\n\n\nHouse-keeping in the Philippines presents some interesting phases. Our\nclub of American officials decided to run a mess, so we employed a\ncook and a house boy, then each of us provided himself with a personal\nservant, making a total of six servants for four men--it takes about\nthis proportion of servants to live in any sort of comfort in the\nPhilippines--and launched ourselves boldly upon the sea of domestic\neconomy. But there were shoals ahead of us, for the question of\nregulating servants is one of no small importance in the Philippines,\nand one of its most disadvantageous features is the long chain of\ndependents that usually attends it.\n\nWe gave the cooks so much a day with which to buy supplies in the\nlocal market, for our own table, making him render a daily list of\nexpenditures, and a fixed amount besides to purchase rice and fish for\nhimself and the other servants. Of course, if they wished to vary\ntheir diet and get chicken and fresh pork, which could be had at far\ndistant intervals, it was wholly a matter of their option, but the\nallowance was made on the basis of so much rice and fish a day for\neach. This allowance was about fifteen cents a day in Spanish coin per\nservant.\n\nThus far all was well. We had agreed to give the cook eight dollars a\nmonth in Spanish money, thinking that good wages would procure good\nservice, but the visions of affluence that floated before him on such\nfloods of wealth were so alluring that they drew him from the kitchen\nto the cooler veranda. In less than a week he had employed an\nassistant at four dollars a month; in less than another week that\nassistant had employed him an assistant at two dollars a month; in\nless than another week that assistant to the assistant had employed\nhim an assistant at the princely salary of fifty cents a month; and\nfrom fear that the chain of dependents would end only by our having\nthe whole Filipino race attached to our culinary force, we broke up\nhouse-keeping and went boarding again, choosing that as the less of\nthe two evils.\n\nOur house furnishings were almost wholly Philippine. The table ware\nand the food on the table came from the ends of the earth. The knives\nand forks were made in Germany, the plates were manufactured in\nEngland, the glass ware and table cloth, in the United States. The\noatmeal and flour came from the United States also. The butter came\nfrom Australia, the rice from China, the salt from Russia, and the\nother eatables from sources about as various as their separate names.\n\nSwitzerland furnished the condensed milk and Illinois the canned\ncream. Nearly all of the canned fruit bore labels from Spain.\n\nThus it can easily be seen that life in the Philippines, if lived\naccording to American ideals, is dependent upon a highly developed and\nhighly complex commerce. However, the difficulties of transportation\nand the restriction of large stocks of merchandise to Manila and some\nhalf a dozen other towns, make so great a difference between country\nlife and city life that a short comparison of the two will not be out\nof place, and life in Manila may well be taken as being fairly typical\nof the latter.\n\nLife in Manila is pleasant, but expensive. It is pleasant from the\nfact that it is not only the capital but also metropolis of the\narchipelago. Thus the combination of wealth and high official position\nhas given to Manila a society of the highest and most refined type.\n\nThe process of beautifying and improving the city which is constantly\ngoing on bids fair to give us at no distant day a city of which we may\nwell be proud.\n\nBut let him who intends living well in Manila on a small income bid\nfarewell at once to so idylic a dream, for it costs much to live well\nthere. In the city of Manila one can get almost anything he wishes,\nbut it must be paid for at the price it commands. Especially in the\ncase of eatables, this price is by no means small, because to the\nfirst cost of articles must in most cases be added the expense of\ndistant shipment from American, European, or Australian ports, and not\ninfrequently the cost of long refrigeration must also be taken into\nconsideration. But, expensive though it is, it is very pleasant to\nlive there and those who have once enjoyed it often wish again to\nquaff the cup of its delights.\n\nIn strong contrast to this pleasant life is the life of the quiet\nlittle hamlet away in the distant islands. Indeed, the Filipino from\nthe distant town, who by some good fortune has been to Manila, or, by\na coup de main, has studied in one of the Manila colleges, is looked\nup to in a true hero-worshiping attitude by all who either know him or\nhear of his fame. Life in such a place is one long state of harmless\ninactivity. Not a wave of trouble from the great outer world ever\ndisturbs its peaceful repose. One lounges forever in an air of\nindolent ease and extreme aversion to anything approaching what might\nbe called a respectable effort.\n\nOne arises in the morning about the time the sun's first rays silver\nthe top leaves of the cocoanut trees and then stirs around until nine\nor ten o'clock, when it is found expedient to avoid a further exposure\nto the sun. From then until about five o'clock in the afternoon it is\nbest to take things as they come, even though one of those things be a\nFilipino dinner. But then you may have your vehiclo attached to a\nyoung bull with a ring in his nose and go for a drive. If it is the\ndry season you will probably enjoy the drive unless you object to the\nfrequent clouds of dust swept along by the evening wind. If it is in\nthe rainy season your pleasure will depend to a considerable extent\nupon how wet you get; but, whether the season be wet or dry, your\npleasure will be regulated largely by the state of harmony existing\nbetween the driver and the bull.\n\nIn these quiet secluded nooks successive generations of Filipinos are\nborn, reared, grow old and die in an even chain of events broken only\nby the occasional erection of a new grass house on the identical spot\nwhere its predecessors have stood for ages. The son lives in the house\nof his father, cultivates the same few square feet of soil planted in\nedible roots, climbs the same cocoanut trees, follows the same winding\npath down to the stream, pounds rice in the same mortar and with the\nsame stick that his ancestors have used from time unremembered, and,\nin case of illness, curls up on a grass mat in a corner of the room\nuntil he dies or by some good fortune recovers. Beyond this narrow\nhorizon he never looks. So narrow and contracted is the life that the\nlanguages of two towns a few miles apart are so different that one\nwould scarcely recognize them as belonging to the same race of people.\n\nSuch are the two extremes of life in our new far Eastern provinces:\nthe one is active, progressive, and cosmopolitan; the other, inactive,\ndecadent, and narrow; but, whether one enjoys the first or endures the\nsecond, there comes to him after leaving a longing to lounge again in\ntropic airs and listen to the lullaby of the winds among the palms.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VII. - THE FILIPINO AT HOME.\n\n\nAs one enters a Filipino sitting-room for the first time, there is one\nfeature in the arrangement of the furniture that impresses itself upon\nhim at once, and it may be stated without fear of serious\ncontradiction that this same peculiar feature in its arrangement will\ncontinue to face him, as he enters different homes, about as certainly\nas he crosses the threshold.\n\nThe arrangement referred to is that of one large mirror, one settee,\nand some ten or a dozen chairs that appear to have had a certain\norderly affection for one another. The mirror is hung upon one of the\nlarge interior parts of the house about four feet above the floor. The\nwooden houses in the Philippines are built by setting large posts\nupright into the ground, extending into the air from twenty to thirty\nfeet. Cross timbers are fastened to these upright posts about eight or\nten feet above the ground and then not sawed off even with the posts,\nbut allowed to extend beyond them each way. The framework of the house\nis built upon these extending cross timbers, a style of building by\nwhich these large upright posts are left standing out on the inside of\nthe room from one to three feet from the walls. It is on that one of\nthese posts most nearly opposite the door that the mirror always finds\nits place. Immediately beneath the mirror is the settee; and the\nchairs are arranged in two parallel lines facing one another and at\nright angles with the ends of the settee. However odd this arrangement\nmay appear to one when he first enters a Filipino drawing-room, there\nare two things to be said in its favor. In the first place, it places\nyou face to face with the person with whom you are conversing so that\nyou can watch him,--a matter of no small moment in the Philippines. In\nthe next place, it enables you to give one of the young ladies a\nsheep's-eye in the mirror while the others present are left where\nMoses was in our much abused conundrum.\n\nThe size of the residence and the quality of its furnishings depends\nupon the wealth of the owner. But there is so vast a difference\nbetween the mode of life of the highest class and the tao, or lowest\nclass, that it is well to speak of them separately, and the great\nmiddle class of Filipinos can easily be imagined to occupy the\nintervening ground.\n\nThe rich Filipino's house is usually of wood built upon a wall of\nstone or brick from ten to fifteen feet high. The floors are kept\nhighly polished in his hallway, dressing-room, and bed-rooms. There\nare, of course, no fire-places in any of the rooms, but on some\noccasions something is needed to dry the rain-soaked atmosphere, for\neven in the dry season it has been seen to rain for five successive\ndays and nights without the cessation of a moment.\n\nA long chain of dependents is attached to the household of the rich\nFilipino. The master has his special body servant to be present at all\ntimes to do his master's bidding, in short, to be the visible\nmechanism of his master's volition. So, too, the lady of the house has\nher servant woman to do the slightest bidding of her ladyship. Then\nthere is the cook who is almost invariably a man, a house boy or two,\nand the coachman. These functionaries, with their assistants and\nassistants to the assistants, together with a servant or two for the\nexclusive service of the children, complete the economic household.\n\nSuch a family has an abundance of rice and wheat bread, also of\nchicken and fish with occasional fresh beef. They have also a good\ndeal of dulce. They regularly serve wine and frequently serve beer\non their tables.\n\nIn strong contrast with this mode of life is that of the tao. His\ndiet consists almost wholly of rice and small uncleaned fish boiled\ntogether. As a rule knife, fork, plate, and spoon find no place in his\nhousehold. The rice and fish are boiled in a pot and then allowed to\ncool in the same vessel or poured out to cool in a large earthen or\nwooden bowl. Then Mr. Tao together with Mrs. Tao and all the young\nTaos squat on their heels around the mixture and satisfy that\nintangible thing called the appetite. They do not use chop sticks as\nthe Chinese do, but the rice and fish are caught in a hollow formed by\nthe first three fingers of the right hand. The thumb is then placed\nbehind the mass. It is raised up and poised before the mouth, with a\nskill coming from the evolution of ages, when a contraction of the\nmuscles of the thumb throws the mass into the mouth with a skill that\nis marvelous to any but a Filipino. To judge from the most reliable\ninformation, the poorest class do not have an abundance of food,\nalthough it would seem that such a condition of things would be\nwell-nigh impossible. However, in a census of one hundred school\nchildren there were found six boys and four girls who declared that\nthey had never had enough to eat, and the native teacher stated that\nthis was probably true.\n\nThe wide gulf between the tao and the rich man is filled by the\ngreat middle class of Filipinos.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VIII. - VISIT TO A LEPER COLONY.\n\n\nNot far from our town was a leper colony and the first Saturday that\ncould be spared was set aside for a trip to the place. It happened\nthat none of the other Americans were at leisure on this particular\nmorning, but, rather then delay the trip or miss it altogether, the\nwriter, armed with a revolver, started out alone.\n\nThe road had been described so accurately by one who was supposed to\nknow it that it was deemed well-nigh impossible to miss the way. The\nmain highway was followed to the point where the by-path supposed to\nlead to the settlement turned off through some bamboo thickets and a\nlow tropical wood. This path led straight away towards the sea-coast\nwhere the houses of the colony were said to stand in a cocoanut grove\nby the beach.\n\nUpon arriving at the settlement, a very inhospitable reception was\nreceived from a mangy cur that growled and showed a very uninviting\nset of sharp, white teeth behind his snarling lips. The growling of\nthe dog had attracted the attention of an old man who, with age-bent\nback, was pounding rice in a mortar about fifty yards away. He turned\nslowly around and, upon seeing an intruder into the primitive quiet of\nthe place, gave a sharp, far-reaching call. The sound had scarcely\nrung through the grove when from about a dozen of the little grass\nhouses dotted here and there fifteen or twenty men armed with bolos\ncame out and gathered around the old man. A sense of my danger flashed\nupon me. Three miles from town and alone in a tropical jungle, I could\nbe almost instantly overcome by this band of bolo-men, and the only\nreport that would ever reach my people would be that I had\n\"disappeared.\" Of course, attack was by no means certain, but the\npotentiality of the situation was thrilling. A drawn revolver and the\ngleaming of its shining barrel had the effect of stopping the men, who\nseemed to be hesitating as to a course of action, until a somewhat\ndignified retreat was made to an open space in the rear from where a\nless dignified and a more hasty retreat began which did not stop short\nof Bacalod.\n\nEnough had been seen, however, even in this short visit, to give\nconvincing proof that the settlement visited was no colony of lepers;\nso, that afternoon two servant boys being taken as guides and\ninterpreters, another attempt was made to reach the goal desired.\n\nThis attempt was successful, and, after about two hours of walking, a\nlittle cluster of grass huts snugly hidden by the sea-coast came into\nview. As we approached, one would have thought it a gala-day. Some few\nchildren, apparently from six to thirteen years of age, almost wholly\nnude, were romping and playing in the open space around which the huts\nstood, and no one would ever have thought that any cloud so horrible\nas leprosy could hover over a place apparently so happy.\n\nBy the side of the path as we passed was a man and his wife setting\nout potato plants. His hands were so puffed and his fingers so short\nthat he could scarcely use them, but he was working along as best he\ncould. His wife's feet were so swollen and twisted that she walked\nonly with the greatest difficulty. We passed them by and entered the\nopen space above referred to.\n\nThe children now saw us, and those of them who could darted away like\nfrightened rabbits, each to his own burrow. An old man who was sitting\nin the warm afternoon sun on the little bamboo platform before his hut\nwas aroused from his lethargic repose by the scampering away of the\nchildren. He arose, trembling upon his tottering limbs, all drawn and\ntwisted, and hobbled away into his hut.\n\nThe children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at\nthe doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of\nthe settlement. In a few moments we were surrounded by a circle of\nhuman beings at once so repulsive and so pitiable that its graphic\nvividness can never be accurately portrayed.\n\nThe old man referred to above, having put on a pair of snow-white\npantaloons, appeared now at the doorway of his hut, followed a few\nmoments later by his wife who had evidently clothed herself in the\nbest raiment she had. At a call from the old man, all the men, women,\nand children in the settlement came out of their huts and stood in a\nline before us. The old man was spokesman and in his native visayan\ntongue made a heart-rending appeal for aid which we were powerless to\ngive. Attention was called to a leper woman, apparently about\ntwenty-five years of age, whose face had been attacked by the disease\nand whose appearance was truly pathetic. Upon her hip was a child\nabout a year and a half old and, strange to say, the child showed as\nyet no signs whatever of the disease.\n\nWhat an indissoluble enigma is life! Here in a little cluster of grass\nhuts in a secluded nook of a secluded island of an all but secluded\narchipelago was gathered together a little community of wretched\nnatives, driven by their loathsomeness from association with others\neven of the same half-savage race. Yet here, men and women loved and\nwere married, by mutual trust if not by law, and children were born of\nthe union to live forever under the unspeakable horror that\novershadowed the unfortunate parents. Love, hatred, sorrow, and\njoy--every passion that enters into the complex structure of the human\nheart even here, in this scene of sadness and despair, was playing\napparently as freely as where misfortune and disease had never crossed\nthe portals of life.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER IX. - A \"HIKE.\"\n\n\nWe were lounging lazily in our hammocks at Jimamaylan one evening in\nApril. Supper was just ended, and the soldiers in the post were\ncollected in groups here and there spinning yarns to pass away the\ntime, when a Filipino clad only in a loin cloth came down the street\nat a steadily swinging run and stopped in front of the sentry. He\nbrought the announcement that a band of ladrones had just burned a\nsugar mill and were advancing to sack a barrio about fifteen miles\naway.\n\nThe invitation of the commanding officer to go on a \"hike\" was eagerly\naccepted, and, in ten minutes after the message was given, the troops\nwere on the march followed by two adventurous pedagogues.\n\nDarkness was just closing in as we left the town, but a resplendent\ntropic moon soon made the night almost as brilliant as the day. The\ntrail we followed led over rough and rocky country. Sometimes for a\ndistance of a mile or more we passed over barren wastes of volcanic\nslag poured out in anger by some peak whose convulsions have long\nsince ceased. Again we would descend into a tropical jungle from the\ndense foliage of which the ladrones could have leaped at any moment,\nhad they known of our coming, and annihilated our little band. We\nforded rapid streams with the water at our breasts, and halted only\nonce in that rapid march of fifteen miles.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the town we met a man who was standing\nguard against a surprise by the ladrones. Nothing could well have been\nmuch more grotesque and nothing could much better illustrate the\nabsolutely primitive condition of the Filipinos in the interior of the\nislands than the appearance of this guard. A pair of knee pants, a\nconical grass hat, and a hemp shirt formed his entire apparel. A long\nflat wooden shield, a bolo, and a long bamboo spear with a sharp,\nflat, iron point, completed his equipment for battle.\n\nHere stood the first and the twentieth centuries side by side. The\nFilipino who had advanced only a stage beyond the condition of\nprimitive man with his knife, spear, and wooden shield, stood side by\nside with the American soldier, a representative of modern life with\nhis magazine rifle, his canteen, his knapsack,--with every article of\nhis clothing made to give him the highest possible efficiency as the\nunit of a military organization.\n\nA few yards farther on we met another guard equipped similarly to the\nfirst. Upon reaching the town, news had just been received that a\ndetachment of troops from another post had intercepted the ladrones\nand fought a skirmish with them. The ladrones had escaped and we set\nout in pursuit of them on a chase wilder than a Quixotic dream. We\nwound our way into the mountains behind the town, inquiring at every\ngrass hut we passed whether the band of ladrones had passed that way,\nbut only once was even a trace of them found. Then it was learned that\nat a certain place they had separated into groups of three or four and\ngone glimmering through the dream of things that were. This place was\nin a secluded nook of the mountains where in years gone by some\nadventurous Spaniard had erected a primitive water mill to grind his\nsugar-cane. We had now marched about twenty miles and the feet of the\npedagogues were a mass of blisters. They had reached the point where\nthat form of military maneuvering called \"hiking\" ceased to possess\nany alluring charms. So a native was persuaded to come out of his lone\nmountain hut and hitch up his carabao and cart. He was then made to\nget on the carabao's back, while the aforesaid pedagogues lay down on\nthe sugar-cane pulp that had been put into the body of the cart, and\nthe driver was instructed to start for the post we had left hours\nbefore, and not to stop until he got there. Being uncertain but that\nsome of the ladrones would learn of our having left the body of troops\nand would try the metal of our steel, we at first agreed that neither\nof us should go to sleep, but it was later decided that probably the\ndriver had no greater desire to cross the Styx than his passengers had\nand that in case of danger he would awaken us, so both took a revolver\nin each hand, stretched out supinely and went to sleep.\n\nSuch a sleep! The rough jolting of the cart over an almost impassable\nroad was never enough to break the spell of slumber. When we awoke the\nblazing tropic sun was past the midday mark of morning, shining full\ninto our unprotected and well-nigh blistered faces.\n\nA pack of dogs were heralding our approach to a little village at the\nfoot of the mountains where ponies were procured to take us back to\nthe post."

                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently\nno time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth dimension of Space\nas a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house\nbecame quite quiet.\n\nOn reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up\nagainst a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realize\nhis position. Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\nhundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the\nDowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone\ninto hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains on\none of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who\nhad been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr\nto nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair\nby the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six\nweeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become\nreconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that\nnotorious sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible\nnight when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his\ndressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and\nconfessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox\nout of \u00a350,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card, and swore that\nthe ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back\nto him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because\nhe had seen a green hand tapping at the window-pane, to the beautiful\nLady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round\nher throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin,\nand who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of the\nKing's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he went\nover his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as\nhe recalled to mind his last appearance as \"Red Reuben, or the Strangled\nBabe,\" his d\u00e9but as \"Guant Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,\"\n\nand the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely\nplaying ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And\nafter all this some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him\nthe Rising Sun Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite\nunbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever been treated in this\nmanner. Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance, and remained till\ndaylight in an attitude of deep thought.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III\n\n\nThe next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed\nthe ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. \"I have\nno wish,\" he said, \"to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say\nthat, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,\"--a very just remark,\nat which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.\n\n\"Upon the other hand,\" he continued, \"if he really declines to use the\nRising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him. It\nwould be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside\nthe bedrooms.\"\n\nFor the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the\nblood-stain on the library floor. This certainly was very strange, as\nthe door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept\nclosely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a\ngood deal of comment. Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red,\nthen it would be vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came\ndown for family prayers, according to the simple rites of the Free\nAmerican Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright\nemerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party\nvery much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening. The\nonly person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia, who,\nfor some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the\nsight of the blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was\nemerald-green.\n\nThe second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in\nthe hall. Rushing down-stairs, they found that a large suit of old\narmour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone\nfloor, while seated in a high-backed chair was the Canterville ghost,\nrubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face. The\ntwins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged\ntwo pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained\nby long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United\nStates Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in\naccordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost\nstarted up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a\nmist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so\nleaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase\nhe recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of\ndemoniac laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely\nuseful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single\nnight, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French\ngovernesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly\nlaughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and\nrang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door\nopened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown. \"I am\nafraid you are far from well,\" she said, \"and have brought you a bottle\nof Doctor Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a\nmost excellent remedy.\" The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at\nonce to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an\naccomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family\ndoctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's\nuncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps,\nhowever, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself\nwith becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep\nchurchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.\n\nOn reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the\nmost violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross\nmaterialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what\nreally distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit\nof mail. He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by\nthe sight of a Spectre in armour, if for no more sensible reason, at\nleast out of respect for their natural poet Longfellow, over whose\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\nhour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides it was his own suit.\n\nHe had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament, and had\nbeen highly complimented on it by no less a person than the Virgin Queen\nherself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely overpowered\nby the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen\nheavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees severely, and\nbruising the knuckles of his right hand.\n\nFor some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of\nhis room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.\n\nHowever, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to\nmake a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his\nfamily. He selected Friday, August 17th, for his appearance, and spent\nmost of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in\nfavour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet\nfrilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards evening a\nviolent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was\njust such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to\nmake his way quietly to Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the\nfoot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\nof low music. He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville\nblood-stain by means of Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent. Having reduced\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and\nhis wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead,\nwhile he hissed into her trembling husband's ear the awful secrets of\nthe charnel-house. With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made\nup his mind. She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and\ngentle. A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more\nthan sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the\ncounterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins, he was quite\ndetermined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be done was, of\ncourse, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling\nsensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each\nother, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse,\ntill they became paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw off the\nwinding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white, bleached bones and\none rolling eyeball, in the character of \"Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's\nSkeleton,\" a r\u00f4le in which he had on more than one occasion produced a\ngreat effect, and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of\n\"Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.\"\n\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the\nlight-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves\nbefore they retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still,\nand, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the\nwindow-panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family\nslept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\ncould hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States. He\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his\nmurdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like\nan evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.\n\nOnce he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only\nthe baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange\nsixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\nin the midnight air. Finally he reached the corner of the passage that\nled to luckless Washington's room. For a moment he paused there, the\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's\nshroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was\ncome. He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had\nhe done so than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid\nhis blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was\nstanding a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous\nas a madman's dream! Its head was bald and burnished; its face round,\nand fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\nfeatures into an eternal grin. From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\nlight, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like\nto his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form. On its breast\nwas a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of\nshame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime,\nand, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\n\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's\njack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler. Once in the\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small\npallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes. After a time, however,\nthe brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to\ngo and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight. Accordingly,\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling\nthat, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid\nof his new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins. On reaching\nthe spot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had\nevidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from\nits hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it\nwas leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable\nattitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his\nhorror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a\nrecumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity\nbed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow\nturnip lying at his feet! Unable to understand this curious\ntransformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there,\nin the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:--\n        +------------------------------------+\n        |         YE OTIS GHOSTE             |\n        | Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook, |\n        |    Beware of Ye Imitationes.       |\n        |   All others are counterfeite.     |\n        +------------------------------------+\nThe whole thing flashed across him. He had been tricked, foiled, and\nout-witted! The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his\ntoothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his\nhead, swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\nschool, that, when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds\nof blood would be wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.\n\nHardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of\na distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh,\nand waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\nreason, did not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back\nto his room, thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose. There he\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was\nexceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which this oath\nhad been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second time. \"Perdition\nseize the naughty fowl,\" he muttered, \"I have seen the day when, with my\nstout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow\nfor me an 'twere in death!\" He then retired to a comfortable lead\ncoffin, and stayed there till evening.\n\n\nCHAPTER: IV\n\n\nThe next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were\ncompletely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five\ndays he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point\nof the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want\nit, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a\nlow, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating\nthe symbolic value of sensuous phenomena. The question of phantasmic\napparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a\ndifferent matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large\noriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every month, and he\ndid not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is\nquite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand,\nhe was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.\n\nFor the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as\nusual between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible\nprecaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots,\ntrod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large\nblack velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for\noiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good\ndeal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of\nprotection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he\nslipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a\nlittle humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see\nthat there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a\ncertain degree, it served his purpose. Still in spite of everything he\nwas not left unmolested. Strings were continually being stretched across\nthe corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion,\nwhile dressed for the part of \"Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley\nWoods,\" he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide,\nwhich the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry\nChamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged\nhim, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and\nsocial position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the\nnext night in his celebrated character of \"Reckless Rupert, or the\nHeadless Earl.\"\n\nHe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in\nfact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means\nof it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord\nCanterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome\nJack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\ndown the terrace at twilight. Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\nLord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken\nheart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it\nhad been a great success. It was, however an extremely difficult\n\"make-up,\" if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more\nscientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three\nhours to make his preparations. At last everything was ready, and he was\nvery pleased with his appearance. The big leather riding-boots that went\nwith the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\nfind one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite\nsatisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting\nand crept down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins,\nwhich I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of\nthe colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make\nan effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water\nfell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his\nleft shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed. The shock to his\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\ncould go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold. The only\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\nhad not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences\nmight have been very serious.\n\nHe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,\nand contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in\nlist slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\ndraughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the\ntwins. The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September. He\nhad gone down-stairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that\nthere, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing\nhimself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of\nthe United States Minister and his wife which had now taken the place of\nthe Canterville family pictures. He was simply but neatly clad in a long\nshroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip\nof yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In\nfact, he was dressed for the character of \"Jonas the Graveless, or the\nCorpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,\" one of his most remarkable\nimpersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to\nremember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their\nneighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a quarter-past two o'clock in\nthe morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring. As\nhe was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any\ntraces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a\ndark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads,\nand shrieked out \"BOO!\" in his ear.\n\nSeized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural,\nhe rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him\nthere with the big garden-syringe, and being thus hemmed in by his\nenemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the\ngreat iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to\nmake his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own\nroom in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.\n\nAfter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins\nlay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\nservants, but it was of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings\nwere so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed\nhis great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had\nbeen engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized a wonderful\nclam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse\neuchre, poker, and other American national games, and Virginia rode\nabout the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire,\nwho had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville\nChase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in\nfact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who,\nin reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best\ncongratulations to the Minister's worthy wife.\n\nThe Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the\nhouse, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let\nmatters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the\nyoung Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had\nonce bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice\nwith the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the\nfloor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state that, though\nhe lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but\n\"Double Sixes.\" The story was well known at the time, though, of course,\nout of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt\nwas made to hush it up, and a full account of all the circumstances\nconnected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle's\nRecollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends. The ghost, then,\nwas naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence\nover the Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his\nown first cousin having been married en secondes noces to the Sieur de\nBulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are\nlineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to\nVirginia's little lover in his celebrated impersonation of \"The Vampire\nMonk, or the Bloodless Benedictine,\" a performance so horrible that when\nold Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in\nthe year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which\nculminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after\ndisinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and\nleaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment,\nhowever, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the\nlittle Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal\nBedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.\n\n\nCHAPTER: V\n\n\nA few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out\nriding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting\nthrough a hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go\nup by the back staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past\nthe Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied\nshe saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother's maid, who\nsometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend\nher habit. To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville\nGhost himself! He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of\nthe yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing\nmadly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his hand, and his\nwhole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so forlorn, and so\nmuch out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea\nhad been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity,\nand determined to try and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so\ndeep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she\nspoke to him.\n\n\"I am so sorry for you,\" she said, \"but my brothers are going back to\nEton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy\nyou.\"\n\n\"It is absurd asking me to behave myself,\" he answered, looking round in\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,\n\"quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and\nwalk about at night, if that is what you mean. It is my only reason for\nexisting.\"\n\n\"It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very\nwicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had\nkilled your wife.\"\n\n\"Well, I quite admit it,\" said the Ghost, petulantly, \"but it was a\npurely family matter, and concerned no one else.\"\n\n\"It is very wrong to kill any one,\" said Virginia, who at times had a\nsweet puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.\n\n\"Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very\nplain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about\ncookery. Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent\npricket, and do you know how she had it sent to table? However, it is\nno matter now, for it is all over, and I don't think it was very nice of\nher brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.\"\n\n\"Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost--I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry? I\nhave a sandwich in my case. Would you like it?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you,\nall the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\nvulgar, dishonest family.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Virginia, stamping her foot, \"it is you who are rude, and\nhorrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the\npaints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain\nin the library. First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and\nI couldn't do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the\nchrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese\nwhite, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing\nto look at, and not at all easy to paint. I never told on you, though I\nwas very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for\nwho ever heard of emerald-green blood?\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" said the Ghost, rather meekly, \"what was I to do? It is\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother\nbegan it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I\nshould not have your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of\ntaste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest\nin England; but I know you Americans don't care for things of this\nkind.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\nand improve your mind. My father will be only too happy to give you a\nfree passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind,\nthere will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are\nall Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\nhave a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family ghost.\"\n\n\"I don't think I should like America.\"\n\n\"I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,\" said Virginia,\nsatirically.\n\n\"No ruins! no curiosities!\" answered the Ghost; \"you have your navy and\nyour manners.\"\n\n\"Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week's\nholiday.\"\n\n\"Please don't go, Miss Virginia,\" he cried; \"I am so lonely and so\nunhappy, and I really don't know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I\ncannot.\"\n\n\"That's quite absurd! You have merely to go to bed and blow out the\ncandle. It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\nchurch, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why, even\nbabies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.\"\n\n\"I have not slept for three hundred years,\" he said sadly, and\nVirginia's beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; \"for three hundred\nyears I have not slept, and I am so tired.\"\n\nVirginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like\nrose-leaves. She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked\nup into his old withered face.\n\n\"Poor, poor Ghost,\" she murmured; \"have you no place where you can\nsleep?\"\n\n\"Far away beyond the pine-woods,\" he answered, in a low, dreamy voice,\n\"there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\nsings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold crystal\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\nsleepers.\"\n\nVirginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\n\n\"You mean the Garden of Death,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth,\nwith the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have\nno yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at\npeace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of death's\nhouse, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death\nis.\"\n\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\nthere was silence. She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\n\nThen the ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of\nthe wind.\n\n\"Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?\"\n\n\"Oh, often,\" cried the little girl, looking up; \"I know it quite well.\n\nIt is painted in curious black letters, and is difficult to read. There\nare only six lines:\n    \"'When a golden girl can win\n    Prayer from out the lips of sin,\n    When the barren almond bears,\n    And a little child gives away its tears,\n    Then shall all the house be still\n    And peace come to Canterville.'\n\n\"But I don't know what they mean.\"\n\n\"They mean,\" he said, sadly, \"that you must weep with me for my sins,\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle,\nthe angel of death will have mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\ncannot prevail.\"\n\nVirginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair\nas he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes. \"I am not afraid,\" she said\nfirmly, \"and I will ask the angel to have mercy on you.\"\n\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as\nhe led her across the dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were\nbroidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back. \"Go back! little Virginia,\"\n\nthey cried, \"go back!\" but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly,\nand she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails\nand goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and\nmurmured, \"Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,\"\n\nbut the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When\nthey reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she\ncould not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly\nfading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A\nbitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her\ndress. \"Quick, quick,\" cried the Ghost, \"or it will be too late,\" and\nin a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry\nChamber was empty.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VI\n\n\nAbout ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not\ncome down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia\nanywhere. As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\nevening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all\nalarmed at first, but when six o'clock struck, and Virginia did not\nappear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for\nher, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house. At\nhalf-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\nof their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of\nexcitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly\nremembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies\npermission to camp in the park. He accordingly at once set off for\nBlackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son\nand two of the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire, who was\nperfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too,\nbut Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a\nscuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gipsies had\ngone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as\nthe fire was still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.\n\nHaving sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran\nhome, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the\ncounty, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been\nkidnapped by tramps or gipsies. He then ordered his horse to be brought\nround, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down\nto dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with a groom. He had hardly,\nhowever, gone a couple of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after\nhim, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with\nhis face very flushed, and no hat. \"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,\" gasped\nout the boy, \"but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.\n\nPlease don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year,\nthere would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me back,\nwill you? I can't go! I won't go!\"\n\nThe Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace,\nand was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down\nfrom his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, \"Well,\nCecil, if you won't go back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must\nget you a hat at Ascot.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!\" cried the little Duke, laughing,\nand they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of\nthe station-master if any one answering to the description of Virginia\nhad been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her. The\nstation-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him\nthat a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a\nhat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his\nshutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away,\nwhich he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as there was a\nlarge common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman, but\ncould get no information from him, and, after riding all over the\ncommon, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase\nabout eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found\nWashington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with\nlanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest trace of\nVirginia had been discovered. The gipsies had been caught on Brockley\nmeadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they should be late. Indeed, they had\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's disappearance, as they\nwere very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his\npark, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search.\n\nThe carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone\nover, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any\nrate, Virginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest\ndepression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they\nfound a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\nwas poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and\nhaving her forehead bathed with eau de cologne by the old housekeeper.\n\nMr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up\nsupper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one\nspoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very\nfond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the\nentreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that\nnothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in\nthe morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down\nimmediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight\nbegan to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded\nthey heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder\nshook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a\npanel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out\non the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her\nhand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs.\nOtis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with\nviolent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.\n\n\"Good heavens! child, where have you been?\" said Mr. Otis, rather\nangrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them.\n\n\"Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and\nyour mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these\npractical jokes any more.\"\n\n\"Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!\" shrieked the twins, as they\ncapered about.\n\n\"My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side\nagain,\" murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair.\n\n\"Papa,\" said Virginia, quietly, \"I have been with the Ghost. He is dead,\nand you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was\nreally sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of\nbeautiful jewels before he died.\"\n\nThe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave\nand serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a\nlighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they\ncame to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia\ntouched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves\nin a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated\nwindow. Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was\na gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone\nfloor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers\nan old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its\nreach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was\ncovered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but\na pile of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding\nher little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the\nparty looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\ndisclosed to them.\n\n\"Hallo!\" suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out\nof the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\nsituated. \"Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.\"\n\n\"God has forgiven him,\" said Virginia, gravely, as she rose to her feet,\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.\n\n\"What an angel you are!\" cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round\nher neck, and kissed her.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VII\n\n\nFour days after these curious incidents, a funeral started from\nCanterville Chase at about eleven o'clock at night. The hearse was drawn\nby eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\nnodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\npurple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville\ncoat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\nservants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully\nimpressive. Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up\nspecially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first\ncarriage along with little Virginia. Then came the United States\nMinister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the\nlast carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had\nbeen frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she\nhad a right to see the last of him. A deep grave had been dug in the\ncorner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service\nwas read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, the servants, according to an old custom\nobserved in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as\nthe coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward,\nand laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms. As\nshe did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its\nsilent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a\nnightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of the\nGarden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a\nword during the drive home.\n\nThe next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given\nto Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby\nnecklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen\nof sixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis\nfelt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"I know that in this country mortmain is held to\napply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that\nthese jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg\nyou, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you\nunder certain strange conditions. As for my daughter, she is merely a\nchild, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such\nappurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I\nmay say, is no mean authority upon Art,--having had the privilege of\nspending several winters in Boston when she was a girl,--that these gems\nare of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\nprice. Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you\nwill recognize how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\nin the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such\nvain gauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\nBritish aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who\nhave been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles\nof Republican simplicity. Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box, as a memento of\nyour unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is extremely old, and\nconsequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to\ncomply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good deal\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with medi\u00e6valism\nin any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was\nborn in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned\nfrom a trip to Athens.\"\n\nLord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister's speech,\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile,\nand when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\nsaid: \"My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky\nancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are\nmuch indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck. The jewels\nare clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough\nto take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave\nin a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. As for their being\nheirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or\nlegal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite\nunknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and\nwhen Miss Virginia grows up, I dare say she will be pleased to have\npretty things to wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the\nfurniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to\nthe ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity\nSir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he\nwas really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase.\"\n\nMr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville's refusal, and\nbegged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was\nquite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to\nretain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of\n1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's first\ndrawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the\nuniversal theme of admiration. For Virginia received the coronet, which\nis the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her\nboy-lover as soon as he came of age. They were both so charming, and\nthey loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the\nmatch, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch\nthe Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less\nthan three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to\nsay, Mr. Otis himself. Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke\npersonally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his\nown words, \"was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating\ninfluences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of\nRepublican simplicity should be forgotten.\" His objections, however,\nwere completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the\naisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his\narm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of\nEngland.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to\nCanterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over\nin the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods. There had\nbeen a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir\nSimon's tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it\nsimply the initials of the old gentleman's name, and the verse from the\nlibrary window. The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses,\nwhich she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for\nsome time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There\nthe Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her\nfeet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly\nhe threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her,\n\"Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.\"\n\n\"Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have,\" he answered, smiling, \"you have never told me what\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.\"\n\n\"I have never told any one, Cecil,\" said Virginia, gravely.\n\n\"I know that, but you might tell me.\"\n\n\"Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you. Poor Sir Simon! I owe\nhim a great deal. Yes, don't laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see\nwhat Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than\nboth.\"\n\nThe Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.\n\n\"You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,\" he murmured.\n\n\"You have always had that, Cecil.\"\n\n\"And you will tell our children some day, won't you?\"\n\nVirginia blushed.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.\n\nYet Millet would have us understand that in spite of this, the\nshepherd is performing a duty to humanity not to be underrated. The\nsheep he has so carefully and conscientiously reared will form food\nto-morrow for many a hungry town-dweller. Further, he would have us\nfollow the peasant as he closes the pen for the night and traces his\ntired steps towards his simple home in the village. The frugal and\nhard-earned meal, prepared for him by his wife, who like himself has\nhad her share of duties to occupy her during the day, is partaken of\nsurrounded by a hungry and joyous group of children. Such themes\nsuggested by the simplicity of his own life appealed to him with\nirresistible force, and it is in their portrayal that his greatness is\nmanifested.\n\nPerhaps no season of the year presented the same attraction for Millet\nas the spring. The period when all the earth after its long winter\nsleep is about to waken into new life seems to have always been a\nsource of inspiration to him. In \"The Sower\" he emphasises the fact\nthat the fruits of the harvest are not to be had without due labour\nbeing expended upon the earth. The sloping field, barren of\nvegetation, and crowned at the top with a small clump of trees, is\nbeing broken up by the distant plough drawn by two horses and guided\nby a peasant. The latter figure is one of the noblest of Millet's\ncreations. By his strained and ever-attentive attitude, by his\ncontinuous tramp over the rough and broken ground, he shows us the\nmonotony of his toil. He crosses the field in one direction, only to\nreturn at an interval of a few feet. In the foreground we have the\nsower, a middle-aged man of typical peasant type, on whose left side a\nbag of seeds is slung. With automatic precision he withdraws a\nhandful, and strews it into the furrows open to receive it. So long as\nhe continues in the same track his labour will be well performed, and\nhence his task is just as monotonous as that of his fellow-worker\nhigher up in the field. The silhouetting of these two figures against\nthe light is symbolical of the labour to be expended in life before\nresults are forthcoming.\n\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that in considering the works of\nMillet, one must not judge him from the standpoint of a mere painter.\n\nHis brush is only the means to an end, and by its means he is enabled\nto bring the fruits of his philosophic observation before us in\npermanent form. It has been charged against the \"Angelus\" that it was\nnot a remarkably fine piece of painting, that many a young artist of\nthe present generation is infinitely better equipped, technically\nspeaking, than the master who wrought this celebrated canvas. This may\nin a measure be true, but it must never be forgotten that Millet\nbrought into play exactly the means which could illustrate his meaning\nin the clearest terms. He had not intended, in painting such a\npicture, to produce a work which would astonish his fellow artists\nwith its brilliancy of handling or magnificence of colour. He wanted\nto make the beholder forget the painter and absorb the lesson. This\nquality runs right through the art of Millet, and it is from this\nstandpoint that we are obliged to weigh his merits.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE\n\n\nJean Fran\u00e7ois Millet was born on October 4, 1814, that is at the\nperiod when French art, at any rate as far as landscape painting is\nconcerned, had reached its lowest ebb. Throughout the eighteenth\ncentury the landscape painter had been hard put to make a living. The\ntaste of connoisseurs throughout the century had been for portraits\nand interiors, or for those numerous pastoral subjects which were\ncarried out with so much decorative charm by such men as Watteau and\nBoucher. Such landscape painting as existed was of the type\npopularised by Vernet; it was built upon a curious mixture of Italian\ninfluence coming from Panini and Salvator Rosa. The only evidence of\nrevolt against such a state of affairs we find in the works of Hubert\nRobert and Moreau. These two, and more especially would I direct the\nreader's attention to the latter, struggled hard to break down the\nconventionalities of the time. They endeavoured to infuse some sense\nof atmosphere into their pictures, and whilst frequently their trees\nand figures are painfully formal, they yet stand alone in the French\nschool as the pioneers of a phase of art which was to attain its\nzenith in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBut after the Revolution, and during the whole of the time that France\nwas under the domination of Napoleon, very rigid principles indeed\nwere enforced with regard to the direction that art should take. The\ninnovation which had its commencement in the reign of Louis XVI. swept\neverything before it as it gained force. Classical art and traditions\ndominated the whole French school, and no artist, however great his\nreputation, attempted for many years to swim against the stream. In\nspite of the principles of liberty and equality which were claimed for\nall under the new r\u00e9gime, a terribly strict eye was kept upon any\ninnovations which might break out in the form of a naturalistic art.\n\nThe directors of this new movement failed to see that the conditions\nwhich had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed\naway, and that the latter's supremacy was due to the fact that their\nproductions were symbolical of the loftiest thoughts of their own\nepoch. The art which expresses the ambitions and noblest thoughts of\nits time will alone endure. These expressions are not applicable to\nany other condition than those which called them forth, and hence in\nattempting to purify the rococo which had existed up to the middle of\nthe eighteenth century, by a return to classical traditions, they were\nonly copying that which their predecessors had done, and in so doing\nleft us without any original expression of their own time.\n\nInto such a condition of affairs was Millet born, and he was numbered\namongst that little band of men which included Rousseau, Corot, Dupr\u00e9,\nDiaz, and Daumier, who were to lay the foundations of the modern\nnaturalistic school. At the outset it was seemingly a hopeless\nstruggle they undertook; a struggle against prejudice and influence\nwhich was only to be brought to a victorious culmination after years\nof struggle and disappointment. Of this little band, Millet was\nperhaps the best equipped for the privations which were necessary. He\ncame of a peasant stock who inhabited Gruchy, a small village\nsituated in the commune of Gr\u00e9ville, close to Cherbourg. Grouped\nunderneath the humble roof was the grandmother, who had been left a\nwidow fifteen years before; her son, Jean Louis Nicolas Millet, and\nhis wife and eight children, of which our artist was the second. His\ngrandmother appears to have been a pious old lady, whose chief delight\nwas in her grandchildren, to whom she taught those religious\nprinciples which stood them in good stead in after life. We are told\nthat Millet's father possessed a force of character one does not often\nfind amongst men in his rank of life. He was of a contemplative\ndisposition, and had a keenly developed feeling for natural beauty. He\npossessed moreover a keen appreciation of music, which unfortunately\nhe does not appear to have had much opportunity of cultivating. His\nwife was an excellent housewife and of a religious turn of mind. The\nhouse they occupied, situated quite a short distance from the sea, was\nplaced in a tract of country which, whilst it had rugged and\npicturesque features, was not of a nature which would yield\nextraordinary results under cultivation. It was, therefore, a hard\nstruggle for existence which Millet in his first years saw going\non around him. Not that the family were any the less happy for having\nto work laboriously for their livelihood. They had been brought up\namidst such surroundings; their wants were simple and easily\ngratified, and the tranquillity of the m\u00e9nage more than\ncounterbalanced those doubtful luxuries which easier circumstances\nwould have brought their way. Throughout his life Millet maintained\nthe extreme simplicity he had seen practised in the home of his\nchildhood, and long years afterwards he was accustomed to look back\nwith pleasureable memories upon his early years.\n\nGruchy, situated in one of the wildest parts of Normandy, feels the\nfull effect of every storm which blows up from the Atlantic. There is\nnothing to shelter the exposed hamlets studded along the coast from\nthe fury of the western gale, and the rocks are but too often strewn\nwith the wrecks of vessels which have come to grief in that terrible\nsea. Millet in his youth must have witnessed many of these\ncatastrophes. Quite a number of drawings by him are extant\nrepresenting succour being extended to some vessel in difficulties, or\nthe hauling up of some wreckage on to the rocks. The studious boy\nmust have been impressed as he saw the sternness of the combat in his\nnative country between men and nature; the wind-swept fields, and\nhills bare to the point of savageness. The very trees themselves\ndwarfed and gnarled; in their struggle with the elements they have\nbeen made tough and hardy as the inhabitants of the country\nthemselves, and, stunted as they are, yet show well that they can\nresist the force of the fiercest storm. The brooding and contemplative\ncharacter of the father having descended to the son, we can quite\nimagine the effect such surroundings would have upon him. As he looked\nback in after years upon his roamings in his native country, he\nappreciated the awe-inspiring character of the scenery in which he had\nbeen born. He would doubtless recall many a walk amidst the fields\nwith the wind blowing in his face as it rushed in from the Atlantic,\nthe rain beating hard upon the freshly ploughed fields, and the\ndistant figure of the ploughman struggling hard with his team against\nthe stiff sou'wester. The great mass of vapour overhead whirled before\nthe violence of the storm, casting grey and pearly light over the\nwhole scene, whilst far away on the top of the hill a clump of trees,\nbent with their resistance to the wind, are silhouetted against the\nsky. Many a drawing of this kind we encounter in the later work of\nMillet, which shows how his thoughts harked back in certain moments to\nthe scenes he had left behind him for ever.\n\nWe know that on one or two occasions he returned to Gruchy. Once or\ntwice he had urgent business which took him back, but sometimes he\nwent with no other purpose than to renew acquaintance with the scenes\nof yore.\n\nLittle Jean Fran\u00e7ois was his grandmother's favourite. It was she who\ntaught him the names of things which surrounded him, and perhaps\ndirected his thoughts in the channels to which they were finally to be\ndevoted. Her brother Charles, who formed one of the family, used to\ntake him for walks, telling him stories on the way. Millet was\ndevotedly attached to this old man, and when at the age of seven years\nhe lost him, the gap in his life thus left made an impression upon his\nmemory never to be effaced.\n\nFive years afterwards he was placed in the hands of the vicar for the\npurpose of preparing him for his first communion. The good man seems\nto have been taken with the child; he found him so attentive to all\nnatural phenomenon which was passing around him and intelligent in an\nunusual degree. He quickly learnt a considerable amount of Latin,\nwhich introduced him to the great classics. Unfortunately for Millet,\nthe vicar accepted an offer of transference to a better parish in the\nvicinity. The boy had made such progress with his master that it was\ndecided that he should go with him to his new abode. He was, however,\nso missed in his own home, that when he came back for his first\nholidays it was decided that he should not return.\n\nHe now gave serious attention to the agricultural pursuits of his\nfather. He threw himself heartily into the work of the farm, and\nassisted in the work of sowing and harvesting, of pruning and\nthrashing according to the season. His spare time was occupied in\nreading with avidity various masterpieces of literature. The authors\nhe found at hand were such as F\u00e9n\u00e9lon and Bossuet, but he developed a\ndecided preference, which lasted till the end of his life, for Virgil\nand the Bible.\n\nIt was at this time that his taste for art began to be developed.\n\nHe drew the objects he found around him, and soon acquired sufficient\nconfidence in his skill to execute a large drawing representing two\nshepherds keeping guard over their sheep. These first efforts date\nfrom about his seventeenth year, and foretell the advent of the style\nin which he was later to become pre-eminent.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE MIGRATION TO PARIS\n\n\nHow frequently has it happened that the first years in the life of a\ngenius have been employed in labour quite different from that to which\nthey should have been directed. Such a state of affairs the more often\noccurs when the sense of duty has been strong enough to overcome\ntemporarily the inclination to pursue the natural bent. In the case of\nMillet, however, the early years which he devoted to the farm and its\npursuits were by no means wasted. It is on record that he became very\nproficient in the various duties in which he was engaged, but at the\nsame time we can be quite sure that his extraordinary faculties of\nobservation were constantly being brought into play, and the fruits of\nhis observations are to be seen in the pictures of his mature period.\n\nA considerable portion of his spare time was taken up with drawing,\nnot only the persons and objects he found around him, but also\nsubjects suggested to him by the books he was in the habit of reading.\n\nHis family, so far from throwing any obstacles in his way, encouraged\nhim. In fact it was his father who took him first to Cherbourg in\norder to show a painter of that town, named Mouchel, the early\nproducts of his son's genius. The decision at which Millet p\u00e8re had\narrived was prompted by a drawing in charcoal of an old peasant\nwalking along the road, which had struck him forcibly as being a work\nof extraordinary merit. It says much for Mouchel's breadth of mind\nthat he was equally impressed with the drawings. A man who had been\nbrought up in the school of David, and who had lived in one of the\nmost reactionary periods of French art, was hardly to be expected to\ntake kindly to a style so diametrically opposed to all the traditions\ninto which he himself had been inculcated; certainly the young\nMillet, who had now arrived at the age of eighteen, had not developed\nthe extraordinary freedom which his works of ten years later\ndemonstrate. But there was sufficient originality even in his early\ndrawings to call forth condemnation from a man who had been so\nsaturated with the teaching of David.\n\nHe prevailed upon Millet to leave his son with him, and set him to\nwork to copy many well-known works of art which he brought before his\npupil by means of engravings. Two months were spent in this way when\nnews reached Millet that his father had been seized with sudden\nillness, and he was obliged in the circumstances to return to\nGr\u00e9ville. He arrived to find the old man unconscious, and very shortly\nafterwards he died.\n\nThis misfortune awoke in Millet a sense of duty which compelled him to\ndesert his studies in Cherbourg and superintend the management of the\nfarm. For some time he devoted himself entirely to his new duties, but\nthe struggle betwixt duty and genius continued; he gave himself to his\nwork with all the energy at his disposal, but his thoughts were ever\nwandering to his art.\n\nAdded to his own inclinations, his grandmother, who perceived his\nextraordinary gifts, strongly persuaded him to devote his attention\nentirely to art, and consequently after some little time he decided to\nreturn to Cherbourg. Here he entered the studio of M. Langlois, an\nartist whose reputation in the town was considerable. Again in this\nworthy man he came in contact with a painter who had been brought up\nentirely under classical influence. Langlois, who had in his early\ndays been a pupil of Gros, had absorbed the classical tradition to\nsuch an extent as to be incapable of appreciating any other style. He\nappears to have endeavoured to mould Millet in his own method rather\nthan develop the latent genius which the latter possessed. The\nincompatibility of these two men speedily caused the younger to strike\nout in his own way. He saw more good in frequenting the museums and\nmaking copies of such works as appealed to him than in listening to\nthe advice of his teacher. All this occurred, however, without any\nbreach of friendship occurring. On the contrary, Langlois, after\nperceiving the futility of inducing his pupil to follow in his\nfootsteps, did all he could to advance his interests.\n\nBy means of his influence some of Millet's drawings were brought\nbefore the Municipal Council, and Langlois suggested that Millet\nshould be sent to Paris in order to further his development, and that\nthe Council should set aside a modest pension to meet his requirements\nin that city. The discussion appears to have been very prolonged, and\nupon the question being put to a vote it was only carried by means of\nthe casting vote of the mayor. Four hundred francs was at first\nallotted to him in this way, which was further increased shortly\nafterwards to six hundred. Such encouragement, meagre though it was,\nwas sufficient to give him a foothold in the metropolis. He left\nCherbourg in January 1837, on a cold and raw day, the snow falling\nheavily throughout the entire journey, and arrived in Paris in a very\ndisheartened condition. The miserable weather, coupled with the long\njourney in which he had had time to think of the small sum which lay\nbetween him and starvation, going to a city which he had never seen\nbefore, had all served to work upon his nerves, and he entered the\ngreat city sick at heart and very despondent.\n\nOne of the first visits he made after he was somewhat settled down in\nParis was to the Louvre. Here he was brought into contact for the\nfirst time with many masters, who were to mould his yet plastic\ntemperament into the form which enabled him to give to the world, in\nlater years, so many masterpieces. As I have said before, it was\nMantegna who first captivated him, and the influence of the mighty\nPaduan was never finally to be shaken off. Michel Angelo awed him with\nhis sublimity; his classical severity tempered with intense humanism,\nhis masculine strength, were bound to have their effect upon so\nserious a character as Millet. Strange as it may seem to those who are\nbut superficially acquainted with his art, and are only too apt to\njudge him by the influence he has had upon modern French painting, he\nwas fascinated with the antique. The traditions of Phidias and\nPraxiteles, in the form in which they had been transmitted through the\ngreatest minds of the Renaissance, were ever the factors which guided\nhim throughout his career. It was this same spirit which impelled his\nfervid admiration for Nicolas Poussin, a master who to-day is sadly\nunderrated and but little understood. It was the mysteries of line,\nthe wonders of pose and composition rather than the magic of colour\nwhich appealed to him. He had a profound admiration for the glowing\ncanvases of Titian and Rubens, but he could never overlook entirely\ntheir defects of drawing or, in the case of Rubens, the tendency to\nvulgarity. From his remarks in after years it would appear that he was\nbaffled with the mysticisms of Velazquez and Rembrandt; pure painting\nitself could never hold him. He needed to grasp the message which lay\nbehind it before he felt fully taken into the confidence of the\npainter; and as the minds of the Dutchman and the Spaniard ran in\nquite different channels to his own, they spoke with a language he\nnever understood. That he had a perceptive and critically independent\nmind may be gauged from his enthusiasm for Delacroix, whose work he\nencountered for the first time at the Luxembourg.\n\nDuring this period of study he was carefully considering under what\nmaster he should place himself. His choice unhappily fell upon\nDelaroche. To any one acquainted with the work of the latter master,\na more unsuitable selection could not have been made. Delaroche and\nthe painters who surrounded him can be appropriately described as\nconstituting the back-wash of the Empire style, which had reached its\nclimax with David. His subjects were always treated with academic\nreserve. No pyrotechnics were permitted; on the contrary, an\neverlasting and mistaken striving for finish was encouraged:\noriginality was sternly suppressed. To paint human life as it really\nwas, was too vulgar for any of the painters of this time. They held\nthe public taste enslaved for years. An innovator such as Millet was\ndestined to become found his position almost untenable. The band of\ncritics and painters formed a monopoly which it seemed almost\nimpossible to break down, and it was only after years of bitter and\ndetermined struggle that the school of nature finally routed its\nopponent.\n\nDelaroche doubtlessly found the peasant painter a little rude both in\nhis person and in his ideas about art. He paid but little attention to\nthe young man who had placed himself in his hands, and devoted all his\ntime to students who were more amenable to his influence. A\ntemperament so sensitive as Millet's was bound to notice this\nneglect, and consequently after a time he became so discouraged that\nhe ceased to frequent Delaroche's studio. Another very good reason for\nthis action was the lack of resources to continue his payments. Even\nduring the time he had been with Delaroche he lost no opportunity of\nturning a few honest francs by painting the portraits of any who could\nbe got to sit to him. Delaroche, however, had a more kindly heart than\nMillet imagined. He seems to have found out the real distress of the\nyoung artist, and to have assisted him pecuniarily in many ways, and\nthere is no doubt that he appreciated the talent of the young Norman\nmuch more than he cared to own. Many of his remarks on record would\nserve to show that Delaroche already felt that his pupil was destined\nto be one of the leaders of the movement which was finally to\noverthrow his own style, and doubtlessly felt a great admiration for a\nman who had the courage and strength to swim against rather than with\nthe current.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STRUGGLE FOR RECOGNITION\n\n\nFreed from all encumbrances save poverty, Millet was now to work out\nhis own destiny according to the dictates of his genius. He joined a\nfriend named Marolle, and the two together occupying a very small\napartment endeavoured to eke out an existence. It was only too soon\napparent that young as he was, and the taste of the public being not\nyet ready for development upon the lines his genius directed him, that\nhis livelihood could not be secured by endeavouring to sell such\nsubjects as appealed to him. In these straits he turned to\nportrait-painting, just as many great painters before and since him\nhave done. That the struggle was very keen can well be imagined by the\nfact that he was unable to obtain more than five to ten francs apiece;\nand, as commissions were very scarce, he was hard put to gain the\nmeans of subsistence. This state of affairs lasted until 1840, in\nwhich year he endeavoured to obtain admission to the Salon with two\nportraits, one of which was that of his friend. This, however, was\nrejected, and the other picture, although accepted, was unnoticed by\neither the critics or the public.\n\nHaving occasion the next year to pay a visit to Cherbourg, he felt\nobliged to report himself to the Municipal Council who had had the\ngenerosity to send him in the first place to Paris. Its worthy members\nexpressed themselves as but little satisfied with the result of their\ninvestment; they claimed that they had had as yet but little to show\nfor their money, and they suggested, partly as a means of\ndemonstrating that they had had some little return, and also, in order\nto see of what stuff their prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was made, that he should paint a\nportrait of the recently deceased mayor. As Millet had not been\npersonally acquainted with that worthy citizen, and as the only guide\nwhich could be supplied him was a portrait made in miniature when he\nwas a young man of some twenty-three or twenty-four years of age, the\ntask was by no means easy. However, the artist set to work with a\nwill, and finally accomplished the picture to his own satisfaction.\n\nUpon it being shown to the Council, one and all declared, as any one\nwith the slightest knowledge of such matters could have told them\nbefore it was commenced, that it bore not the least resemblance to the\ndefunct magistrate. They therefore demurred at the three hundred\nfrancs they had agreed to pay him for the portrait, and offered him\none-third of that amount instead. Millet was deeply offended by the\ninsult, and informed the Council that he made them a present of the\npicture.\n\nIt was during this short visit to his native country that he met his\nfirst wife, a Mlle. Ono, whose portrait he had painted. From the first\nshe was very delicate, and he lost her after much suffering, three\nyears later. His second wife was Mlle. Catherine Lemaire, who was\ndestined to be the companion of his struggles until the end of his\nlife.\n\nMeanwhile Millet was occupied with subjects which he thought would\nappeal to the general public. A number of classical pictures date from\nthis epoch. It was an endeavour on his part to fall in as far as\npossible with the current taste, and so supply means of subsistence\nfor his family. At the same time he did not neglect his favourite\nsubjects, and many are the wonderful studies of peasant life which\ndate from these years. His reputation had so far advanced that he was\noffered the position of teacher of drawing in the college at\nCherbourg. It must have been only after prolonged deliberation that he\nrefused the proffered post. Here a certain annual stipend was assured\nhim, and if it was not large in itself it would at any rate suffice to\nkeep the wolf from the door. He preferred, however, to return to Paris\nand work out his own destiny as best he might.\n\nMillet, who lived at this time in the Rue Rochechouart, began to\nsurround himself with that little group of friends who remained\nfaithful to him until the end of his career. Amongst the earliest were\nCharles Jacque and Diaz: the latter had several clients amongst the\nsmall dealers, whom he induced to visit Millet's studio and make now\nand again a small purchase.\n\nMillet now became a fairly regular contributor to the Salon, but\ngenerally sent some classical or religious picture as well as one of\nhis peasant subjects. For example, in 1848 he sent the marvellous\nstudy of \"The Winnower,\" which we all know so well, accompanied by a\ncanvas, \"The Captivity of the Jews at Babylon.\" The latter, however,\nwas so badly received that he utilised the canvas upon its return for\na large picture of a \"Shepherdess tending her Sheep.\"\n\nIn spite of the headway that he was making, the struggle for existence\nseemed keener than ever, and but for the kindness of friends he and\nhis family would frequently have actually wanted for food. A timely\nadvance of one hundred francs obtained for him from the Minister of\nFine Arts, together with a commission from the State, for which he was\npaid the sum of eighteen hundred francs, were for some time the only\nrelief he obtained from his embarrassments. That he was not particular\nas to how he earned his daily bread is apparent from the fact that he\ndid not despise an order for a shop sign for a midwife, for which he\nwas paid the miserable amount of thirty francs.\n\nThe year 1848 was not an encouraging one for a painter who was\nstanding on the threshold of his career. The whole of Europe was\nseething with revolution. A repetition of the fearful year of 1792 was\neverywhere expected. The struggle betwixt reaction and property on the\none hand, and lawlessness and revolution on the other, was being waged\nwith grim determination. The issue was for long in the balance. One\nnever knew from one day to another what was going to happen. In such a\ndeplorable state of affairs men's minds were running on politics and\nwars rather than upon art. Millet amongst the rest was called upon to\nshoulder the musket, and it can be easily imagined with what\nreluctance he did so.\n\nParis, the great centre of art, had yet not afforded him much\nencouragement. Life was dear in the big city, and surrounded on all\nsides by bricks and mortar he was not free to go out into the fields\nand study the objects which were uppermost in his mind. He resolved to\nescape from it, and once having put the plan into execution he never\nreturned.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET IN HIS MATURITY\n\n\nThe Barbizon of 1850 was a very different place from the Barbizon of\nto-day. The world fame of the men who passed a quiet and strenuous\nexistence in the little village has transformed it into a tourist\nresort, with restaurants and caf\u00e9s, the stopping-places for\nwaggonettes which in summer bring their daily load of sightseers,\neager to see the homes of the painters whose names are now household\nwords.\n\nIt would have been well-nigh impossible for the little band to have\nchosen a more suitable spot for their labours. Rousseau and Millet,\nmuch as they were drawn towards each other by the tie of a sympathetic\ndisposition and by their common interest in art, yet were widely\ndissimilar from one another in their outlook upon art and their\nmethods of worship at the common shrine. Rousseau--one can see it from\nevery picture he painted--loved with all the yearning of a passionate\nand restless temperament the inanimate in Nature. Observe with what\nfidelity he draws his trees, with what caressing tenderness his clouds\nand skies are treated; solitude appealed to him above all things, and\nif here and there he was obliged to insert a few figures to complete\nhis composition, one instinctively feels that he would rather have\nsubstituted a group of cattle or a flock of sheep. In the glades of\nthe forest, far from the busy haunts of men, with the glorious\nsunlight penetrating from above, the breeze moaning through the\nbranches, he was happy. A wild and turbulent temperament such as his\nnot infrequently discovers exquisite enjoyment amidst such perfect\ntranquillity.\n\nBarbizon, situated on the fringe of the great forest of Fontainebleau,\ntherefore, permitted Rousseau to come into daily contact with the\nscenes which so appealed to him.\n\nMillet, on the other hand, was absorbed in the peasant. The man who\ntilled the soil and raised the produce humanity requires for its\nsubsistence by the sweat of his brow; the manifold duties of the\nlabourer, his life and sorrows, appealed to him with irresistible\nforce. An unpeopled track of wild and uncultivated land would not call\nforth any emotion in him, no matter how sublime the scenery might be.\n\nThe life of the village, spreading itself into the vast and fertile\nplain behind, held him absorbed; a peasant himself and living amongst\nthe people he so loved, he was in a position to bring before an\nunthinking world the poignant monotony of their useful lives.\n\nUpon their first arrival at Barbizon, the two artists put up at a\nsmall inn, working all day in a tiny place they had rented from some\npeasants and fitted up as a studio. The inconveniences of this\narrangement were soon apparent, and shortly afterwards Millet took a\nsmall house which was destined to be his abode for the remainder of\nhis life; an old barn in the immediate vicinity meanwhile provided him\nwith an excellent studio.\n\nFrom this period onward we must date the greatest productions of the\nmaster, the works which have induced more thought than those of any\nother peasant painter. A peasant among peasants, his life was of the\nmost rigid simplicity. Behind his little abode a large garden\nstretched away almost to the fringe of the forest itself, and here he\nwas accustomed to work every morning, growing a portion of the food\nnecessary to the sustenance of his family. The afternoon he devoted to\npainting, whilst the evening was given over to intercourse with his\nlittle circle of friends. The simplicity and tranquillity of his life\naroused the whole of his powers to action, and surrounded with\neverything he valued in life he was supremely happy.\n\nThe country around Barbizon appealed to him irresistibly. The\ntimber-studded plains, the gently undulating, highly cultivated\nfields, presented a strange contrast to the wild and rugged country\namidst which he had spent his childhood, and no doubt conduced to the\ndevelopment of a more refined and contemplative style than he would\notherwise have acquired. Upon his few visits to his native country he\nappears to have been more impressed than ever with its austerity, and\nthe drawings which these journeys called forth bore ample evidence of\nthis feeling in him.\n\nLack of the necessary funds to carry on even his simple m\u00e9nage was\never the bane of Millet's life. On many occasions Sensier, his\nintimate friend and afterwards his biographer, informs us he dissuaded\nhim from suicide.\n\nThe sums that he owed, small though they were, rendered him in\nconstant fear of the brokers. With creditors so importunate in their\ndemands for satisfaction, and with the constant lack of recognition,\nwhich was his lot, it is astonishing that Millet achieved so much. He\nwas relieved more than once by the kind-hearted and ever faithful\nRousseau, who when his friend was sorest pressed found some delicately\nhidden means to relieve him. It was he who acquired for 4000 francs\nthe wonderful \"Peasant grafting a Tree,\" when the picture failed to\nfind a purchaser; and in order that Millet should not be aware of his\ngenerosity, he made the offer in the name of an imaginary American.\n\nThis sort of goodness he repeated more than once, and it redounds\nstill more to his credit when we remember that Rousseau himself was\nnot infrequently in pecuniary difficulties.\n\nA constant succession of important works made their appearance during\nthe first ten years Millet spent at Barbizon. The first was the\nwell-known \"Sower,\" which has ever been one of the most popular of his\npictures. Then came the far finer \"Peasants going to Work,\" which for\nmany years was in an English Collection. The \"Gleaners,\" perhaps the\nnoblest canvas the master ever painted, dates from 1857, in which year\nit was seen at the Salon; the celebrated \"Angelus\" followed it two\nyears later. The prices which Millet obtained for this series of\nremarkable works was fantastically small. The \"Gleaners\" brought him a\npaltry 2000 francs, whilst he accounted himself lucky to encounter an\namateur who gave him the same sum for the small \"Woman feeding Fowls.\"\n\nThe \"Angelus,\" which was never exhibited, was sold in the year it was\npainted to a Monsieur Feydeau, an architect, for 1800 francs. It then\npassed through several hands before the late Monsieur Secr\u00e9tan\ncompeted up to 160,000 francs before he became possessed of the prize\nat the John Wilson sale.\n\nThe purchase, however, proved a sound investment, for upon the\ndispersal of his collection it was knocked down for 553,000 francs to\na Monsieur Proust, acting on behalf of the French Government. The\nlatter, however, when they gave the commission to buy the picture, had\nno idea that such a high value would be placed upon it, and\nconsequently refused to ratify the sale; a syndicate now came upon the\nscene, who took it to America. The price, however, proved greater than\neven the millionaires of the States were prepared to give, and the\ncanvas again returned to France, where it found a resting-place in the\ncollection of Monsieur Chauchard, who paid the enormous sum of 800,000\nfrancs for its possession.\n\nIn 1859 Millet sent two works to the Salon, a \"Woman grazing her Cow,\"\nand \"Death and the Woodman.\" The latter, one of the most\nphilosophical of Millet's pictures, which to-day is the principal\nattraction of the Jacobsen Museum at Copenhagen, was rejected.\n\nDisappointments of this kind came with such systematic regularity to\nthe painter that he must have become proof against them. He always had\nbitter enemies amongst the critics, who never failed to pour abuse\nupon his method and his subjects. Even a number of his fellow artists\njoined in the chorus of disapproval. But the vehemence with which he\nwas attacked was striking evidence of the impression he was making and\nthe inward sense of his own powers; and the fact that he was working\nout his destiny according to the dictates of his own genius supported\nhim against this outpouring of prejudice and malice. The social side\nof life appealed to him more strongly as the years rolled on, and the\nmurmurings which had been heard in 1859 as to the socialistic\ntendencies of \"Death and the Woodman\" swelled to a roar when the\nstupendous \"Man with the Hoe\" was exhibited fourteen years later. The\nlatter, one of the most virile studies of depraved humanity which the\nworld has ever seen, has always been a favourite with social\nreformers, and has inspired one remarkable poem. Even his most\nimplacable critics were disarmed before this canvas; its power was\nmagnetic; it was an inspiration, soul moving and trenchant.\n\nHis financial difficulties never completely dispersed. At one time, in\norder to insure himself a little tranquillity, he made a contract with\ntwo speculators, whereby they were to become possessors of all the\nwork he produced for three years, in consideration of their assuring\nhim a thousand francs a month. A great number of Millet's finest\nproductions passed thus through their hands, including the \"Return\nfrom the Fields\" and the \"Man with the Hoe.\" The partners were not\nlong in quarrelling, and after a lawsuit had been fought, Millet was\nleft in the hands of a man who frequently would not or could not pay\nhim in ready money, and whose bills he was frequently forced to\ndiscount at considerable loss.\n\nOne little gleam of sunshine rendered his later days happy. This was a\ncommission from a Colmar banker, Monsieur Thomas by name, who required\nfour allegorical compositions representing the Seasons, to decorate\nhis rooms. The artist was overjoyed by this piece of good fortune,\nand immediately commenced a most conscientious study of such mural\ndecoration as was within reach, in order that he might do full justice\nto his patron. He paid frequent visits to Fontainebleau and the\nLouvre, and even desired a friend to inquire if he could not obtain\nreproductions of the frescoes at Herculaneum and Pompeii. In spite of\nall this elaborate preparation, the subjects were not such as appealed\nto his genius, and in spite of them being well and soundly painted, we\nare told that they presented no features which called for special\ncomment.\n\nHe found, however, a much more genial occupation in accomplishing a\nseries of drawings ordered by a Monsieur Gavet, who paid the artist\n1000, 700, and 450 francs each, according to their size. He made\naltogether ninety-five drawings in this way, and it is said that this\ngentleman had in his possession the finest work in black and white and\nwater-colour the artist ever executed.\n\nTowards the latter end of his life the death of dear relatives and\nfriends cast a sorrowful gloom over him. Amongst the latter Rousseau,\nwho expired in his presence on the 22nd of December 1867, was\nperhaps the loss which seemed to him hardest to bear. A staunch and\ntrusty friend, who was to be relied upon when his prospects seemed the\nmost hopeless, he had been one of the very few who had appreciated\nMillet's talents at their full worth, and who, moreover, scanty as his\nown means were, was ever ready to stretch out his hand to assist his\nstruggling friend.\n\nShortly afterwards Millet paid a visit to his patron, Herr Hartmann,\nat M\u00fcnster, and from here he went for a short time into Switzerland.\n\nUpon his return he devoted himself with great earnestness to work, and\nachieved a certain success at the Salons with his exhibits. The\noutbreak of the war with Germany caused him to migrate with his family\nto Cherbourg, where he thought he might continue to work, removed as\nfar as possible from the scenes of carnage and struggle which were\ngoing on farther east. Transported once more amongst the scenes of his\nchildhood, he felt an increased impetus to production, and when he\nreturned to Barbizon late in 1871, he brought with him a number of\ncanvases of the highest quality; conspicuous amongst them was the\nwonderful \"Gr\u00e9ville Church,\" now in the Louvre.\n\nThe anxieties of his troublous life were, however, beginning to show\ntheir effect upon his constitution; a persistent cough developed, and\nalthough an amelioration would occasionally occur, it was always\nsucceeded by a worse condition than before. His health suffered a\ngeneral decline, and he finally breathed his last on the 20th of\nJanuary 1875. He was buried in the little cemetery of Chailly, beside\nhis friend Rousseau, amidst the scenery they both loved so well.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE MAN AND HIS ART\n\n\nMillet is an instance of an artist working out his own destiny,\nimpelled by irresistible genius, in the teeth of seemingly\ninsurmountable obstacles. He started life with enormous disadvantages;\nwithout friends in influential circles to spread his fame or plead his\ncause; without money to enable him to outlive and triumph over the\nignorant fanaticism of critics and artists, so soaked in the\nconventionalised art of their time that they had not perception enough\nto appreciate the full meaning of that naturalistic movement, which\nwas finally to sweep away the quasi-classic art they boasted of with\nsuch bombastic effusion. The path was hard and thorny, and his triumph\nwas not finally consummated until after his death. He himself found\nhis only satisfaction in the fact that he had lived his life according\nto the dictates of his genius, and had achieved the maximum of which\nhe was capable.\n\nMillet and our own Cotman were somewhat kindred spirits; there is much\nmore affinity between the work of the two men than is apparent to any\none who has not closely studied them. The marvellous \"Breaking the\nClod,\" now happily permanently housed at the British Museum, betrays\nthe same tremendous conception and broad outlook which characterises\nmany a drawing of Millet's. Both highly strung to a painful extent,\nthey were each conscious of their inability to curb the power which\nprescribed a certain course for them, and in spite of pecuniary\ndifficulties and unpopularity, an inevitable result of their intense\noriginality, they pursued a steady course to the end of their lives.\n\nThe socialistic doctrines which have been read into the work of Millet\nare rather the outcome of the world's uneasy conscience being brought\nface to face with a crushing indictment of existing conditions, than\nof any design on the artist's part to further the cause of a political\npropaganda by means of his art. This somewhat extravagant reading into\nhis art has certainly been carried to excess. Particularly has such\nbeen the case in America, where a large number of his finest works are\nat present to be found, curiously enough in the hands of enormously\nwealthy people, who are frequently perhaps the least able to\nunderstand the real meaning of his message.\n\nComing from a peasant stock, his sympathies were always with the\npeasant; it was the only class he understood or cared for. He lived as\none of them, and shared to a large extent in their labour. He has been\ndesignated, not inappropriately, the philosopher in sabots. Rightly or\nwrongly he has come to be looked upon as one of the high priests of\ncommunistic doctrines. Few pictures have been so anathematised as the\n\"Man with the Hoe,\" and perhaps none have done more to inculcate\nsympathy with the degradation of the lower orders of the human race.\n\nThe revolting brutality and vacancy of that face haunts the\nimagination. Is it possible that fellow-creatures so utterly debased\nby toil and neglect exist? Millet dispels any doubt upon the question\nby bequeathing to humanity this trenchant portrait. By no means\nlimited to Barbizon or France, these poor creatures exist in every\ncountry, and curiously enough are considered an essential element in\neach country's development.\n\nThis poignantly human note is observable in almost every work Millet\nwrought; his passionate sympathy with his fellow-man is the keynote of\nhis art. The wood-cutter in his arduous toil, the shepherd in his\nsolitariness, the labourer turning the soil with unvarying and\nlaborious monotony, the mother caring for her children--all carry the\nsame message for him of that strange and incomprehensible mingling of\njoy and sadness we call life. Like many great minds before and since\nhis time, our artist found the greatest joy in life in a placid and\nnever changing melancholy. But the peasants he chose knew nothing of\nthe sadness he saw in them. Completely inured to their toil, and\nsubdued by it, with no refining or uplifting influence to stimulate\nthem, they knew nothing, aspired to nothing beyond what they were; it\nwas left to Millet to supply the \"might have been.\" He saw the inky\nblackness of the mind of the \"Man with the Hoe,\" the pathetic\ninequality between the mounted farmer directing the safe storage of\nhis crop, and the stooping figures of the \"Gleaners\" eager to scrape\nup the miserable crumbs which had fallen from the rich man's table. He\ntraced the lives of these simple folk until we arrive at the grim and\ngaunt figure of Death, who, as he grasps the woodman by the shoulder,\nreminds him that his course is finished and that he, in common with\nall his fellow-men, must enter the great unknown land from which there\nis no return. It is a sad and melancholy art, vibrating with purity\nand truth, the outpouring of a great soul yearning to express itself\nto the utmost of its power. The mind and character of the man can be\nread in every line and in every touch of the brush. His drawings and\netchings are even more searching in their virility than his pictures.\n\nThere is a spontaneousness about them we search for in vain in his\nwork in oil and pastel. In black and white his intensely emotional\nmind found a swift method of expression; in the laboriousness of oil\npainting he was fettered with the complications of the medium. It can\nbe fairly said that only in one or two paintings--a notable example\ncan be cited in the wondrous \"Sawyers\" at South Kensington--does he\nrise to the height of a great painter. Millet was a poet, a\nphilosopher, a great thinker, and the means he chose for expressing\nhimself were those which were best fitted to his purpose. His\npredilections in art were concentrated upon the greatest, and\nconsequently the men who appealed to him were the thinkers of the\nages. Mantegna and Correggio, Michel Angelo and the mighty Greeks,\nthese were the masters who left their impress upon his mind and art.\n\nThe influence of so sincere and profound an artist has necessarily\nbeen profound. He has moulded men who have achieved world-wide fame;\nSegantini, for example, would never have risen to the heights he did\nhad the example of Millet not been ever before him. There have been\nmany who, without possessing his genius, have endeavoured to follow\nin his footsteps, but successfully as his imitators have sometimes\ncaught his style, their productions can never live alongside his,\nbecause they lack the real ring of sincerity.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n        a. One bed, or folding cot,\n        b. One oil stove,\n        c. One lamp,\n        d. Enough supplies of all kinds sufficient for six months,\n        e. Pots, pans, kettles, etc.\nIt is needless to say that positions in Manila and Iloilo were now at\na premium.\n\nWas it possible that teachers were to be sent to places where even the\nnecessaries of life could not be obtained! Was it possible that many\nwould be sent to places so remote that for six months no fresh\nsupplies could be gotten! A mass meeting was held at once, and a\ncommittee was appointed to send a cablegram to the Associated Press\npetitioning aid from the American people at large. Realizing what\nconsternation would be created throughout the United States by such a\nmessage, two of the teachers leaped into a carriage at the close of\nthe meeting and a few moments later were closeted with the chief\nexecutive of the department. As a result the committee was persuaded\nnot to send the cablegram to the Associated Press until by courtesy it\nhad been sent to the President. Of course, this diplomatic move tided\naffairs over and the teachers who had flatly refused to budge from\nManila now agreed to go on to their stations, being assured that\nwhatever action was best would be taken.\n\nThe day had come when we must separate. We were to enter an untried\nand an unknown field. It was fitting that we have a final joyous\nmeeting, so the best orchestra in the archipelago was engaged and we\n\"chased the hours with flying feet\" until dawn so that whatever might\ncome to us in that unknown future upon which we were entering each\nwould hold in pleasant memory our last evening together.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER III. - A DRAMA IN ACTUAL LIFE.\n\n\nAlmost every one heeded the warning to go to his station forearmed\nwith at least necessaries of life, but, as it had never fallen to the\nlot of the writer to cook, he refused to learn at that late day, so he\ntook no pot, no pan, no kettle, putting his future into the hands of\nan uncertain fate and relying upon the unknown hospitality of the\nFilipino.\n\nBacalod, the capital of the province of Occidental Negros, was our\ndestination. The second morning after leaving Manila, we awoke with\nthe \"Kilpatrick\" lying at anchor in a shallow bay. We were several\nmiles from the shore and nothing in sight indicated that we had\nreached a place of any importance. Late the night before we had been\nawakened by the loud, sharp ringing of the ship's bells, accompanied\nby the reversal of the engines and a general disturbance awaking the\ncrew. So our first impressions on coming on deck were that we had run\naground. But the captain assured us that everything was ship-shape and\nthat this was the nearest point of approach to Capiz, a town of\nconsiderable importance on the island of Panay, where a body of troops\nwas to embark for home. Not even the grass hut of a native was in\nsight. Search as we would, not a sign was seen of a stream flowing\ninto the sea, indicating the probable presence of a town. There was\nnot a sign of life of any kind save one lone column of thin, blue\nsmoke that arose from the side of a mountain miles away. One would\nhave thought that we were explorers of three hundred years ago lying\noff the shore of some unknown land.\n\nAfter breakfast the steam launch, together with all the boats, was\nlowered, and several of us who had determined to miss no opportunity\nto gather information about the islands took our places in the launch\nby the side of the ship's mate, and steamed away across the water with\na long line of boats strung out in the rear. We headed away toward a\ngroup of cocoanut trees, and about an hour later stepped ashore on a\npile of decayed coral rocks that extended some twenty or thirty feet\nout into the water, thus forming the only landing place of a town of\nseveral thousands of people and of considerable commercial importance.\n\nA few moments after we had landed, an army wagon drawn by a\nmagnificent pair of mules came up out of a tropical jungle along a\nnarrow road. We clambered into the wagon and were soon lost in the\ndepths of foliage from which we had just seen the vehicle emerge.\n\nLong waving bamboos with their plumy leafage hung over the road from\neach side, meeting and overlapping in the center until they formed an\narchway so dense that the tropical sun now high in the heavens\npenetrated it only at intervals. At times the wagon sank up to the\nhubs in the soft earth, and the muscles of the mules stood out like\nwhip-cords under the skin as they drew us forward.\n\nAt a sharp turn in the road we came upon the first division of troops\nthat was to embark for home. The look of joy upon their sun-browned\nfaces was inexpressible. Their work was done, and with elastic step\nand smiling faces they saluted us as they passed by. The reign of\nforce was at an end; it was going out with them; the reign of peace\nhad begun; it was coming in with us.\n\nIn the afternoon when we returned from the town the last of the troops\nhad arrived and, as we drove up, the bugle was sounding the call to\nsupper. We noticed native women mingling with the troops and, indeed,\na native woman was in constant attention waiting upon one of the\nsoldiers with whom we ate. Her clothes were clean, her hair was nicely\ncombed, and her general appearance was neat. She seemed to anticipate\nthe slightest wish of the soldier with whom she was. She brought him\nwater to drink, cleaned his plate after the meal and saw that his\nknife, fork, and spoon were put into his haversack.\n\nWe had now finished supper and the launch had returned for the last\nload of troops. The lieutenant in command of the company gave the\norder to \"fall in\"; the men shouldered their rifles and fell into\nline. \"Forward, march!\" called the lieutenant, and the column swept\nforward towards the boats. The women had until now restrained\nthemselves, but, as their husbands marched away never to return, their\nfeelings could no longer be restrained. One young woman of about\neighteen, who was leaning against a rock by the roadside sobbing, when\nher husband passed, leaped up in frenzy of passionate love and caught\nthe rifle from his shoulder. Her first impulse seemed to be to throw\nthe gun away, but suddenly realizing the futility of such an act she\nburst into tears, shouldered the rifle herself and marched on by his\nside. Another woman of more mature age threw her arms around the legs\nof a tall stalwart man, and drew him bodily from the line.\n\nBut the troops marched on and entered the boats. One woman who had\nbeen unnoticed before came down into the shallow water and caught hold\nof our last boat as if to prevent its leaving, while others stood\nmingling their sobs with the sounds of the wavelets as they broke on\nthe sands. As we passed away, an expectant mother, standing in bold\noutline against the twilight sky, threw up her hands in an agony of\ndespair and then sank upon the stones. The curtain had fallen upon a\ndrama in actual life deeper in pathos than any other we had ever seen\nor ever expected to see. Depth of passion, depth of love! Who can\nfathom the human heart?\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. - WHAT THE TEACHERS DID.\n\n\nThere is a remarkable sameness about the towns in the Philippines.\n\nThey all have a large open square about the middle of the town, around\nthree sides of which are Chinese stores, unless one side lies open to\nthe sea, and on the fourth is the great stone ecclesia. The streets\nrun at right angles to one another and divide up the town into\ncreditable squares.\n\nEverybody in the Philippines lives up-stairs, for the ground is so\nsoaked with water during the rainy season that it is a menace to\nhealth to live upon the ground floor. So even the poorest nippa hut\nis built upon stakes four or five feet above the ground.\n\nBacalod is a typical Philippine town. As we landed, a broad open\nsquare was spread out before us. Two sides of the square were lined\nwith two-story houses in which were Chinese stores below and Filipino\nhomes above. On the third side stood the great stone church in whose\nmassive tower the clock was striking the hour of four, while the\nfourth lay open to the sea that had borne us thither.\n\nWe landed, but it was in a method new to us and one not usually\nemployed by the traveling public.\n\nWhen our sail boat ran aground on the sandy bottom a hundred yards or\nmore from the shore, a crowd of Filipino men who were on the beach\nslowly rolled up their pantaloons and waded out to the rescue,--for\nthe money that was in it. The boat's crew elevated their trousers'\nlegs also and slided down into the water. Each of us then straddled\nthe neck of a Filipino standing in the water and was held by ankles to\nbe steadied while our biped mounts proceeded to the shore.\n\nWe were now on the ground and face to face with the situation. To give\nthe reader an idea of the actual conditions met by the first teachers\nwho went to the Islands, the following is copied from the instructions\ngiven us in Manila:\n    1. There shall be two sessions daily of all schools, and the\n    last hour of the morning session shall be devoted solely to\n    instructing the Filipino teachers.\n\n    2. In cases where teachers are sent to a town in which there\n    is no school-house, they are expected to secure the aid of the\n    people and have one built.\n\n    3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is\n    stopped.\n\n    4. All supplies must be kept under lock and key. In towns\n    where there is no case or box to lock the supplies in, and it\n    is also impossible to get the town council to furnish a case,\n    a requisition may be sent to Manila, and, if an appropriation\n    can be secured, one will be made and sent out.\n\nThus it can be easily seen that we were indeed pioneers. In many\nplaces no school-house was to be found, and in some cases it was even\ndifficult to get the town council to provide a case in which to keep\nthe supplies.\n\nThe work of the teachers was, in short; to \"make the English language\nthe basis of instruction in the public schools.\" On our arrival at\nBacalod two schools were found in progress, for some soldiers had been\ndetailed for the work here previous to our coming. One of these was\nfor boys and the other, for girls. Thus the work here had been in a\nmeasure simplified, but complications that had arisen at Talisay, one\nof the largest and richest towns on the island, demanded a change of\nteachers and the writer was assigned to the place as superintendent.\n\nHere an attempt had been made to start a school but it had failed\nignominiously and a system of education was to be put into operation\nfrom the very start.\n\nThe Filipinos are not strong advocates of co-education, so separate\nschools were to be started for the boys and the girls. The one for the\nboys was gotten well in hand before the one for the girls was\nattempted at all.\n\nA few days after reaching the town and securing a home the\npresidente of the town had it publicly announced that the following\nMonday morning at eight o'clock a public school for boys would be\nopened in a building that had been rented for the purpose by the\nmunicipal council. About the middle of the afternoon of the same day a\nman beat a little drum throughout all the streets of the town to call\nthe people out and the town clerk announced both in Spanish and in the\nnative language that this public school would begin at the time and\nplace mentioned above; that instruction would be free to all who came;\nthat the government would furnish all supplies; and that instruction\nwould be given in the English language. A native principal and\nassistants were employed and everything was ready to begin.\n\nThe official report of the result is as follows:\n    Boys' public school of Talisay, Negros, P. I., began November\n    4, 1901. Forty-three boys present at eight o'clock. Forty-one\n    of them knew \"good morning\" and \"good afternoon\" but do not\n    know the distinction between them. Two of them speak simple\n    Spanish. At eight forty-five, eight more, who had been\n    attending an early morning private school, came in together.\n\n    The books they brought were so varied and so different from\n    one another that it seemed impossible to bring any reasonable\n    degree of order out of such a chaos, and so, after struggling\n    vainly for about a week with the problem, the superintendent\n    by one fell stroke removed everything in use and put in a\n    uniform system, and from that day on the English language has\n    been the basis of instruction in the public schools of\n    Talisay. The work was of necessity very slow at first, but by\n    the end of a year two schools were going nicely and a number\n    of the brightest boys and girls had made really excellent\n    progress.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER V. - A \"BAILE.\"\n\n\nNot long after the arrival of our party at Bacalod we received an\ninvitation to a \"baile\" given in our honor by the inhabitants of\nSilay, a town some ten or twelve miles up the northern coast and one\nnoted for its social life. The invitation was accepted with pleasure,\nand about the middle of the afternoon on the day appointed we were\nclad in the immaculate white of the tropics and steaming away up the\ncoast on board a launch sent for our conveyance. Twilight was still\nlingering on the path of day when we anchored just off shore at the\ntown. A row-boat containing the officials of the city came out to meet\nus and, in due season, we were ushered into a spacious drawing-room\nfilled almost to overflowing with the \u00e9lite of the town. The \u00e9lite of\ntowns in the Philippines speak Spanish, and, as only one or two of our\nparty could at that time boast of more than a formal acquaintance with\nthe Castilian tongue, the exchange of ideas that evening between us\nand the Filipinos was of necessity not very rapid.\n\nThe necessity of easy communication between us was rendered somewhat\nless indispensable by the announcement of supper as soon as we were\nrested from our trip. When we had taken our places at the table a\nyoung Filipino about twenty-five years of age arose and gave a lengthy\ntoast to the recent union of the Philippines with the United States.\n\nBut as we Americans were unable to scale the dizzy heights of his\nclimaxes or sink to the depths of his pathos, we forewent the\npleasures of his oratory and turned our attention to the savory odor\nof lamb, chicken, and roast pig that came slyly stealing up our\nnostrils to send us nerve dispatches about the gastronomic delights of\nour not far distant future.\n\nAt last the toast was ended and the world-wide soup ushered in a long\ntrain of things good to eat, served in a style better fitted to the\ndelights of the appetite than to the formalities of dinners, for, as\nsoon as the pleasant task of one dish was completed by any one, the\nnext was served him at once regardless of the progress made by the\nothers at the table.\n\nThe last course was dulce. The new-comers to the Philippines will\nnot be long in making the acquaintance of this dish, and at all\nmeetings, both public and private, where eatables are served, it\nperforms an important part. It is anything sweet, and it may vary all\nthe way from an india-rubber-like black mixture of cocoanut milk and\ndirty sugar to a really toothsome and respectable confection. No\nmatter of what materials a dish is composed, just so long as it is\nsweet, it is dulce.\n\nAfter paying our respects to this last course, we arose from the table\nand entered a great rectangular room from the center of whose ceiling\nhung a large glass chandelier, a mass of shimmering crystals. In the\nchairs around the room were the wealth, the youth, and the beauty of\nthe town.\n\nThe first and also the last number of every Filipino dance of any\nformality is the \"rigodon.\" The dancers are arranged in a square, or\nquadrangle according to the number participating, and are then led\nthrough a tangled maze of figures that so utterly bewilders the novice\nthat he sinks into his chair at the end of the dance wondering how it\nall came to pass.\n\nWe Americans breathed a sigh of relief when the \"rigodon\" ended, and\nmustered fresh courage for social conquests in the waltz that was now\nbreathing forth from the trembling strings. My companion in the first\ndance had been the young lady by whose side I had sat at dinner. But\nit now became necessary to search for another, so I prudently waited\nto see how partners were chosen, and made no mistake when a few\nmoments later I faced one of the most luscious looking se\u00f1oritas on\nthe opposite side of the room and offered her my arm. My eyes must\nhave told the story that my lips could not utter in Spanish, for she\nsmiled upon me sweetly, arose, and put her hand upon my shoulder. My\narm encircled her waist and I began to waltz. Unfortunately my\ncompanion did not follow, but began to hop up and down in a manner\nmost distressing. Supposing the attack to be only temporary, I paused\nand, much to my relief, she soon showed signs of recovery; and in the\ncourse of time she came to a standstill looking up into my face in an\ninquiring sort of way, apparently wondering why St. Vitus had not paid\nhis respects to me also. A second attempt to follow the music met with\nresults similar to the first, and during the third attempt, which\nseemed to be trembling on the verge of a failure, St. Vitus let go my\ncompanion and seized me with such vigor that she, who was small even\nfor a Filipino, was gathered up bodily and taken around the room at\nsuch a pace that her toes touched the floor only at far distant\nintervals.\n\nAt this point my devotion to the shrine of Terpsichore ceased from\nforce of circumstances and I seated myself in one of the most\ncomfortable chairs in sight that I might carry out a previously formed\nplan to study the Filipino somewhat critically as he appears in\nsociety.\n\nThe first thing that impressed me as the dancers passed up and down\nthe room was the flash of diamonds. Nearly every woman in the room had\non a brooch that flashed the colors of the rainbow at every turn.\n\nAlmost all of them wore one or more rings that showed up brilliantly\nunder the chandelier. Many of the men too, especially the young men,\nwore gems that appeared to be exquisite. A closer inspection showed\nthat some of the gems had flaws and others were of a poor color, but\nno one would have denied that, taken as a whole, it was a really\nbeautiful display.\n\nThe dress of the ladies was richly colored. Many of their skirts were\nof silk covered with hand embroidered flowers, and their filmy pina\nwaists and broad collar pieces were rich with needle-work. They all\nwore a kind of heelless velvet slipper, very common as a dress shoe in\nthe Philippines, or high-heeled patent leather shoes with neatly\nfitting black stockings.\n\nThe men were dressed in white coats and white pantaloons or black\ncoats and white pantaloons. White shirts and collars, together with\nall sorts and styles of cravats and low-cut patent leather shoes with\nhighly colored socks completed their dress.\n\nIt was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money;\nthat they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a\ntable loaded with good things was a fact to which all of us were\nenthusiastic witnesses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VI. - A SKETCH OF LIFE IN THE PHILIPPINES.\n\n\nHouse-keeping in the Philippines presents some interesting phases. Our\nclub of American officials decided to run a mess, so we employed a\ncook and a house boy, then each of us provided himself with a personal\nservant, making a total of six servants for four men--it takes about\nthis proportion of servants to live in any sort of comfort in the\nPhilippines--and launched ourselves boldly upon the sea of domestic\neconomy. But there were shoals ahead of us, for the question of\nregulating servants is one of no small importance in the Philippines,\nand one of its most disadvantageous features is the long chain of\ndependents that usually attends it.\n\nWe gave the cooks so much a day with which to buy supplies in the\nlocal market, for our own table, making him render a daily list of\nexpenditures, and a fixed amount besides to purchase rice and fish for\nhimself and the other servants. Of course, if they wished to vary\ntheir diet and get chicken and fresh pork, which could be had at far\ndistant intervals, it was wholly a matter of their option, but the\nallowance was made on the basis of so much rice and fish a day for\neach. This allowance was about fifteen cents a day in Spanish coin per\nservant.\n\nThus far all was well. We had agreed to give the cook eight dollars a\nmonth in Spanish money, thinking that good wages would procure good\nservice, but the visions of affluence that floated before him on such\nfloods of wealth were so alluring that they drew him from the kitchen\nto the cooler veranda. In less than a week he had employed an\nassistant at four dollars a month; in less than another week that\nassistant had employed him an assistant at two dollars a month; in\nless than another week that assistant to the assistant had employed\nhim an assistant at the princely salary of fifty cents a month; and\nfrom fear that the chain of dependents would end only by our having\nthe whole Filipino race attached to our culinary force, we broke up\nhouse-keeping and went boarding again, choosing that as the less of\nthe two evils.\n\nOur house furnishings were almost wholly Philippine. The table ware\nand the food on the table came from the ends of the earth. The knives\nand forks were made in Germany, the plates were manufactured in\nEngland, the glass ware and table cloth, in the United States. The\noatmeal and flour came from the United States also. The butter came\nfrom Australia, the rice from China, the salt from Russia, and the\nother eatables from sources about as various as their separate names.\n\nSwitzerland furnished the condensed milk and Illinois the canned\ncream. Nearly all of the canned fruit bore labels from Spain.\n\nThus it can easily be seen that life in the Philippines, if lived\naccording to American ideals, is dependent upon a highly developed and\nhighly complex commerce. However, the difficulties of transportation\nand the restriction of large stocks of merchandise to Manila and some\nhalf a dozen other towns, make so great a difference between country\nlife and city life that a short comparison of the two will not be out\nof place, and life in Manila may well be taken as being fairly typical\nof the latter.\n\nLife in Manila is pleasant, but expensive. It is pleasant from the\nfact that it is not only the capital but also metropolis of the\narchipelago. Thus the combination of wealth and high official position\nhas given to Manila a society of the highest and most refined type.\n\nThe process of beautifying and improving the city which is constantly\ngoing on bids fair to give us at no distant day a city of which we may\nwell be proud.\n\nBut let him who intends living well in Manila on a small income bid\nfarewell at once to so idylic a dream, for it costs much to live well\nthere. In the city of Manila one can get almost anything he wishes,\nbut it must be paid for at the price it commands. Especially in the\ncase of eatables, this price is by no means small, because to the\nfirst cost of articles must in most cases be added the expense of\ndistant shipment from American, European, or Australian ports, and not\ninfrequently the cost of long refrigeration must also be taken into\nconsideration. But, expensive though it is, it is very pleasant to\nlive there and those who have once enjoyed it often wish again to\nquaff the cup of its delights.\n\nIn strong contrast to this pleasant life is the life of the quiet\nlittle hamlet away in the distant islands. Indeed, the Filipino from\nthe distant town, who by some good fortune has been to Manila, or, by\na coup de main, has studied in one of the Manila colleges, is looked\nup to in a true hero-worshiping attitude by all who either know him or\nhear of his fame. Life in such a place is one long state of harmless\ninactivity. Not a wave of trouble from the great outer world ever\ndisturbs its peaceful repose. One lounges forever in an air of\nindolent ease and extreme aversion to anything approaching what might\nbe called a respectable effort.\n\nOne arises in the morning about the time the sun's first rays silver\nthe top leaves of the cocoanut trees and then stirs around until nine\nor ten o'clock, when it is found expedient to avoid a further exposure\nto the sun. From then until about five o'clock in the afternoon it is\nbest to take things as they come, even though one of those things be a\nFilipino dinner. But then you may have your vehiclo attached to a\nyoung bull with a ring in his nose and go for a drive. If it is the\ndry season you will probably enjoy the drive unless you object to the\nfrequent clouds of dust swept along by the evening wind. If it is in\nthe rainy season your pleasure will depend to a considerable extent\nupon how wet you get; but, whether the season be wet or dry, your\npleasure will be regulated largely by the state of harmony existing\nbetween the driver and the bull.\n\nIn these quiet secluded nooks successive generations of Filipinos are\nborn, reared, grow old and die in an even chain of events broken only\nby the occasional erection of a new grass house on the identical spot\nwhere its predecessors have stood for ages. The son lives in the house\nof his father, cultivates the same few square feet of soil planted in\nedible roots, climbs the same cocoanut trees, follows the same winding\npath down to the stream, pounds rice in the same mortar and with the\nsame stick that his ancestors have used from time unremembered, and,\nin case of illness, curls up on a grass mat in a corner of the room\nuntil he dies or by some good fortune recovers. Beyond this narrow\nhorizon he never looks. So narrow and contracted is the life that the\nlanguages of two towns a few miles apart are so different that one\nwould scarcely recognize them as belonging to the same race of people.\n\nSuch are the two extremes of life in our new far Eastern provinces:\nthe one is active, progressive, and cosmopolitan; the other, inactive,\ndecadent, and narrow; but, whether one enjoys the first or endures the\nsecond, there comes to him after leaving a longing to lounge again in\ntropic airs and listen to the lullaby of the winds among the palms.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VII. - THE FILIPINO AT HOME.\n\n\nAs one enters a Filipino sitting-room for the first time, there is one\nfeature in the arrangement of the furniture that impresses itself upon\nhim at once, and it may be stated without fear of serious\ncontradiction that this same peculiar feature in its arrangement will\ncontinue to face him, as he enters different homes, about as certainly\nas he crosses the threshold.\n\nThe arrangement referred to is that of one large mirror, one settee,\nand some ten or a dozen chairs that appear to have had a certain\norderly affection for one another. The mirror is hung upon one of the\nlarge interior parts of the house about four feet above the floor. The\nwooden houses in the Philippines are built by setting large posts\nupright into the ground, extending into the air from twenty to thirty\nfeet. Cross timbers are fastened to these upright posts about eight or\nten feet above the ground and then not sawed off even with the posts,\nbut allowed to extend beyond them each way. The framework of the house\nis built upon these extending cross timbers, a style of building by\nwhich these large upright posts are left standing out on the inside of\nthe room from one to three feet from the walls. It is on that one of\nthese posts most nearly opposite the door that the mirror always finds\nits place. Immediately beneath the mirror is the settee; and the\nchairs are arranged in two parallel lines facing one another and at\nright angles with the ends of the settee. However odd this arrangement\nmay appear to one when he first enters a Filipino drawing-room, there\nare two things to be said in its favor. In the first place, it places\nyou face to face with the person with whom you are conversing so that\nyou can watch him,--a matter of no small moment in the Philippines. In\nthe next place, it enables you to give one of the young ladies a\nsheep's-eye in the mirror while the others present are left where\nMoses was in our much abused conundrum.\n\nThe size of the residence and the quality of its furnishings depends\nupon the wealth of the owner. But there is so vast a difference\nbetween the mode of life of the highest class and the tao, or lowest\nclass, that it is well to speak of them separately, and the great\nmiddle class of Filipinos can easily be imagined to occupy the\nintervening ground.\n\nThe rich Filipino's house is usually of wood built upon a wall of\nstone or brick from ten to fifteen feet high. The floors are kept\nhighly polished in his hallway, dressing-room, and bed-rooms. There\nare, of course, no fire-places in any of the rooms, but on some\noccasions something is needed to dry the rain-soaked atmosphere, for\neven in the dry season it has been seen to rain for five successive\ndays and nights without the cessation of a moment.\n\nA long chain of dependents is attached to the household of the rich\nFilipino. The master has his special body servant to be present at all\ntimes to do his master's bidding, in short, to be the visible\nmechanism of his master's volition. So, too, the lady of the house has\nher servant woman to do the slightest bidding of her ladyship. Then\nthere is the cook who is almost invariably a man, a house boy or two,\nand the coachman. These functionaries, with their assistants and\nassistants to the assistants, together with a servant or two for the\nexclusive service of the children, complete the economic household.\n\nSuch a family has an abundance of rice and wheat bread, also of\nchicken and fish with occasional fresh beef. They have also a good\ndeal of dulce. They regularly serve wine and frequently serve beer\non their tables.\n\nIn strong contrast with this mode of life is that of the tao. His\ndiet consists almost wholly of rice and small uncleaned fish boiled\ntogether. As a rule knife, fork, plate, and spoon find no place in his\nhousehold. The rice and fish are boiled in a pot and then allowed to\ncool in the same vessel or poured out to cool in a large earthen or\nwooden bowl. Then Mr. Tao together with Mrs. Tao and all the young\nTaos squat on their heels around the mixture and satisfy that\nintangible thing called the appetite. They do not use chop sticks as\nthe Chinese do, but the rice and fish are caught in a hollow formed by\nthe first three fingers of the right hand. The thumb is then placed\nbehind the mass. It is raised up and poised before the mouth, with a\nskill coming from the evolution of ages, when a contraction of the\nmuscles of the thumb throws the mass into the mouth with a skill that\nis marvelous to any but a Filipino. To judge from the most reliable\ninformation, the poorest class do not have an abundance of food,\nalthough it would seem that such a condition of things would be\nwell-nigh impossible. However, in a census of one hundred school\nchildren there were found six boys and four girls who declared that\nthey had never had enough to eat, and the native teacher stated that\nthis was probably true.\n\nThe wide gulf between the tao and the rich man is filled by the\ngreat middle class of Filipinos.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VIII. - VISIT TO A LEPER COLONY.\n\n\nNot far from our town was a leper colony and the first Saturday that\ncould be spared was set aside for a trip to the place. It happened\nthat none of the other Americans were at leisure on this particular\nmorning, but, rather then delay the trip or miss it altogether, the\nwriter, armed with a revolver, started out alone.\n\nThe road had been described so accurately by one who was supposed to\nknow it that it was deemed well-nigh impossible to miss the way. The\nmain highway was followed to the point where the by-path supposed to\nlead to the settlement turned off through some bamboo thickets and a\nlow tropical wood. This path led straight away towards the sea-coast\nwhere the houses of the colony were said to stand in a cocoanut grove\nby the beach.\n\nUpon arriving at the settlement, a very inhospitable reception was\nreceived from a mangy cur that growled and showed a very uninviting\nset of sharp, white teeth behind his snarling lips. The growling of\nthe dog had attracted the attention of an old man who, with age-bent\nback, was pounding rice in a mortar about fifty yards away. He turned\nslowly around and, upon seeing an intruder into the primitive quiet of\nthe place, gave a sharp, far-reaching call. The sound had scarcely\nrung through the grove when from about a dozen of the little grass\nhouses dotted here and there fifteen or twenty men armed with bolos\ncame out and gathered around the old man. A sense of my danger flashed\nupon me. Three miles from town and alone in a tropical jungle, I could\nbe almost instantly overcome by this band of bolo-men, and the only\nreport that would ever reach my people would be that I had\n\"disappeared.\" Of course, attack was by no means certain, but the\npotentiality of the situation was thrilling. A drawn revolver and the\ngleaming of its shining barrel had the effect of stopping the men, who\nseemed to be hesitating as to a course of action, until a somewhat\ndignified retreat was made to an open space in the rear from where a\nless dignified and a more hasty retreat began which did not stop short\nof Bacalod.\n\nEnough had been seen, however, even in this short visit, to give\nconvincing proof that the settlement visited was no colony of lepers;\nso, that afternoon two servant boys being taken as guides and\ninterpreters, another attempt was made to reach the goal desired.\n\nThis attempt was successful, and, after about two hours of walking, a\nlittle cluster of grass huts snugly hidden by the sea-coast came into\nview. As we approached, one would have thought it a gala-day. Some few\nchildren, apparently from six to thirteen years of age, almost wholly\nnude, were romping and playing in the open space around which the huts\nstood, and no one would ever have thought that any cloud so horrible\nas leprosy could hover over a place apparently so happy.\n\nBy the side of the path as we passed was a man and his wife setting\nout potato plants. His hands were so puffed and his fingers so short\nthat he could scarcely use them, but he was working along as best he\ncould. His wife's feet were so swollen and twisted that she walked\nonly with the greatest difficulty. We passed them by and entered the\nopen space above referred to.\n\nThe children now saw us, and those of them who could darted away like\nfrightened rabbits, each to his own burrow. An old man who was sitting\nin the warm afternoon sun on the little bamboo platform before his hut\nwas aroused from his lethargic repose by the scampering away of the\nchildren. He arose, trembling upon his tottering limbs, all drawn and\ntwisted, and hobbled away into his hut.\n\nThe children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at\nthe doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of\nthe settlement. In a few moments we were surrounded by a circle of\nhuman beings at once so repulsive and so pitiable that its graphic\nvividness can never be accurately portrayed.\n\nThe old man referred to above, having put on a pair of snow-white\npantaloons, appeared now at the doorway of his hut, followed a few\nmoments later by his wife who had evidently clothed herself in the\nbest raiment she had. At a call from the old man, all the men, women,\nand children in the settlement came out of their huts and stood in a\nline before us. The old man was spokesman and in his native visayan\ntongue made a heart-rending appeal for aid which we were powerless to\ngive. Attention was called to a leper woman, apparently about\ntwenty-five years of age, whose face had been attacked by the disease\nand whose appearance was truly pathetic. Upon her hip was a child\nabout a year and a half old and, strange to say, the child showed as\nyet no signs whatever of the disease.\n\nWhat an indissoluble enigma is life! Here in a little cluster of grass\nhuts in a secluded nook of a secluded island of an all but secluded\narchipelago was gathered together a little community of wretched\nnatives, driven by their loathsomeness from association with others\neven of the same half-savage race. Yet here, men and women loved and\nwere married, by mutual trust if not by law, and children were born of\nthe union to live forever under the unspeakable horror that\novershadowed the unfortunate parents. Love, hatred, sorrow, and\njoy--every passion that enters into the complex structure of the human\nheart even here, in this scene of sadness and despair, was playing\napparently as freely as where misfortune and disease had never crossed\nthe portals of life.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER IX. - A \"HIKE.\"\n\n\nWe were lounging lazily in our hammocks at Jimamaylan one evening in\nApril. Supper was just ended, and the soldiers in the post were\ncollected in groups here and there spinning yarns to pass away the\ntime, when a Filipino clad only in a loin cloth came down the street\nat a steadily swinging run and stopped in front of the sentry. He\nbrought the announcement that a band of ladrones had just burned a\nsugar mill and were advancing to sack a barrio about fifteen miles\naway.\n\nThe invitation of the commanding officer to go on a \"hike\" was eagerly\naccepted, and, in ten minutes after the message was given, the troops\nwere on the march followed by two adventurous pedagogues.\n\nDarkness was just closing in as we left the town, but a resplendent\ntropic moon soon made the night almost as brilliant as the day. The\ntrail we followed led over rough and rocky country. Sometimes for a\ndistance of a mile or more we passed over barren wastes of volcanic\nslag poured out in anger by some peak whose convulsions have long\nsince ceased. Again we would descend into a tropical jungle from the\ndense foliage of which the ladrones could have leaped at any moment,\nhad they known of our coming, and annihilated our little band. We\nforded rapid streams with the water at our breasts, and halted only\nonce in that rapid march of fifteen miles.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the town we met a man who was standing\nguard against a surprise by the ladrones. Nothing could well have been\nmuch more grotesque and nothing could much better illustrate the\nabsolutely primitive condition of the Filipinos in the interior of the\nislands than the appearance of this guard. A pair of knee pants, a\nconical grass hat, and a hemp shirt formed his entire apparel. A long\nflat wooden shield, a bolo, and a long bamboo spear with a sharp,\nflat, iron point, completed his equipment for battle.\n\nHere stood the first and the twentieth centuries side by side. The\nFilipino who had advanced only a stage beyond the condition of\nprimitive man with his knife, spear, and wooden shield, stood side by\nside with the American soldier, a representative of modern life with\nhis magazine rifle, his canteen, his knapsack,--with every article of\nhis clothing made to give him the highest possible efficiency as the\nunit of a military organization.\n\nA few yards farther on we met another guard equipped similarly to the\nfirst. Upon reaching the town, news had just been received that a\ndetachment of troops from another post had intercepted the ladrones\nand fought a skirmish with them. The ladrones had escaped and we set\nout in pursuit of them on a chase wilder than a Quixotic dream. We\nwound our way into the mountains behind the town, inquiring at every\ngrass hut we passed whether the band of ladrones had passed that way,\nbut only once was even a trace of them found. Then it was learned that\nat a certain place they had separated into groups of three or four and\ngone glimmering through the dream of things that were. This place was\nin a secluded nook of the mountains where in years gone by some\nadventurous Spaniard had erected a primitive water mill to grind his\nsugar-cane. We had now marched about twenty miles and the feet of the\npedagogues were a mass of blisters. They had reached the point where\nthat form of military maneuvering called \"hiking\" ceased to possess\nany alluring charms. So a native was persuaded to come out of his lone\nmountain hut and hitch up his carabao and cart. He was then made to\nget on the carabao's back, while the aforesaid pedagogues lay down on\nthe sugar-cane pulp that had been put into the body of the cart, and\nthe driver was instructed to start for the post we had left hours\nbefore, and not to stop until he got there. Being uncertain but that\nsome of the ladrones would learn of our having left the body of troops\nand would try the metal of our steel, we at first agreed that neither\nof us should go to sleep, but it was later decided that probably the\ndriver had no greater desire to cross the Styx than his passengers had\nand that in case of danger he would awaken us, so both took a revolver\nin each hand, stretched out supinely and went to sleep.\n\nSuch a sleep! The rough jolting of the cart over an almost impassable\nroad was never enough to break the spell of slumber. When we awoke the\nblazing tropic sun was past the midday mark of morning, shining full\ninto our unprotected and well-nigh blistered faces.\n\nA pack of dogs were heralding our approach to a little village at the\nfoot of the mountains where ponies were procured to take us back to\nthe post."

                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently\nno time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth dimension of Space\nas a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house\nbecame quite quiet.\n\nOn reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up\nagainst a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realize\nhis position. Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\nhundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the\nDowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone\ninto hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains on\none of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who\nhad been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr\nto nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair\nby the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six\nweeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become\nreconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that\nnotorious sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible\nnight when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his\ndressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and\nconfessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox\nout of \u00a350,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card, and swore that\nthe ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back\nto him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because\nhe had seen a green hand tapping at the window-pane, to the beautiful\nLady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round\nher throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin,\nand who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of the\nKing's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he went\nover his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as\nhe recalled to mind his last appearance as \"Red Reuben, or the Strangled\nBabe,\" his d\u00e9but as \"Guant Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,\"\n\nand the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely\nplaying ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And\nafter all this some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him\nthe Rising Sun Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite\nunbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever been treated in this\nmanner. Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance, and remained till\ndaylight in an attitude of deep thought.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III\n\n\nThe next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed\nthe ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. \"I have\nno wish,\" he said, \"to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say\nthat, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,\"--a very just remark,\nat which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.\n\n\"Upon the other hand,\" he continued, \"if he really declines to use the\nRising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him. It\nwould be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside\nthe bedrooms.\"\n\nFor the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the\nblood-stain on the library floor. This certainly was very strange, as\nthe door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept\nclosely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a\ngood deal of comment. Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red,\nthen it would be vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came\ndown for family prayers, according to the simple rites of the Free\nAmerican Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright\nemerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party\nvery much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening. The\nonly person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia, who,\nfor some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the\nsight of the blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was\nemerald-green.\n\nThe second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in\nthe hall. Rushing down-stairs, they found that a large suit of old\narmour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone\nfloor, while seated in a high-backed chair was the Canterville ghost,\nrubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face. The\ntwins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged\ntwo pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained\nby long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United\nStates Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in\naccordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost\nstarted up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a\nmist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so\nleaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase\nhe recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of\ndemoniac laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely\nuseful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single\nnight, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French\ngovernesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly\nlaughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and\nrang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door\nopened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown. \"I am\nafraid you are far from well,\" she said, \"and have brought you a bottle\nof Doctor Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a\nmost excellent remedy.\" The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at\nonce to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an\naccomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family\ndoctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's\nuncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps,\nhowever, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself\nwith becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep\nchurchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.\n\nOn reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the\nmost violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross\nmaterialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what\nreally distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit\nof mail. He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by\nthe sight of a Spectre in armour, if for no more sensible reason, at\nleast out of respect for their natural poet Longfellow, over whose\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\nhour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides it was his own suit.\n\nHe had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament, and had\nbeen highly complimented on it by no less a person than the Virgin Queen\nherself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely overpowered\nby the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen\nheavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees severely, and\nbruising the knuckles of his right hand.\n\nFor some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of\nhis room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.\n\nHowever, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to\nmake a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his\nfamily. He selected Friday, August 17th, for his appearance, and spent\nmost of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in\nfavour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet\nfrilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards evening a\nviolent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was\njust such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to\nmake his way quietly to Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the\nfoot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\nof low music. He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville\nblood-stain by means of Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent. Having reduced\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and\nhis wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead,\nwhile he hissed into her trembling husband's ear the awful secrets of\nthe charnel-house. With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made\nup his mind. She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and\ngentle. A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more\nthan sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the\ncounterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins, he was quite\ndetermined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be done was, of\ncourse, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling\nsensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each\nother, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse,\ntill they became paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw off the\nwinding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white, bleached bones and\none rolling eyeball, in the character of \"Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's\nSkeleton,\" a r\u00f4le in which he had on more than one occasion produced a\ngreat effect, and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of\n\"Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.\"\n\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the\nlight-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves\nbefore they retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still,\nand, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the\nwindow-panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family\nslept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\ncould hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States. He\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his\nmurdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like\nan evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.\n\nOnce he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only\nthe baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange\nsixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\nin the midnight air. Finally he reached the corner of the passage that\nled to luckless Washington's room. For a moment he paused there, the\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's\nshroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was\ncome. He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had\nhe done so than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid\nhis blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was\nstanding a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous\nas a madman's dream! Its head was bald and burnished; its face round,\nand fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\nfeatures into an eternal grin. From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\nlight, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like\nto his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form. On its breast\nwas a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of\nshame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime,\nand, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\n\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's\njack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler. Once in the\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small\npallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes. After a time, however,\nthe brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to\ngo and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight. Accordingly,\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling\nthat, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid\nof his new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins. On reaching\nthe spot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had\nevidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from\nits hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it\nwas leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable\nattitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his\nhorror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a\nrecumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity\nbed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow\nturnip lying at his feet! Unable to understand this curious\ntransformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there,\nin the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:--\n        +------------------------------------+\n        |         YE OTIS GHOSTE             |\n        | Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook, |\n        |    Beware of Ye Imitationes.       |\n        |   All others are counterfeite.     |\n        +------------------------------------+\nThe whole thing flashed across him. He had been tricked, foiled, and\nout-witted! The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his\ntoothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his\nhead, swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\nschool, that, when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds\nof blood would be wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.\n\nHardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of\na distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh,\nand waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\nreason, did not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back\nto his room, thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose. There he\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was\nexceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which this oath\nhad been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second time. \"Perdition\nseize the naughty fowl,\" he muttered, \"I have seen the day when, with my\nstout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow\nfor me an 'twere in death!\" He then retired to a comfortable lead\ncoffin, and stayed there till evening.\n\n\nCHAPTER: IV\n\n\nThe next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were\ncompletely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five\ndays he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point\nof the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want\nit, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a\nlow, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating\nthe symbolic value of sensuous phenomena. The question of phantasmic\napparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a\ndifferent matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large\noriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every month, and he\ndid not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is\nquite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand,\nhe was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.\n\nFor the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as\nusual between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible\nprecaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots,\ntrod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large\nblack velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for\noiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good\ndeal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of\nprotection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he\nslipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a\nlittle humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see\nthat there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a\ncertain degree, it served his purpose. Still in spite of everything he\nwas not left unmolested. Strings were continually being stretched across\nthe corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion,\nwhile dressed for the part of \"Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley\nWoods,\" he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide,\nwhich the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry\nChamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged\nhim, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and\nsocial position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the\nnext night in his celebrated character of \"Reckless Rupert, or the\nHeadless Earl.\"\n\nHe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in\nfact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means\nof it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord\nCanterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome\nJack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\ndown the terrace at twilight. Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\nLord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken\nheart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it\nhad been a great success. It was, however an extremely difficult\n\"make-up,\" if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more\nscientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three\nhours to make his preparations. At last everything was ready, and he was\nvery pleased with his appearance. The big leather riding-boots that went\nwith the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\nfind one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite\nsatisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting\nand crept down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins,\nwhich I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of\nthe colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make\nan effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water\nfell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his\nleft shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed. The shock to his\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\ncould go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold. The only\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\nhad not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences\nmight have been very serious.\n\nHe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,\nand contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in\nlist slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\ndraughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the\ntwins. The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September. He\nhad gone down-stairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that\nthere, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing\nhimself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of\nthe United States Minister and his wife which had now taken the place of\nthe Canterville family pictures. He was simply but neatly clad in a long\nshroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip\nof yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In\nfact, he was dressed for the character of \"Jonas the Graveless, or the\nCorpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,\" one of his most remarkable\nimpersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to\nremember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their\nneighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a quarter-past two o'clock in\nthe morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring. As\nhe was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any\ntraces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a\ndark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads,\nand shrieked out \"BOO!\" in his ear.\n\nSeized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural,\nhe rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him\nthere with the big garden-syringe, and being thus hemmed in by his\nenemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the\ngreat iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to\nmake his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own\nroom in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.\n\nAfter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins\nlay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\nservants, but it was of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings\nwere so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed\nhis great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had\nbeen engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized a wonderful\nclam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse\neuchre, poker, and other American national games, and Virginia rode\nabout the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire,\nwho had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville\nChase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in\nfact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who,\nin reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best\ncongratulations to the Minister's worthy wife.\n\nThe Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the\nhouse, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let\nmatters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the\nyoung Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had\nonce bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice\nwith the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the\nfloor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state that, though\nhe lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but\n\"Double Sixes.\" The story was well known at the time, though, of course,\nout of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt\nwas made to hush it up, and a full account of all the circumstances\nconnected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle's\nRecollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends. The ghost, then,\nwas naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence\nover the Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his\nown first cousin having been married en secondes noces to the Sieur de\nBulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are\nlineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to\nVirginia's little lover in his celebrated impersonation of \"The Vampire\nMonk, or the Bloodless Benedictine,\" a performance so horrible that when\nold Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in\nthe year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which\nculminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after\ndisinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and\nleaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment,\nhowever, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the\nlittle Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal\nBedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.\n\n\nCHAPTER: V\n\n\nA few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out\nriding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting\nthrough a hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go\nup by the back staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past\nthe Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied\nshe saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother's maid, who\nsometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend\nher habit. To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville\nGhost himself! He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of\nthe yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing\nmadly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his hand, and his\nwhole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so forlorn, and so\nmuch out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea\nhad been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity,\nand determined to try and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so\ndeep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she\nspoke to him.\n\n\"I am so sorry for you,\" she said, \"but my brothers are going back to\nEton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy\nyou.\"\n\n\"It is absurd asking me to behave myself,\" he answered, looking round in\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,\n\"quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and\nwalk about at night, if that is what you mean. It is my only reason for\nexisting.\"\n\n\"It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very\nwicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had\nkilled your wife.\"\n\n\"Well, I quite admit it,\" said the Ghost, petulantly, \"but it was a\npurely family matter, and concerned no one else.\"\n\n\"It is very wrong to kill any one,\" said Virginia, who at times had a\nsweet puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.\n\n\"Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very\nplain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about\ncookery. Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent\npricket, and do you know how she had it sent to table? However, it is\nno matter now, for it is all over, and I don't think it was very nice of\nher brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.\"\n\n\"Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost--I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry? I\nhave a sandwich in my case. Would you like it?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you,\nall the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\nvulgar, dishonest family.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Virginia, stamping her foot, \"it is you who are rude, and\nhorrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the\npaints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain\nin the library. First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and\nI couldn't do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the\nchrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese\nwhite, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing\nto look at, and not at all easy to paint. I never told on you, though I\nwas very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for\nwho ever heard of emerald-green blood?\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" said the Ghost, rather meekly, \"what was I to do? It is\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother\nbegan it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I\nshould not have your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of\ntaste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest\nin England; but I know you Americans don't care for things of this\nkind.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\nand improve your mind. My father will be only too happy to give you a\nfree passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind,\nthere will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are\nall Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\nhave a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family ghost.\"\n\n\"I don't think I should like America.\"\n\n\"I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,\" said Virginia,\nsatirically.\n\n\"No ruins! no curiosities!\" answered the Ghost; \"you have your navy and\nyour manners.\"\n\n\"Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week's\nholiday.\"\n\n\"Please don't go, Miss Virginia,\" he cried; \"I am so lonely and so\nunhappy, and I really don't know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I\ncannot.\"\n\n\"That's quite absurd! You have merely to go to bed and blow out the\ncandle. It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\nchurch, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why, even\nbabies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.\"\n\n\"I have not slept for three hundred years,\" he said sadly, and\nVirginia's beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; \"for three hundred\nyears I have not slept, and I am so tired.\"\n\nVirginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like\nrose-leaves. She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked\nup into his old withered face.\n\n\"Poor, poor Ghost,\" she murmured; \"have you no place where you can\nsleep?\"\n\n\"Far away beyond the pine-woods,\" he answered, in a low, dreamy voice,\n\"there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\nsings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold crystal\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\nsleepers.\"\n\nVirginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\n\n\"You mean the Garden of Death,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth,\nwith the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have\nno yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at\npeace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of death's\nhouse, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death\nis.\"\n\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\nthere was silence. She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\n\nThen the ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of\nthe wind.\n\n\"Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?\"\n\n\"Oh, often,\" cried the little girl, looking up; \"I know it quite well.\n\nIt is painted in curious black letters, and is difficult to read. There\nare only six lines:\n    \"'When a golden girl can win\n    Prayer from out the lips of sin,\n    When the barren almond bears,\n    And a little child gives away its tears,\n    Then shall all the house be still\n    And peace come to Canterville.'\n\n\"But I don't know what they mean.\"\n\n\"They mean,\" he said, sadly, \"that you must weep with me for my sins,\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle,\nthe angel of death will have mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\ncannot prevail.\"\n\nVirginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair\nas he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes. \"I am not afraid,\" she said\nfirmly, \"and I will ask the angel to have mercy on you.\"\n\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as\nhe led her across the dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were\nbroidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back. \"Go back! little Virginia,\"\n\nthey cried, \"go back!\" but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly,\nand she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails\nand goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and\nmurmured, \"Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,\"\n\nbut the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When\nthey reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she\ncould not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly\nfading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A\nbitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her\ndress. \"Quick, quick,\" cried the Ghost, \"or it will be too late,\" and\nin a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry\nChamber was empty.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VI\n\n\nAbout ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not\ncome down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia\nanywhere. As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\nevening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all\nalarmed at first, but when six o'clock struck, and Virginia did not\nappear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for\nher, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house. At\nhalf-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\nof their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of\nexcitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly\nremembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies\npermission to camp in the park. He accordingly at once set off for\nBlackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son\nand two of the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire, who was\nperfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too,\nbut Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a\nscuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gipsies had\ngone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as\nthe fire was still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.\n\nHaving sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran\nhome, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the\ncounty, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been\nkidnapped by tramps or gipsies. He then ordered his horse to be brought\nround, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down\nto dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with a groom. He had hardly,\nhowever, gone a couple of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after\nhim, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with\nhis face very flushed, and no hat. \"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,\" gasped\nout the boy, \"but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.\n\nPlease don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year,\nthere would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me back,\nwill you? I can't go! I won't go!\"\n\nThe Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace,\nand was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down\nfrom his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, \"Well,\nCecil, if you won't go back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must\nget you a hat at Ascot.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!\" cried the little Duke, laughing,\nand they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of\nthe station-master if any one answering to the description of Virginia\nhad been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her. The\nstation-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him\nthat a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a\nhat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his\nshutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away,\nwhich he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as there was a\nlarge common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman, but\ncould get no information from him, and, after riding all over the\ncommon, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase\nabout eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found\nWashington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with\nlanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest trace of\nVirginia had been discovered. The gipsies had been caught on Brockley\nmeadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they should be late. Indeed, they had\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's disappearance, as they\nwere very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his\npark, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search.\n\nThe carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone\nover, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any\nrate, Virginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest\ndepression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they\nfound a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\nwas poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and\nhaving her forehead bathed with eau de cologne by the old housekeeper.\n\nMr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up\nsupper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one\nspoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very\nfond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the\nentreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that\nnothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in\nthe morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down\nimmediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight\nbegan to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded\nthey heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder\nshook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a\npanel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out\non the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her\nhand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs.\nOtis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with\nviolent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.\n\n\"Good heavens! child, where have you been?\" said Mr. Otis, rather\nangrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them.\n\n\"Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and\nyour mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these\npractical jokes any more.\"\n\n\"Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!\" shrieked the twins, as they\ncapered about.\n\n\"My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side\nagain,\" murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair.\n\n\"Papa,\" said Virginia, quietly, \"I have been with the Ghost. He is dead,\nand you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was\nreally sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of\nbeautiful jewels before he died.\"\n\nThe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave\nand serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a\nlighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they\ncame to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia\ntouched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves\nin a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated\nwindow. Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was\na gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone\nfloor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers\nan old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its\nreach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was\ncovered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but\na pile of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding\nher little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the\nparty looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\ndisclosed to them.\n\n\"Hallo!\" suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out\nof the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\nsituated. \"Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.\"\n\n\"God has forgiven him,\" said Virginia, gravely, as she rose to her feet,\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.\n\n\"What an angel you are!\" cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round\nher neck, and kissed her.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VII\n\n\nFour days after these curious incidents, a funeral started from\nCanterville Chase at about eleven o'clock at night. The hearse was drawn\nby eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\nnodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\npurple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville\ncoat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\nservants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully\nimpressive. Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up\nspecially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first\ncarriage along with little Virginia. Then came the United States\nMinister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the\nlast carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had\nbeen frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she\nhad a right to see the last of him. A deep grave had been dug in the\ncorner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service\nwas read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, the servants, according to an old custom\nobserved in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as\nthe coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward,\nand laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms. As\nshe did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its\nsilent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a\nnightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of the\nGarden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a\nword during the drive home.\n\nThe next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given\nto Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby\nnecklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen\nof sixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis\nfelt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"I know that in this country mortmain is held to\napply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that\nthese jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg\nyou, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you\nunder certain strange conditions. As for my daughter, she is merely a\nchild, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such\nappurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I\nmay say, is no mean authority upon Art,--having had the privilege of\nspending several winters in Boston when she was a girl,--that these gems\nare of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\nprice. Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you\nwill recognize how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\nin the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such\nvain gauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\nBritish aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who\nhave been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles\nof Republican simplicity. Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box, as a memento of\nyour unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is extremely old, and\nconsequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to\ncomply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good deal\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with medi\u00e6valism\nin any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was\nborn in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned\nfrom a trip to Athens.\"\n\nLord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister's speech,\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile,\nand when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\nsaid: \"My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky\nancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are\nmuch indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck. The jewels\nare clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough\nto take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave\nin a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. As for their being\nheirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or\nlegal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite\nunknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and\nwhen Miss Virginia grows up, I dare say she will be pleased to have\npretty things to wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the\nfurniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to\nthe ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity\nSir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he\nwas really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase.\"\n\nMr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville's refusal, and\nbegged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was\nquite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to\nretain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of\n1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's first\ndrawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the\nuniversal theme of admiration. For Virginia received the coronet, which\nis the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her\nboy-lover as soon as he came of age. They were both so charming, and\nthey loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the\nmatch, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch\nthe Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less\nthan three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to\nsay, Mr. Otis himself. Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke\npersonally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his\nown words, \"was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating\ninfluences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of\nRepublican simplicity should be forgotten.\" His objections, however,\nwere completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the\naisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his\narm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of\nEngland.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to\nCanterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over\nin the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods. There had\nbeen a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir\nSimon's tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it\nsimply the initials of the old gentleman's name, and the verse from the\nlibrary window. The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses,\nwhich she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for\nsome time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There\nthe Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her\nfeet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly\nhe threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her,\n\"Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.\"\n\n\"Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have,\" he answered, smiling, \"you have never told me what\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.\"\n\n\"I have never told any one, Cecil,\" said Virginia, gravely.\n\n\"I know that, but you might tell me.\"\n\n\"Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you. Poor Sir Simon! I owe\nhim a great deal. Yes, don't laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see\nwhat Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than\nboth.\"\n\nThe Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.\n\n\"You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,\" he murmured.\n\n\"You have always had that, Cecil.\"\n\n\"And you will tell our children some day, won't you?\"\n\nVirginia blushed.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.\n\nYet Millet would have us understand that in spite of this, the\nshepherd is performing a duty to humanity not to be underrated. The\nsheep he has so carefully and conscientiously reared will form food\nto-morrow for many a hungry town-dweller. Further, he would have us\nfollow the peasant as he closes the pen for the night and traces his\ntired steps towards his simple home in the village. The frugal and\nhard-earned meal, prepared for him by his wife, who like himself has\nhad her share of duties to occupy her during the day, is partaken of\nsurrounded by a hungry and joyous group of children. Such themes\nsuggested by the simplicity of his own life appealed to him with\nirresistible force, and it is in their portrayal that his greatness is\nmanifested.\n\nPerhaps no season of the year presented the same attraction for Millet\nas the spring. The period when all the earth after its long winter\nsleep is about to waken into new life seems to have always been a\nsource of inspiration to him. In \"The Sower\" he emphasises the fact\nthat the fruits of the harvest are not to be had without due labour\nbeing expended upon the earth. The sloping field, barren of\nvegetation, and crowned at the top with a small clump of trees, is\nbeing broken up by the distant plough drawn by two horses and guided\nby a peasant. The latter figure is one of the noblest of Millet's\ncreations. By his strained and ever-attentive attitude, by his\ncontinuous tramp over the rough and broken ground, he shows us the\nmonotony of his toil. He crosses the field in one direction, only to\nreturn at an interval of a few feet. In the foreground we have the\nsower, a middle-aged man of typical peasant type, on whose left side a\nbag of seeds is slung. With automatic precision he withdraws a\nhandful, and strews it into the furrows open to receive it. So long as\nhe continues in the same track his labour will be well performed, and\nhence his task is just as monotonous as that of his fellow-worker\nhigher up in the field. The silhouetting of these two figures against\nthe light is symbolical of the labour to be expended in life before\nresults are forthcoming.\n\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that in considering the works of\nMillet, one must not judge him from the standpoint of a mere painter.\n\nHis brush is only the means to an end, and by its means he is enabled\nto bring the fruits of his philosophic observation before us in\npermanent form. It has been charged against the \"Angelus\" that it was\nnot a remarkably fine piece of painting, that many a young artist of\nthe present generation is infinitely better equipped, technically\nspeaking, than the master who wrought this celebrated canvas. This may\nin a measure be true, but it must never be forgotten that Millet\nbrought into play exactly the means which could illustrate his meaning\nin the clearest terms. He had not intended, in painting such a\npicture, to produce a work which would astonish his fellow artists\nwith its brilliancy of handling or magnificence of colour. He wanted\nto make the beholder forget the painter and absorb the lesson. This\nquality runs right through the art of Millet, and it is from this\nstandpoint that we are obliged to weigh his merits.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE\n\n\nJean Fran\u00e7ois Millet was born on October 4, 1814, that is at the\nperiod when French art, at any rate as far as landscape painting is\nconcerned, had reached its lowest ebb. Throughout the eighteenth\ncentury the landscape painter had been hard put to make a living. The\ntaste of connoisseurs throughout the century had been for portraits\nand interiors, or for those numerous pastoral subjects which were\ncarried out with so much decorative charm by such men as Watteau and\nBoucher. Such landscape painting as existed was of the type\npopularised by Vernet; it was built upon a curious mixture of Italian\ninfluence coming from Panini and Salvator Rosa. The only evidence of\nrevolt against such a state of affairs we find in the works of Hubert\nRobert and Moreau. These two, and more especially would I direct the\nreader's attention to the latter, struggled hard to break down the\nconventionalities of the time. They endeavoured to infuse some sense\nof atmosphere into their pictures, and whilst frequently their trees\nand figures are painfully formal, they yet stand alone in the French\nschool as the pioneers of a phase of art which was to attain its\nzenith in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBut after the Revolution, and during the whole of the time that France\nwas under the domination of Napoleon, very rigid principles indeed\nwere enforced with regard to the direction that art should take. The\ninnovation which had its commencement in the reign of Louis XVI. swept\neverything before it as it gained force. Classical art and traditions\ndominated the whole French school, and no artist, however great his\nreputation, attempted for many years to swim against the stream. In\nspite of the principles of liberty and equality which were claimed for\nall under the new r\u00e9gime, a terribly strict eye was kept upon any\ninnovations which might break out in the form of a naturalistic art.\n\nThe directors of this new movement failed to see that the conditions\nwhich had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed\naway, and that the latter's supremacy was due to the fact that their\nproductions were symbolical of the loftiest thoughts of their own\nepoch. The art which expresses the ambitions and noblest thoughts of\nits time will alone endure. These expressions are not applicable to\nany other condition than those which called them forth, and hence in\nattempting to purify the rococo which had existed up to the middle of\nthe eighteenth century, by a return to classical traditions, they were\nonly copying that which their predecessors had done, and in so doing\nleft us without any original expression of their own time.\n\nInto such a condition of affairs was Millet born, and he was numbered\namongst that little band of men which included Rousseau, Corot, Dupr\u00e9,\nDiaz, and Daumier, who were to lay the foundations of the modern\nnaturalistic school. At the outset it was seemingly a hopeless\nstruggle they undertook; a struggle against prejudice and influence\nwhich was only to be brought to a victorious culmination after years\nof struggle and disappointment. Of this little band, Millet was\nperhaps the best equipped for the privations which were necessary. He\ncame of a peasant stock who inhabited Gruchy, a small village\nsituated in the commune of Gr\u00e9ville, close to Cherbourg. Grouped\nunderneath the humble roof was the grandmother, who had been left a\nwidow fifteen years before; her son, Jean Louis Nicolas Millet, and\nhis wife and eight children, of which our artist was the second. His\ngrandmother appears to have been a pious old lady, whose chief delight\nwas in her grandchildren, to whom she taught those religious\nprinciples which stood them in good stead in after life. We are told\nthat Millet's father possessed a force of character one does not often\nfind amongst men in his rank of life. He was of a contemplative\ndisposition, and had a keenly developed feeling for natural beauty. He\npossessed moreover a keen appreciation of music, which unfortunately\nhe does not appear to have had much opportunity of cultivating. His\nwife was an excellent housewife and of a religious turn of mind. The\nhouse they occupied, situated quite a short distance from the sea, was\nplaced in a tract of country which, whilst it had rugged and\npicturesque features, was not of a nature which would yield\nextraordinary results under cultivation. It was, therefore, a hard\nstruggle for existence which Millet in his first years saw going\non around him. Not that the family were any the less happy for having\nto work laboriously for their livelihood. They had been brought up\namidst such surroundings; their wants were simple and easily\ngratified, and the tranquillity of the m\u00e9nage more than\ncounterbalanced those doubtful luxuries which easier circumstances\nwould have brought their way. Throughout his life Millet maintained\nthe extreme simplicity he had seen practised in the home of his\nchildhood, and long years afterwards he was accustomed to look back\nwith pleasureable memories upon his early years.\n\nGruchy, situated in one of the wildest parts of Normandy, feels the\nfull effect of every storm which blows up from the Atlantic. There is\nnothing to shelter the exposed hamlets studded along the coast from\nthe fury of the western gale, and the rocks are but too often strewn\nwith the wrecks of vessels which have come to grief in that terrible\nsea. Millet in his youth must have witnessed many of these\ncatastrophes. Quite a number of drawings by him are extant\nrepresenting succour being extended to some vessel in difficulties, or\nthe hauling up of some wreckage on to the rocks. The studious boy\nmust have been impressed as he saw the sternness of the combat in his\nnative country between men and nature; the wind-swept fields, and\nhills bare to the point of savageness. The very trees themselves\ndwarfed and gnarled; in their struggle with the elements they have\nbeen made tough and hardy as the inhabitants of the country\nthemselves, and, stunted as they are, yet show well that they can\nresist the force of the fiercest storm. The brooding and contemplative\ncharacter of the father having descended to the son, we can quite\nimagine the effect such surroundings would have upon him. As he looked\nback in after years upon his roamings in his native country, he\nappreciated the awe-inspiring character of the scenery in which he had\nbeen born. He would doubtless recall many a walk amidst the fields\nwith the wind blowing in his face as it rushed in from the Atlantic,\nthe rain beating hard upon the freshly ploughed fields, and the\ndistant figure of the ploughman struggling hard with his team against\nthe stiff sou'wester. The great mass of vapour overhead whirled before\nthe violence of the storm, casting grey and pearly light over the\nwhole scene, whilst far away on the top of the hill a clump of trees,\nbent with their resistance to the wind, are silhouetted against the\nsky. Many a drawing of this kind we encounter in the later work of\nMillet, which shows how his thoughts harked back in certain moments to\nthe scenes he had left behind him for ever.\n\nWe know that on one or two occasions he returned to Gruchy. Once or\ntwice he had urgent business which took him back, but sometimes he\nwent with no other purpose than to renew acquaintance with the scenes\nof yore.\n\nLittle Jean Fran\u00e7ois was his grandmother's favourite. It was she who\ntaught him the names of things which surrounded him, and perhaps\ndirected his thoughts in the channels to which they were finally to be\ndevoted. Her brother Charles, who formed one of the family, used to\ntake him for walks, telling him stories on the way. Millet was\ndevotedly attached to this old man, and when at the age of seven years\nhe lost him, the gap in his life thus left made an impression upon his\nmemory never to be effaced.\n\nFive years afterwards he was placed in the hands of the vicar for the\npurpose of preparing him for his first communion. The good man seems\nto have been taken with the child; he found him so attentive to all\nnatural phenomenon which was passing around him and intelligent in an\nunusual degree. He quickly learnt a considerable amount of Latin,\nwhich introduced him to the great classics. Unfortunately for Millet,\nthe vicar accepted an offer of transference to a better parish in the\nvicinity. The boy had made such progress with his master that it was\ndecided that he should go with him to his new abode. He was, however,\nso missed in his own home, that when he came back for his first\nholidays it was decided that he should not return.\n\nHe now gave serious attention to the agricultural pursuits of his\nfather. He threw himself heartily into the work of the farm, and\nassisted in the work of sowing and harvesting, of pruning and\nthrashing according to the season. His spare time was occupied in\nreading with avidity various masterpieces of literature. The authors\nhe found at hand were such as F\u00e9n\u00e9lon and Bossuet, but he developed a\ndecided preference, which lasted till the end of his life, for Virgil\nand the Bible.\n\nIt was at this time that his taste for art began to be developed.\n\nHe drew the objects he found around him, and soon acquired sufficient\nconfidence in his skill to execute a large drawing representing two\nshepherds keeping guard over their sheep. These first efforts date\nfrom about his seventeenth year, and foretell the advent of the style\nin which he was later to become pre-eminent.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE MIGRATION TO PARIS\n\n\nHow frequently has it happened that the first years in the life of a\ngenius have been employed in labour quite different from that to which\nthey should have been directed. Such a state of affairs the more often\noccurs when the sense of duty has been strong enough to overcome\ntemporarily the inclination to pursue the natural bent. In the case of\nMillet, however, the early years which he devoted to the farm and its\npursuits were by no means wasted. It is on record that he became very\nproficient in the various duties in which he was engaged, but at the\nsame time we can be quite sure that his extraordinary faculties of\nobservation were constantly being brought into play, and the fruits of\nhis observations are to be seen in the pictures of his mature period.\n\nA considerable portion of his spare time was taken up with drawing,\nnot only the persons and objects he found around him, but also\nsubjects suggested to him by the books he was in the habit of reading.\n\nHis family, so far from throwing any obstacles in his way, encouraged\nhim. In fact it was his father who took him first to Cherbourg in\norder to show a painter of that town, named Mouchel, the early\nproducts of his son's genius. The decision at which Millet p\u00e8re had\narrived was prompted by a drawing in charcoal of an old peasant\nwalking along the road, which had struck him forcibly as being a work\nof extraordinary merit. It says much for Mouchel's breadth of mind\nthat he was equally impressed with the drawings. A man who had been\nbrought up in the school of David, and who had lived in one of the\nmost reactionary periods of French art, was hardly to be expected to\ntake kindly to a style so diametrically opposed to all the traditions\ninto which he himself had been inculcated; certainly the young\nMillet, who had now arrived at the age of eighteen, had not developed\nthe extraordinary freedom which his works of ten years later\ndemonstrate. But there was sufficient originality even in his early\ndrawings to call forth condemnation from a man who had been so\nsaturated with the teaching of David.\n\nHe prevailed upon Millet to leave his son with him, and set him to\nwork to copy many well-known works of art which he brought before his\npupil by means of engravings. Two months were spent in this way when\nnews reached Millet that his father had been seized with sudden\nillness, and he was obliged in the circumstances to return to\nGr\u00e9ville. He arrived to find the old man unconscious, and very shortly\nafterwards he died.\n\nThis misfortune awoke in Millet a sense of duty which compelled him to\ndesert his studies in Cherbourg and superintend the management of the\nfarm. For some time he devoted himself entirely to his new duties, but\nthe struggle betwixt duty and genius continued; he gave himself to his\nwork with all the energy at his disposal, but his thoughts were ever\nwandering to his art.\n\nAdded to his own inclinations, his grandmother, who perceived his\nextraordinary gifts, strongly persuaded him to devote his attention\nentirely to art, and consequently after some little time he decided to\nreturn to Cherbourg. Here he entered the studio of M. Langlois, an\nartist whose reputation in the town was considerable. Again in this\nworthy man he came in contact with a painter who had been brought up\nentirely under classical influence. Langlois, who had in his early\ndays been a pupil of Gros, had absorbed the classical tradition to\nsuch an extent as to be incapable of appreciating any other style. He\nappears to have endeavoured to mould Millet in his own method rather\nthan develop the latent genius which the latter possessed. The\nincompatibility of these two men speedily caused the younger to strike\nout in his own way. He saw more good in frequenting the museums and\nmaking copies of such works as appealed to him than in listening to\nthe advice of his teacher. All this occurred, however, without any\nbreach of friendship occurring. On the contrary, Langlois, after\nperceiving the futility of inducing his pupil to follow in his\nfootsteps, did all he could to advance his interests.\n\nBy means of his influence some of Millet's drawings were brought\nbefore the Municipal Council, and Langlois suggested that Millet\nshould be sent to Paris in order to further his development, and that\nthe Council should set aside a modest pension to meet his requirements\nin that city. The discussion appears to have been very prolonged, and\nupon the question being put to a vote it was only carried by means of\nthe casting vote of the mayor. Four hundred francs was at first\nallotted to him in this way, which was further increased shortly\nafterwards to six hundred. Such encouragement, meagre though it was,\nwas sufficient to give him a foothold in the metropolis. He left\nCherbourg in January 1837, on a cold and raw day, the snow falling\nheavily throughout the entire journey, and arrived in Paris in a very\ndisheartened condition. The miserable weather, coupled with the long\njourney in which he had had time to think of the small sum which lay\nbetween him and starvation, going to a city which he had never seen\nbefore, had all served to work upon his nerves, and he entered the\ngreat city sick at heart and very despondent.\n\nOne of the first visits he made after he was somewhat settled down in\nParis was to the Louvre. Here he was brought into contact for the\nfirst time with many masters, who were to mould his yet plastic\ntemperament into the form which enabled him to give to the world, in\nlater years, so many masterpieces. As I have said before, it was\nMantegna who first captivated him, and the influence of the mighty\nPaduan was never finally to be shaken off. Michel Angelo awed him with\nhis sublimity; his classical severity tempered with intense humanism,\nhis masculine strength, were bound to have their effect upon so\nserious a character as Millet. Strange as it may seem to those who are\nbut superficially acquainted with his art, and are only too apt to\njudge him by the influence he has had upon modern French painting, he\nwas fascinated with the antique. The traditions of Phidias and\nPraxiteles, in the form in which they had been transmitted through the\ngreatest minds of the Renaissance, were ever the factors which guided\nhim throughout his career. It was this same spirit which impelled his\nfervid admiration for Nicolas Poussin, a master who to-day is sadly\nunderrated and but little understood. It was the mysteries of line,\nthe wonders of pose and composition rather than the magic of colour\nwhich appealed to him. He had a profound admiration for the glowing\ncanvases of Titian and Rubens, but he could never overlook entirely\ntheir defects of drawing or, in the case of Rubens, the tendency to\nvulgarity. From his remarks in after years it would appear that he was\nbaffled with the mysticisms of Velazquez and Rembrandt; pure painting\nitself could never hold him. He needed to grasp the message which lay\nbehind it before he felt fully taken into the confidence of the\npainter; and as the minds of the Dutchman and the Spaniard ran in\nquite different channels to his own, they spoke with a language he\nnever understood. That he had a perceptive and critically independent\nmind may be gauged from his enthusiasm for Delacroix, whose work he\nencountered for the first time at the Luxembourg.\n\nDuring this period of study he was carefully considering under what\nmaster he should place himself. His choice unhappily fell upon\nDelaroche. To any one acquainted with the work of the latter master,\na more unsuitable selection could not have been made. Delaroche and\nthe painters who surrounded him can be appropriately described as\nconstituting the back-wash of the Empire style, which had reached its\nclimax with David. His subjects were always treated with academic\nreserve. No pyrotechnics were permitted; on the contrary, an\neverlasting and mistaken striving for finish was encouraged:\noriginality was sternly suppressed. To paint human life as it really\nwas, was too vulgar for any of the painters of this time. They held\nthe public taste enslaved for years. An innovator such as Millet was\ndestined to become found his position almost untenable. The band of\ncritics and painters formed a monopoly which it seemed almost\nimpossible to break down, and it was only after years of bitter and\ndetermined struggle that the school of nature finally routed its\nopponent.\n\nDelaroche doubtlessly found the peasant painter a little rude both in\nhis person and in his ideas about art. He paid but little attention to\nthe young man who had placed himself in his hands, and devoted all his\ntime to students who were more amenable to his influence. A\ntemperament so sensitive as Millet's was bound to notice this\nneglect, and consequently after a time he became so discouraged that\nhe ceased to frequent Delaroche's studio. Another very good reason for\nthis action was the lack of resources to continue his payments. Even\nduring the time he had been with Delaroche he lost no opportunity of\nturning a few honest francs by painting the portraits of any who could\nbe got to sit to him. Delaroche, however, had a more kindly heart than\nMillet imagined. He seems to have found out the real distress of the\nyoung artist, and to have assisted him pecuniarily in many ways, and\nthere is no doubt that he appreciated the talent of the young Norman\nmuch more than he cared to own. Many of his remarks on record would\nserve to show that Delaroche already felt that his pupil was destined\nto be one of the leaders of the movement which was finally to\noverthrow his own style, and doubtlessly felt a great admiration for a\nman who had the courage and strength to swim against rather than with\nthe current.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STRUGGLE FOR RECOGNITION\n\n\nFreed from all encumbrances save poverty, Millet was now to work out\nhis own destiny according to the dictates of his genius. He joined a\nfriend named Marolle, and the two together occupying a very small\napartment endeavoured to eke out an existence. It was only too soon\napparent that young as he was, and the taste of the public being not\nyet ready for development upon the lines his genius directed him, that\nhis livelihood could not be secured by endeavouring to sell such\nsubjects as appealed to him. In these straits he turned to\nportrait-painting, just as many great painters before and since him\nhave done. That the struggle was very keen can well be imagined by the\nfact that he was unable to obtain more than five to ten francs apiece;\nand, as commissions were very scarce, he was hard put to gain the\nmeans of subsistence. This state of affairs lasted until 1840, in\nwhich year he endeavoured to obtain admission to the Salon with two\nportraits, one of which was that of his friend. This, however, was\nrejected, and the other picture, although accepted, was unnoticed by\neither the critics or the public.\n\nHaving occasion the next year to pay a visit to Cherbourg, he felt\nobliged to report himself to the Municipal Council who had had the\ngenerosity to send him in the first place to Paris. Its worthy members\nexpressed themselves as but little satisfied with the result of their\ninvestment; they claimed that they had had as yet but little to show\nfor their money, and they suggested, partly as a means of\ndemonstrating that they had had some little return, and also, in order\nto see of what stuff their prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was made, that he should paint a\nportrait of the recently deceased mayor. As Millet had not been\npersonally acquainted with that worthy citizen, and as the only guide\nwhich could be supplied him was a portrait made in miniature when he\nwas a young man of some twenty-three or twenty-four years of age, the\ntask was by no means easy. However, the artist set to work with a\nwill, and finally accomplished the picture to his own satisfaction.\n\nUpon it being shown to the Council, one and all declared, as any one\nwith the slightest knowledge of such matters could have told them\nbefore it was commenced, that it bore not the least resemblance to the\ndefunct magistrate. They therefore demurred at the three hundred\nfrancs they had agreed to pay him for the portrait, and offered him\none-third of that amount instead. Millet was deeply offended by the\ninsult, and informed the Council that he made them a present of the\npicture.\n\nIt was during this short visit to his native country that he met his\nfirst wife, a Mlle. Ono, whose portrait he had painted. From the first\nshe was very delicate, and he lost her after much suffering, three\nyears later. His second wife was Mlle. Catherine Lemaire, who was\ndestined to be the companion of his struggles until the end of his\nlife.\n\nMeanwhile Millet was occupied with subjects which he thought would\nappeal to the general public. A number of classical pictures date from\nthis epoch. It was an endeavour on his part to fall in as far as\npossible with the current taste, and so supply means of subsistence\nfor his family. At the same time he did not neglect his favourite\nsubjects, and many are the wonderful studies of peasant life which\ndate from these years. His reputation had so far advanced that he was\noffered the position of teacher of drawing in the college at\nCherbourg. It must have been only after prolonged deliberation that he\nrefused the proffered post. Here a certain annual stipend was assured\nhim, and if it was not large in itself it would at any rate suffice to\nkeep the wolf from the door. He preferred, however, to return to Paris\nand work out his own destiny as best he might.\n\nMillet, who lived at this time in the Rue Rochechouart, began to\nsurround himself with that little group of friends who remained\nfaithful to him until the end of his career. Amongst the earliest were\nCharles Jacque and Diaz: the latter had several clients amongst the\nsmall dealers, whom he induced to visit Millet's studio and make now\nand again a small purchase.\n\nMillet now became a fairly regular contributor to the Salon, but\ngenerally sent some classical or religious picture as well as one of\nhis peasant subjects. For example, in 1848 he sent the marvellous\nstudy of \"The Winnower,\" which we all know so well, accompanied by a\ncanvas, \"The Captivity of the Jews at Babylon.\" The latter, however,\nwas so badly received that he utilised the canvas upon its return for\na large picture of a \"Shepherdess tending her Sheep.\"\n\nIn spite of the headway that he was making, the struggle for existence\nseemed keener than ever, and but for the kindness of friends he and\nhis family would frequently have actually wanted for food. A timely\nadvance of one hundred francs obtained for him from the Minister of\nFine Arts, together with a commission from the State, for which he was\npaid the sum of eighteen hundred francs, were for some time the only\nrelief he obtained from his embarrassments. That he was not particular\nas to how he earned his daily bread is apparent from the fact that he\ndid not despise an order for a shop sign for a midwife, for which he\nwas paid the miserable amount of thirty francs.\n\nThe year 1848 was not an encouraging one for a painter who was\nstanding on the threshold of his career. The whole of Europe was\nseething with revolution. A repetition of the fearful year of 1792 was\neverywhere expected. The struggle betwixt reaction and property on the\none hand, and lawlessness and revolution on the other, was being waged\nwith grim determination. The issue was for long in the balance. One\nnever knew from one day to another what was going to happen. In such a\ndeplorable state of affairs men's minds were running on politics and\nwars rather than upon art. Millet amongst the rest was called upon to\nshoulder the musket, and it can be easily imagined with what\nreluctance he did so.\n\nParis, the great centre of art, had yet not afforded him much\nencouragement. Life was dear in the big city, and surrounded on all\nsides by bricks and mortar he was not free to go out into the fields\nand study the objects which were uppermost in his mind. He resolved to\nescape from it, and once having put the plan into execution he never\nreturned.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET IN HIS MATURITY\n\n\nThe Barbizon of 1850 was a very different place from the Barbizon of\nto-day. The world fame of the men who passed a quiet and strenuous\nexistence in the little village has transformed it into a tourist\nresort, with restaurants and caf\u00e9s, the stopping-places for\nwaggonettes which in summer bring their daily load of sightseers,\neager to see the homes of the painters whose names are now household\nwords.\n\nIt would have been well-nigh impossible for the little band to have\nchosen a more suitable spot for their labours. Rousseau and Millet,\nmuch as they were drawn towards each other by the tie of a sympathetic\ndisposition and by their common interest in art, yet were widely\ndissimilar from one another in their outlook upon art and their\nmethods of worship at the common shrine. Rousseau--one can see it from\nevery picture he painted--loved with all the yearning of a passionate\nand restless temperament the inanimate in Nature. Observe with what\nfidelity he draws his trees, with what caressing tenderness his clouds\nand skies are treated; solitude appealed to him above all things, and\nif here and there he was obliged to insert a few figures to complete\nhis composition, one instinctively feels that he would rather have\nsubstituted a group of cattle or a flock of sheep. In the glades of\nthe forest, far from the busy haunts of men, with the glorious\nsunlight penetrating from above, the breeze moaning through the\nbranches, he was happy. A wild and turbulent temperament such as his\nnot infrequently discovers exquisite enjoyment amidst such perfect\ntranquillity.\n\nBarbizon, situated on the fringe of the great forest of Fontainebleau,\ntherefore, permitted Rousseau to come into daily contact with the\nscenes which so appealed to him.\n\nMillet, on the other hand, was absorbed in the peasant. The man who\ntilled the soil and raised the produce humanity requires for its\nsubsistence by the sweat of his brow; the manifold duties of the\nlabourer, his life and sorrows, appealed to him with irresistible\nforce. An unpeopled track of wild and uncultivated land would not call\nforth any emotion in him, no matter how sublime the scenery might be.\n\nThe life of the village, spreading itself into the vast and fertile\nplain behind, held him absorbed; a peasant himself and living amongst\nthe people he so loved, he was in a position to bring before an\nunthinking world the poignant monotony of their useful lives.\n\nUpon their first arrival at Barbizon, the two artists put up at a\nsmall inn, working all day in a tiny place they had rented from some\npeasants and fitted up as a studio. The inconveniences of this\narrangement were soon apparent, and shortly afterwards Millet took a\nsmall house which was destined to be his abode for the remainder of\nhis life; an old barn in the immediate vicinity meanwhile provided him\nwith an excellent studio.\n\nFrom this period onward we must date the greatest productions of the\nmaster, the works which have induced more thought than those of any\nother peasant painter. A peasant among peasants, his life was of the\nmost rigid simplicity. Behind his little abode a large garden\nstretched away almost to the fringe of the forest itself, and here he\nwas accustomed to work every morning, growing a portion of the food\nnecessary to the sustenance of his family. The afternoon he devoted to\npainting, whilst the evening was given over to intercourse with his\nlittle circle of friends. The simplicity and tranquillity of his life\naroused the whole of his powers to action, and surrounded with\neverything he valued in life he was supremely happy.\n\nThe country around Barbizon appealed to him irresistibly. The\ntimber-studded plains, the gently undulating, highly cultivated\nfields, presented a strange contrast to the wild and rugged country\namidst which he had spent his childhood, and no doubt conduced to the\ndevelopment of a more refined and contemplative style than he would\notherwise have acquired. Upon his few visits to his native country he\nappears to have been more impressed than ever with its austerity, and\nthe drawings which these journeys called forth bore ample evidence of\nthis feeling in him.\n\nLack of the necessary funds to carry on even his simple m\u00e9nage was\never the bane of Millet's life. On many occasions Sensier, his\nintimate friend and afterwards his biographer, informs us he dissuaded\nhim from suicide.\n\nThe sums that he owed, small though they were, rendered him in\nconstant fear of the brokers. With creditors so importunate in their\ndemands for satisfaction, and with the constant lack of recognition,\nwhich was his lot, it is astonishing that Millet achieved so much. He\nwas relieved more than once by the kind-hearted and ever faithful\nRousseau, who when his friend was sorest pressed found some delicately\nhidden means to relieve him. It was he who acquired for 4000 francs\nthe wonderful \"Peasant grafting a Tree,\" when the picture failed to\nfind a purchaser; and in order that Millet should not be aware of his\ngenerosity, he made the offer in the name of an imaginary American.\n\nThis sort of goodness he repeated more than once, and it redounds\nstill more to his credit when we remember that Rousseau himself was\nnot infrequently in pecuniary difficulties.\n\nA constant succession of important works made their appearance during\nthe first ten years Millet spent at Barbizon. The first was the\nwell-known \"Sower,\" which has ever been one of the most popular of his\npictures. Then came the far finer \"Peasants going to Work,\" which for\nmany years was in an English Collection. The \"Gleaners,\" perhaps the\nnoblest canvas the master ever painted, dates from 1857, in which year\nit was seen at the Salon; the celebrated \"Angelus\" followed it two\nyears later. The prices which Millet obtained for this series of\nremarkable works was fantastically small. The \"Gleaners\" brought him a\npaltry 2000 francs, whilst he accounted himself lucky to encounter an\namateur who gave him the same sum for the small \"Woman feeding Fowls.\"\n\nThe \"Angelus,\" which was never exhibited, was sold in the year it was\npainted to a Monsieur Feydeau, an architect, for 1800 francs. It then\npassed through several hands before the late Monsieur Secr\u00e9tan\ncompeted up to 160,000 francs before he became possessed of the prize\nat the John Wilson sale.\n\nThe purchase, however, proved a sound investment, for upon the\ndispersal of his collection it was knocked down for 553,000 francs to\na Monsieur Proust, acting on behalf of the French Government. The\nlatter, however, when they gave the commission to buy the picture, had\nno idea that such a high value would be placed upon it, and\nconsequently refused to ratify the sale; a syndicate now came upon the\nscene, who took it to America. The price, however, proved greater than\neven the millionaires of the States were prepared to give, and the\ncanvas again returned to France, where it found a resting-place in the\ncollection of Monsieur Chauchard, who paid the enormous sum of 800,000\nfrancs for its possession.\n\nIn 1859 Millet sent two works to the Salon, a \"Woman grazing her Cow,\"\nand \"Death and the Woodman.\" The latter, one of the most\nphilosophical of Millet's pictures, which to-day is the principal\nattraction of the Jacobsen Museum at Copenhagen, was rejected.\n\nDisappointments of this kind came with such systematic regularity to\nthe painter that he must have become proof against them. He always had\nbitter enemies amongst the critics, who never failed to pour abuse\nupon his method and his subjects. Even a number of his fellow artists\njoined in the chorus of disapproval. But the vehemence with which he\nwas attacked was striking evidence of the impression he was making and\nthe inward sense of his own powers; and the fact that he was working\nout his destiny according to the dictates of his own genius supported\nhim against this outpouring of prejudice and malice. The social side\nof life appealed to him more strongly as the years rolled on, and the\nmurmurings which had been heard in 1859 as to the socialistic\ntendencies of \"Death and the Woodman\" swelled to a roar when the\nstupendous \"Man with the Hoe\" was exhibited fourteen years later. The\nlatter, one of the most virile studies of depraved humanity which the\nworld has ever seen, has always been a favourite with social\nreformers, and has inspired one remarkable poem. Even his most\nimplacable critics were disarmed before this canvas; its power was\nmagnetic; it was an inspiration, soul moving and trenchant.\n\nHis financial difficulties never completely dispersed. At one time, in\norder to insure himself a little tranquillity, he made a contract with\ntwo speculators, whereby they were to become possessors of all the\nwork he produced for three years, in consideration of their assuring\nhim a thousand francs a month. A great number of Millet's finest\nproductions passed thus through their hands, including the \"Return\nfrom the Fields\" and the \"Man with the Hoe.\" The partners were not\nlong in quarrelling, and after a lawsuit had been fought, Millet was\nleft in the hands of a man who frequently would not or could not pay\nhim in ready money, and whose bills he was frequently forced to\ndiscount at considerable loss.\n\nOne little gleam of sunshine rendered his later days happy. This was a\ncommission from a Colmar banker, Monsieur Thomas by name, who required\nfour allegorical compositions representing the Seasons, to decorate\nhis rooms. The artist was overjoyed by this piece of good fortune,\nand immediately commenced a most conscientious study of such mural\ndecoration as was within reach, in order that he might do full justice\nto his patron. He paid frequent visits to Fontainebleau and the\nLouvre, and even desired a friend to inquire if he could not obtain\nreproductions of the frescoes at Herculaneum and Pompeii. In spite of\nall this elaborate preparation, the subjects were not such as appealed\nto his genius, and in spite of them being well and soundly painted, we\nare told that they presented no features which called for special\ncomment.\n\nHe found, however, a much more genial occupation in accomplishing a\nseries of drawings ordered by a Monsieur Gavet, who paid the artist\n1000, 700, and 450 francs each, according to their size. He made\naltogether ninety-five drawings in this way, and it is said that this\ngentleman had in his possession the finest work in black and white and\nwater-colour the artist ever executed.\n\nTowards the latter end of his life the death of dear relatives and\nfriends cast a sorrowful gloom over him. Amongst the latter Rousseau,\nwho expired in his presence on the 22nd of December 1867, was\nperhaps the loss which seemed to him hardest to bear. A staunch and\ntrusty friend, who was to be relied upon when his prospects seemed the\nmost hopeless, he had been one of the very few who had appreciated\nMillet's talents at their full worth, and who, moreover, scanty as his\nown means were, was ever ready to stretch out his hand to assist his\nstruggling friend.\n\nShortly afterwards Millet paid a visit to his patron, Herr Hartmann,\nat M\u00fcnster, and from here he went for a short time into Switzerland.\n\nUpon his return he devoted himself with great earnestness to work, and\nachieved a certain success at the Salons with his exhibits. The\noutbreak of the war with Germany caused him to migrate with his family\nto Cherbourg, where he thought he might continue to work, removed as\nfar as possible from the scenes of carnage and struggle which were\ngoing on farther east. Transported once more amongst the scenes of his\nchildhood, he felt an increased impetus to production, and when he\nreturned to Barbizon late in 1871, he brought with him a number of\ncanvases of the highest quality; conspicuous amongst them was the\nwonderful \"Gr\u00e9ville Church,\" now in the Louvre.\n\nThe anxieties of his troublous life were, however, beginning to show\ntheir effect upon his constitution; a persistent cough developed, and\nalthough an amelioration would occasionally occur, it was always\nsucceeded by a worse condition than before. His health suffered a\ngeneral decline, and he finally breathed his last on the 20th of\nJanuary 1875. He was buried in the little cemetery of Chailly, beside\nhis friend Rousseau, amidst the scenery they both loved so well.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE MAN AND HIS ART\n\n\nMillet is an instance of an artist working out his own destiny,\nimpelled by irresistible genius, in the teeth of seemingly\ninsurmountable obstacles. He started life with enormous disadvantages;\nwithout friends in influential circles to spread his fame or plead his\ncause; without money to enable him to outlive and triumph over the\nignorant fanaticism of critics and artists, so soaked in the\nconventionalised art of their time that they had not perception enough\nto appreciate the full meaning of that naturalistic movement, which\nwas finally to sweep away the quasi-classic art they boasted of with\nsuch bombastic effusion. The path was hard and thorny, and his triumph\nwas not finally consummated until after his death. He himself found\nhis only satisfaction in the fact that he had lived his life according\nto the dictates of his genius, and had achieved the maximum of which\nhe was capable.\n\nMillet and our own Cotman were somewhat kindred spirits; there is much\nmore affinity between the work of the two men than is apparent to any\none who has not closely studied them. The marvellous \"Breaking the\nClod,\" now happily permanently housed at the British Museum, betrays\nthe same tremendous conception and broad outlook which characterises\nmany a drawing of Millet's. Both highly strung to a painful extent,\nthey were each conscious of their inability to curb the power which\nprescribed a certain course for them, and in spite of pecuniary\ndifficulties and unpopularity, an inevitable result of their intense\noriginality, they pursued a steady course to the end of their lives.\n\nThe socialistic doctrines which have been read into the work of Millet\nare rather the outcome of the world's uneasy conscience being brought\nface to face with a crushing indictment of existing conditions, than\nof any design on the artist's part to further the cause of a political\npropaganda by means of his art. This somewhat extravagant reading into\nhis art has certainly been carried to excess. Particularly has such\nbeen the case in America, where a large number of his finest works are\nat present to be found, curiously enough in the hands of enormously\nwealthy people, who are frequently perhaps the least able to\nunderstand the real meaning of his message.\n\nComing from a peasant stock, his sympathies were always with the\npeasant; it was the only class he understood or cared for. He lived as\none of them, and shared to a large extent in their labour. He has been\ndesignated, not inappropriately, the philosopher in sabots. Rightly or\nwrongly he has come to be looked upon as one of the high priests of\ncommunistic doctrines. Few pictures have been so anathematised as the\n\"Man with the Hoe,\" and perhaps none have done more to inculcate\nsympathy with the degradation of the lower orders of the human race.\n\nThe revolting brutality and vacancy of that face haunts the\nimagination. Is it possible that fellow-creatures so utterly debased\nby toil and neglect exist? Millet dispels any doubt upon the question\nby bequeathing to humanity this trenchant portrait. By no means\nlimited to Barbizon or France, these poor creatures exist in every\ncountry, and curiously enough are considered an essential element in\neach country's development.\n\nThis poignantly human note is observable in almost every work Millet\nwrought; his passionate sympathy with his fellow-man is the keynote of\nhis art. The wood-cutter in his arduous toil, the shepherd in his\nsolitariness, the labourer turning the soil with unvarying and\nlaborious monotony, the mother caring for her children--all carry the\nsame message for him of that strange and incomprehensible mingling of\njoy and sadness we call life. Like many great minds before and since\nhis time, our artist found the greatest joy in life in a placid and\nnever changing melancholy. But the peasants he chose knew nothing of\nthe sadness he saw in them. Completely inured to their toil, and\nsubdued by it, with no refining or uplifting influence to stimulate\nthem, they knew nothing, aspired to nothing beyond what they were; it\nwas left to Millet to supply the \"might have been.\" He saw the inky\nblackness of the mind of the \"Man with the Hoe,\" the pathetic\ninequality between the mounted farmer directing the safe storage of\nhis crop, and the stooping figures of the \"Gleaners\" eager to scrape\nup the miserable crumbs which had fallen from the rich man's table. He\ntraced the lives of these simple folk until we arrive at the grim and\ngaunt figure of Death, who, as he grasps the woodman by the shoulder,\nreminds him that his course is finished and that he, in common with\nall his fellow-men, must enter the great unknown land from which there\nis no return. It is a sad and melancholy art, vibrating with purity\nand truth, the outpouring of a great soul yearning to express itself\nto the utmost of its power. The mind and character of the man can be\nread in every line and in every touch of the brush. His drawings and\netchings are even more searching in their virility than his pictures.\n\nThere is a spontaneousness about them we search for in vain in his\nwork in oil and pastel. In black and white his intensely emotional\nmind found a swift method of expression; in the laboriousness of oil\npainting he was fettered with the complications of the medium. It can\nbe fairly said that only in one or two paintings--a notable example\ncan be cited in the wondrous \"Sawyers\" at South Kensington--does he\nrise to the height of a great painter. Millet was a poet, a\nphilosopher, a great thinker, and the means he chose for expressing\nhimself were those which were best fitted to his purpose. His\npredilections in art were concentrated upon the greatest, and\nconsequently the men who appealed to him were the thinkers of the\nages. Mantegna and Correggio, Michel Angelo and the mighty Greeks,\nthese were the masters who left their impress upon his mind and art.\n\nThe influence of so sincere and profound an artist has necessarily\nbeen profound. He has moulded men who have achieved world-wide fame;\nSegantini, for example, would never have risen to the heights he did\nhad the example of Millet not been ever before him. There have been\nmany who, without possessing his genius, have endeavoured to follow\nin his footsteps, but successfully as his imitators have sometimes\ncaught his style, their productions can never live alongside his,\nbecause they lack the real ring of sincerity.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n        a. One bed, or folding cot,\n        b. One oil stove,\n        c. One lamp,\n        d. Enough supplies of all kinds sufficient for six months,\n        e. Pots, pans, kettles, etc.\nIt is needless to say that positions in Manila and Iloilo were now at\na premium.\n\nWas it possible that teachers were to be sent to places where even the\nnecessaries of life could not be obtained! Was it possible that many\nwould be sent to places so remote that for six months no fresh\nsupplies could be gotten! A mass meeting was held at once, and a\ncommittee was appointed to send a cablegram to the Associated Press\npetitioning aid from the American people at large. Realizing what\nconsternation would be created throughout the United States by such a\nmessage, two of the teachers leaped into a carriage at the close of\nthe meeting and a few moments later were closeted with the chief\nexecutive of the department. As a result the committee was persuaded\nnot to send the cablegram to the Associated Press until by courtesy it\nhad been sent to the President. Of course, this diplomatic move tided\naffairs over and the teachers who had flatly refused to budge from\nManila now agreed to go on to their stations, being assured that\nwhatever action was best would be taken.\n\nThe day had come when we must separate. We were to enter an untried\nand an unknown field. It was fitting that we have a final joyous\nmeeting, so the best orchestra in the archipelago was engaged and we\n\"chased the hours with flying feet\" until dawn so that whatever might\ncome to us in that unknown future upon which we were entering each\nwould hold in pleasant memory our last evening together.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER III. - A DRAMA IN ACTUAL LIFE.\n\n\nAlmost every one heeded the warning to go to his station forearmed\nwith at least necessaries of life, but, as it had never fallen to the\nlot of the writer to cook, he refused to learn at that late day, so he\ntook no pot, no pan, no kettle, putting his future into the hands of\nan uncertain fate and relying upon the unknown hospitality of the\nFilipino.\n\nBacalod, the capital of the province of Occidental Negros, was our\ndestination. The second morning after leaving Manila, we awoke with\nthe \"Kilpatrick\" lying at anchor in a shallow bay. We were several\nmiles from the shore and nothing in sight indicated that we had\nreached a place of any importance. Late the night before we had been\nawakened by the loud, sharp ringing of the ship's bells, accompanied\nby the reversal of the engines and a general disturbance awaking the\ncrew. So our first impressions on coming on deck were that we had run\naground. But the captain assured us that everything was ship-shape and\nthat this was the nearest point of approach to Capiz, a town of\nconsiderable importance on the island of Panay, where a body of troops\nwas to embark for home. Not even the grass hut of a native was in\nsight. Search as we would, not a sign was seen of a stream flowing\ninto the sea, indicating the probable presence of a town. There was\nnot a sign of life of any kind save one lone column of thin, blue\nsmoke that arose from the side of a mountain miles away. One would\nhave thought that we were explorers of three hundred years ago lying\noff the shore of some unknown land.\n\nAfter breakfast the steam launch, together with all the boats, was\nlowered, and several of us who had determined to miss no opportunity\nto gather information about the islands took our places in the launch\nby the side of the ship's mate, and steamed away across the water with\na long line of boats strung out in the rear. We headed away toward a\ngroup of cocoanut trees, and about an hour later stepped ashore on a\npile of decayed coral rocks that extended some twenty or thirty feet\nout into the water, thus forming the only landing place of a town of\nseveral thousands of people and of considerable commercial importance.\n\nA few moments after we had landed, an army wagon drawn by a\nmagnificent pair of mules came up out of a tropical jungle along a\nnarrow road. We clambered into the wagon and were soon lost in the\ndepths of foliage from which we had just seen the vehicle emerge.\n\nLong waving bamboos with their plumy leafage hung over the road from\neach side, meeting and overlapping in the center until they formed an\narchway so dense that the tropical sun now high in the heavens\npenetrated it only at intervals. At times the wagon sank up to the\nhubs in the soft earth, and the muscles of the mules stood out like\nwhip-cords under the skin as they drew us forward.\n\nAt a sharp turn in the road we came upon the first division of troops\nthat was to embark for home. The look of joy upon their sun-browned\nfaces was inexpressible. Their work was done, and with elastic step\nand smiling faces they saluted us as they passed by. The reign of\nforce was at an end; it was going out with them; the reign of peace\nhad begun; it was coming in with us.\n\nIn the afternoon when we returned from the town the last of the troops\nhad arrived and, as we drove up, the bugle was sounding the call to\nsupper. We noticed native women mingling with the troops and, indeed,\na native woman was in constant attention waiting upon one of the\nsoldiers with whom we ate. Her clothes were clean, her hair was nicely\ncombed, and her general appearance was neat. She seemed to anticipate\nthe slightest wish of the soldier with whom she was. She brought him\nwater to drink, cleaned his plate after the meal and saw that his\nknife, fork, and spoon were put into his haversack.\n\nWe had now finished supper and the launch had returned for the last\nload of troops. The lieutenant in command of the company gave the\norder to \"fall in\"; the men shouldered their rifles and fell into\nline. \"Forward, march!\" called the lieutenant, and the column swept\nforward towards the boats. The women had until now restrained\nthemselves, but, as their husbands marched away never to return, their\nfeelings could no longer be restrained. One young woman of about\neighteen, who was leaning against a rock by the roadside sobbing, when\nher husband passed, leaped up in frenzy of passionate love and caught\nthe rifle from his shoulder. Her first impulse seemed to be to throw\nthe gun away, but suddenly realizing the futility of such an act she\nburst into tears, shouldered the rifle herself and marched on by his\nside. Another woman of more mature age threw her arms around the legs\nof a tall stalwart man, and drew him bodily from the line.\n\nBut the troops marched on and entered the boats. One woman who had\nbeen unnoticed before came down into the shallow water and caught hold\nof our last boat as if to prevent its leaving, while others stood\nmingling their sobs with the sounds of the wavelets as they broke on\nthe sands. As we passed away, an expectant mother, standing in bold\noutline against the twilight sky, threw up her hands in an agony of\ndespair and then sank upon the stones. The curtain had fallen upon a\ndrama in actual life deeper in pathos than any other we had ever seen\nor ever expected to see. Depth of passion, depth of love! Who can\nfathom the human heart?\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. - WHAT THE TEACHERS DID.\n\n\nThere is a remarkable sameness about the towns in the Philippines.\n\nThey all have a large open square about the middle of the town, around\nthree sides of which are Chinese stores, unless one side lies open to\nthe sea, and on the fourth is the great stone ecclesia. The streets\nrun at right angles to one another and divide up the town into\ncreditable squares.\n\nEverybody in the Philippines lives up-stairs, for the ground is so\nsoaked with water during the rainy season that it is a menace to\nhealth to live upon the ground floor. So even the poorest nippa hut\nis built upon stakes four or five feet above the ground.\n\nBacalod is a typical Philippine town. As we landed, a broad open\nsquare was spread out before us. Two sides of the square were lined\nwith two-story houses in which were Chinese stores below and Filipino\nhomes above. On the third side stood the great stone church in whose\nmassive tower the clock was striking the hour of four, while the\nfourth lay open to the sea that had borne us thither.\n\nWe landed, but it was in a method new to us and one not usually\nemployed by the traveling public.\n\nWhen our sail boat ran aground on the sandy bottom a hundred yards or\nmore from the shore, a crowd of Filipino men who were on the beach\nslowly rolled up their pantaloons and waded out to the rescue,--for\nthe money that was in it. The boat's crew elevated their trousers'\nlegs also and slided down into the water. Each of us then straddled\nthe neck of a Filipino standing in the water and was held by ankles to\nbe steadied while our biped mounts proceeded to the shore.\n\nWe were now on the ground and face to face with the situation. To give\nthe reader an idea of the actual conditions met by the first teachers\nwho went to the Islands, the following is copied from the instructions\ngiven us in Manila:\n    1. There shall be two sessions daily of all schools, and the\n    last hour of the morning session shall be devoted solely to\n    instructing the Filipino teachers.\n\n    2. In cases where teachers are sent to a town in which there\n    is no school-house, they are expected to secure the aid of the\n    people and have one built.\n\n    3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is\n    stopped.\n\n    4. All supplies must be kept under lock and key. In towns\n    where there is no case or box to lock the supplies in, and it\n    is also impossible to get the town council to furnish a case,\n    a requisition may be sent to Manila, and, if an appropriation\n    can be secured, one will be made and sent out.\n\nThus it can be easily seen that we were indeed pioneers. In many\nplaces no school-house was to be found, and in some cases it was even\ndifficult to get the town council to provide a case in which to keep\nthe supplies.\n\nThe work of the teachers was, in short; to \"make the English language\nthe basis of instruction in the public schools.\" On our arrival at\nBacalod two schools were found in progress, for some soldiers had been\ndetailed for the work here previous to our coming. One of these was\nfor boys and the other, for girls. Thus the work here had been in a\nmeasure simplified, but complications that had arisen at Talisay, one\nof the largest and richest towns on the island, demanded a change of\nteachers and the writer was assigned to the place as superintendent.\n\nHere an attempt had been made to start a school but it had failed\nignominiously and a system of education was to be put into operation\nfrom the very start.\n\nThe Filipinos are not strong advocates of co-education, so separate\nschools were to be started for the boys and the girls. The one for the\nboys was gotten well in hand before the one for the girls was\nattempted at all.\n\nA few days after reaching the town and securing a home the\npresidente of the town had it publicly announced that the following\nMonday morning at eight o'clock a public school for boys would be\nopened in a building that had been rented for the purpose by the\nmunicipal council. About the middle of the afternoon of the same day a\nman beat a little drum throughout all the streets of the town to call\nthe people out and the town clerk announced both in Spanish and in the\nnative language that this public school would begin at the time and\nplace mentioned above; that instruction would be free to all who came;\nthat the government would furnish all supplies; and that instruction\nwould be given in the English language. A native principal and\nassistants were employed and everything was ready to begin.\n\nThe official report of the result is as follows:\n    Boys' public school of Talisay, Negros, P. I., began November\n    4, 1901. Forty-three boys present at eight o'clock. Forty-one\n    of them knew \"good morning\" and \"good afternoon\" but do not\n    know the distinction between them. Two of them speak simple\n    Spanish. At eight forty-five, eight more, who had been\n    attending an early morning private school, came in together.\n\n    The books they brought were so varied and so different from\n    one another that it seemed impossible to bring any reasonable\n    degree of order out of such a chaos, and so, after struggling\n    vainly for about a week with the problem, the superintendent\n    by one fell stroke removed everything in use and put in a\n    uniform system, and from that day on the English language has\n    been the basis of instruction in the public schools of\n    Talisay. The work was of necessity very slow at first, but by\n    the end of a year two schools were going nicely and a number\n    of the brightest boys and girls had made really excellent\n    progress.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER V. - A \"BAILE.\"\n\n\nNot long after the arrival of our party at Bacalod we received an\ninvitation to a \"baile\" given in our honor by the inhabitants of\nSilay, a town some ten or twelve miles up the northern coast and one\nnoted for its social life. The invitation was accepted with pleasure,\nand about the middle of the afternoon on the day appointed we were\nclad in the immaculate white of the tropics and steaming away up the\ncoast on board a launch sent for our conveyance. Twilight was still\nlingering on the path of day when we anchored just off shore at the\ntown. A row-boat containing the officials of the city came out to meet\nus and, in due season, we were ushered into a spacious drawing-room\nfilled almost to overflowing with the \u00e9lite of the town. The \u00e9lite of\ntowns in the Philippines speak Spanish, and, as only one or two of our\nparty could at that time boast of more than a formal acquaintance with\nthe Castilian tongue, the exchange of ideas that evening between us\nand the Filipinos was of necessity not very rapid.\n\nThe necessity of easy communication between us was rendered somewhat\nless indispensable by the announcement of supper as soon as we were\nrested from our trip. When we had taken our places at the table a\nyoung Filipino about twenty-five years of age arose and gave a lengthy\ntoast to the recent union of the Philippines with the United States.\n\nBut as we Americans were unable to scale the dizzy heights of his\nclimaxes or sink to the depths of his pathos, we forewent the\npleasures of his oratory and turned our attention to the savory odor\nof lamb, chicken, and roast pig that came slyly stealing up our\nnostrils to send us nerve dispatches about the gastronomic delights of\nour not far distant future.\n\nAt last the toast was ended and the world-wide soup ushered in a long\ntrain of things good to eat, served in a style better fitted to the\ndelights of the appetite than to the formalities of dinners, for, as\nsoon as the pleasant task of one dish was completed by any one, the\nnext was served him at once regardless of the progress made by the\nothers at the table.\n\nThe last course was dulce. The new-comers to the Philippines will\nnot be long in making the acquaintance of this dish, and at all\nmeetings, both public and private, where eatables are served, it\nperforms an important part. It is anything sweet, and it may vary all\nthe way from an india-rubber-like black mixture of cocoanut milk and\ndirty sugar to a really toothsome and respectable confection. No\nmatter of what materials a dish is composed, just so long as it is\nsweet, it is dulce.\n\nAfter paying our respects to this last course, we arose from the table\nand entered a great rectangular room from the center of whose ceiling\nhung a large glass chandelier, a mass of shimmering crystals. In the\nchairs around the room were the wealth, the youth, and the beauty of\nthe town.\n\nThe first and also the last number of every Filipino dance of any\nformality is the \"rigodon.\" The dancers are arranged in a square, or\nquadrangle according to the number participating, and are then led\nthrough a tangled maze of figures that so utterly bewilders the novice\nthat he sinks into his chair at the end of the dance wondering how it\nall came to pass.\n\nWe Americans breathed a sigh of relief when the \"rigodon\" ended, and\nmustered fresh courage for social conquests in the waltz that was now\nbreathing forth from the trembling strings. My companion in the first\ndance had been the young lady by whose side I had sat at dinner. But\nit now became necessary to search for another, so I prudently waited\nto see how partners were chosen, and made no mistake when a few\nmoments later I faced one of the most luscious looking se\u00f1oritas on\nthe opposite side of the room and offered her my arm. My eyes must\nhave told the story that my lips could not utter in Spanish, for she\nsmiled upon me sweetly, arose, and put her hand upon my shoulder. My\narm encircled her waist and I began to waltz. Unfortunately my\ncompanion did not follow, but began to hop up and down in a manner\nmost distressing. Supposing the attack to be only temporary, I paused\nand, much to my relief, she soon showed signs of recovery; and in the\ncourse of time she came to a standstill looking up into my face in an\ninquiring sort of way, apparently wondering why St. Vitus had not paid\nhis respects to me also. A second attempt to follow the music met with\nresults similar to the first, and during the third attempt, which\nseemed to be trembling on the verge of a failure, St. Vitus let go my\ncompanion and seized me with such vigor that she, who was small even\nfor a Filipino, was gathered up bodily and taken around the room at\nsuch a pace that her toes touched the floor only at far distant\nintervals.\n\nAt this point my devotion to the shrine of Terpsichore ceased from\nforce of circumstances and I seated myself in one of the most\ncomfortable chairs in sight that I might carry out a previously formed\nplan to study the Filipino somewhat critically as he appears in\nsociety.\n\nThe first thing that impressed me as the dancers passed up and down\nthe room was the flash of diamonds. Nearly every woman in the room had\non a brooch that flashed the colors of the rainbow at every turn.\n\nAlmost all of them wore one or more rings that showed up brilliantly\nunder the chandelier. Many of the men too, especially the young men,\nwore gems that appeared to be exquisite. A closer inspection showed\nthat some of the gems had flaws and others were of a poor color, but\nno one would have denied that, taken as a whole, it was a really\nbeautiful display.\n\nThe dress of the ladies was richly colored. Many of their skirts were\nof silk covered with hand embroidered flowers, and their filmy pina\nwaists and broad collar pieces were rich with needle-work. They all\nwore a kind of heelless velvet slipper, very common as a dress shoe in\nthe Philippines, or high-heeled patent leather shoes with neatly\nfitting black stockings.\n\nThe men were dressed in white coats and white pantaloons or black\ncoats and white pantaloons. White shirts and collars, together with\nall sorts and styles of cravats and low-cut patent leather shoes with\nhighly colored socks completed their dress.\n\nIt was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money;\nthat they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a\ntable loaded with good things was a fact to which all of us were\nenthusiastic witnesses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VI. - A SKETCH OF LIFE IN THE PHILIPPINES.\n\n\nHouse-keeping in the Philippines presents some interesting phases. Our\nclub of American officials decided to run a mess, so we employed a\ncook and a house boy, then each of us provided himself with a personal\nservant, making a total of six servants for four men--it takes about\nthis proportion of servants to live in any sort of comfort in the\nPhilippines--and launched ourselves boldly upon the sea of domestic\neconomy. But there were shoals ahead of us, for the question of\nregulating servants is one of no small importance in the Philippines,\nand one of its most disadvantageous features is the long chain of\ndependents that usually attends it.\n\nWe gave the cooks so much a day with which to buy supplies in the\nlocal market, for our own table, making him render a daily list of\nexpenditures, and a fixed amount besides to purchase rice and fish for\nhimself and the other servants. Of course, if they wished to vary\ntheir diet and get chicken and fresh pork, which could be had at far\ndistant intervals, it was wholly a matter of their option, but the\nallowance was made on the basis of so much rice and fish a day for\neach. This allowance was about fifteen cents a day in Spanish coin per\nservant.\n\nThus far all was well. We had agreed to give the cook eight dollars a\nmonth in Spanish money, thinking that good wages would procure good\nservice, but the visions of affluence that floated before him on such\nfloods of wealth were so alluring that they drew him from the kitchen\nto the cooler veranda. In less than a week he had employed an\nassistant at four dollars a month; in less than another week that\nassistant had employed him an assistant at two dollars a month; in\nless than another week that assistant to the assistant had employed\nhim an assistant at the princely salary of fifty cents a month; and\nfrom fear that the chain of dependents would end only by our having\nthe whole Filipino race attached to our culinary force, we broke up\nhouse-keeping and went boarding again, choosing that as the less of\nthe two evils.\n\nOur house furnishings were almost wholly Philippine. The table ware\nand the food on the table came from the ends of the earth. The knives\nand forks were made in Germany, the plates were manufactured in\nEngland, the glass ware and table cloth, in the United States. The\noatmeal and flour came from the United States also. The butter came\nfrom Australia, the rice from China, the salt from Russia, and the\nother eatables from sources about as various as their separate names.\n\nSwitzerland furnished the condensed milk and Illinois the canned\ncream. Nearly all of the canned fruit bore labels from Spain.\n\nThus it can easily be seen that life in the Philippines, if lived\naccording to American ideals, is dependent upon a highly developed and\nhighly complex commerce. However, the difficulties of transportation\nand the restriction of large stocks of merchandise to Manila and some\nhalf a dozen other towns, make so great a difference between country\nlife and city life that a short comparison of the two will not be out\nof place, and life in Manila may well be taken as being fairly typical\nof the latter.\n\nLife in Manila is pleasant, but expensive. It is pleasant from the\nfact that it is not only the capital but also metropolis of the\narchipelago. Thus the combination of wealth and high official position\nhas given to Manila a society of the highest and most refined type.\n\nThe process of beautifying and improving the city which is constantly\ngoing on bids fair to give us at no distant day a city of which we may\nwell be proud.\n\nBut let him who intends living well in Manila on a small income bid\nfarewell at once to so idylic a dream, for it costs much to live well\nthere. In the city of Manila one can get almost anything he wishes,\nbut it must be paid for at the price it commands. Especially in the\ncase of eatables, this price is by no means small, because to the\nfirst cost of articles must in most cases be added the expense of\ndistant shipment from American, European, or Australian ports, and not\ninfrequently the cost of long refrigeration must also be taken into\nconsideration. But, expensive though it is, it is very pleasant to\nlive there and those who have once enjoyed it often wish again to\nquaff the cup of its delights.\n\nIn strong contrast to this pleasant life is the life of the quiet\nlittle hamlet away in the distant islands. Indeed, the Filipino from\nthe distant town, who by some good fortune has been to Manila, or, by\na coup de main, has studied in one of the Manila colleges, is looked\nup to in a true hero-worshiping attitude by all who either know him or\nhear of his fame. Life in such a place is one long state of harmless\ninactivity. Not a wave of trouble from the great outer world ever\ndisturbs its peaceful repose. One lounges forever in an air of\nindolent ease and extreme aversion to anything approaching what might\nbe called a respectable effort.\n\nOne arises in the morning about the time the sun's first rays silver\nthe top leaves of the cocoanut trees and then stirs around until nine\nor ten o'clock, when it is found expedient to avoid a further exposure\nto the sun. From then until about five o'clock in the afternoon it is\nbest to take things as they come, even though one of those things be a\nFilipino dinner. But then you may have your vehiclo attached to a\nyoung bull with a ring in his nose and go for a drive. If it is the\ndry season you will probably enjoy the drive unless you object to the\nfrequent clouds of dust swept along by the evening wind. If it is in\nthe rainy season your pleasure will depend to a considerable extent\nupon how wet you get; but, whether the season be wet or dry, your\npleasure will be regulated largely by the state of harmony existing\nbetween the driver and the bull.\n\nIn these quiet secluded nooks successive generations of Filipinos are\nborn, reared, grow old and die in an even chain of events broken only\nby the occasional erection of a new grass house on the identical spot\nwhere its predecessors have stood for ages. The son lives in the house\nof his father, cultivates the same few square feet of soil planted in\nedible roots, climbs the same cocoanut trees, follows the same winding\npath down to the stream, pounds rice in the same mortar and with the\nsame stick that his ancestors have used from time unremembered, and,\nin case of illness, curls up on a grass mat in a corner of the room\nuntil he dies or by some good fortune recovers. Beyond this narrow\nhorizon he never looks. So narrow and contracted is the life that the\nlanguages of two towns a few miles apart are so different that one\nwould scarcely recognize them as belonging to the same race of people.\n\nSuch are the two extremes of life in our new far Eastern provinces:\nthe one is active, progressive, and cosmopolitan; the other, inactive,\ndecadent, and narrow; but, whether one enjoys the first or endures the\nsecond, there comes to him after leaving a longing to lounge again in\ntropic airs and listen to the lullaby of the winds among the palms.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VII. - THE FILIPINO AT HOME.\n\n\nAs one enters a Filipino sitting-room for the first time, there is one\nfeature in the arrangement of the furniture that impresses itself upon\nhim at once, and it may be stated without fear of serious\ncontradiction that this same peculiar feature in its arrangement will\ncontinue to face him, as he enters different homes, about as certainly\nas he crosses the threshold.\n\nThe arrangement referred to is that of one large mirror, one settee,\nand some ten or a dozen chairs that appear to have had a certain\norderly affection for one another. The mirror is hung upon one of the\nlarge interior parts of the house about four feet above the floor. The\nwooden houses in the Philippines are built by setting large posts\nupright into the ground, extending into the air from twenty to thirty\nfeet. Cross timbers are fastened to these upright posts about eight or\nten feet above the ground and then not sawed off even with the posts,\nbut allowed to extend beyond them each way. The framework of the house\nis built upon these extending cross timbers, a style of building by\nwhich these large upright posts are left standing out on the inside of\nthe room from one to three feet from the walls. It is on that one of\nthese posts most nearly opposite the door that the mirror always finds\nits place. Immediately beneath the mirror is the settee; and the\nchairs are arranged in two parallel lines facing one another and at\nright angles with the ends of the settee. However odd this arrangement\nmay appear to one when he first enters a Filipino drawing-room, there\nare two things to be said in its favor. In the first place, it places\nyou face to face with the person with whom you are conversing so that\nyou can watch him,--a matter of no small moment in the Philippines. In\nthe next place, it enables you to give one of the young ladies a\nsheep's-eye in the mirror while the others present are left where\nMoses was in our much abused conundrum.\n\nThe size of the residence and the quality of its furnishings depends\nupon the wealth of the owner. But there is so vast a difference\nbetween the mode of life of the highest class and the tao, or lowest\nclass, that it is well to speak of them separately, and the great\nmiddle class of Filipinos can easily be imagined to occupy the\nintervening ground.\n\nThe rich Filipino's house is usually of wood built upon a wall of\nstone or brick from ten to fifteen feet high. The floors are kept\nhighly polished in his hallway, dressing-room, and bed-rooms. There\nare, of course, no fire-places in any of the rooms, but on some\noccasions something is needed to dry the rain-soaked atmosphere, for\neven in the dry season it has been seen to rain for five successive\ndays and nights without the cessation of a moment.\n\nA long chain of dependents is attached to the household of the rich\nFilipino. The master has his special body servant to be present at all\ntimes to do his master's bidding, in short, to be the visible\nmechanism of his master's volition. So, too, the lady of the house has\nher servant woman to do the slightest bidding of her ladyship. Then\nthere is the cook who is almost invariably a man, a house boy or two,\nand the coachman. These functionaries, with their assistants and\nassistants to the assistants, together with a servant or two for the\nexclusive service of the children, complete the economic household.\n\nSuch a family has an abundance of rice and wheat bread, also of\nchicken and fish with occasional fresh beef. They have also a good\ndeal of dulce. They regularly serve wine and frequently serve beer\non their tables.\n\nIn strong contrast with this mode of life is that of the tao. His\ndiet consists almost wholly of rice and small uncleaned fish boiled\ntogether. As a rule knife, fork, plate, and spoon find no place in his\nhousehold. The rice and fish are boiled in a pot and then allowed to\ncool in the same vessel or poured out to cool in a large earthen or\nwooden bowl. Then Mr. Tao together with Mrs. Tao and all the young\nTaos squat on their heels around the mixture and satisfy that\nintangible thing called the appetite. They do not use chop sticks as\nthe Chinese do, but the rice and fish are caught in a hollow formed by\nthe first three fingers of the right hand. The thumb is then placed\nbehind the mass. It is raised up and poised before the mouth, with a\nskill coming from the evolution of ages, when a contraction of the\nmuscles of the thumb throws the mass into the mouth with a skill that\nis marvelous to any but a Filipino. To judge from the most reliable\ninformation, the poorest class do not have an abundance of food,\nalthough it would seem that such a condition of things would be\nwell-nigh impossible. However, in a census of one hundred school\nchildren there were found six boys and four girls who declared that\nthey had never had enough to eat, and the native teacher stated that\nthis was probably true.\n\nThe wide gulf between the tao and the rich man is filled by the\ngreat middle class of Filipinos.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VIII. - VISIT TO A LEPER COLONY.\n\n\nNot far from our town was a leper colony and the first Saturday that\ncould be spared was set aside for a trip to the place. It happened\nthat none of the other Americans were at leisure on this particular\nmorning, but, rather then delay the trip or miss it altogether, the\nwriter, armed with a revolver, started out alone.\n\nThe road had been described so accurately by one who was supposed to\nknow it that it was deemed well-nigh impossible to miss the way. The\nmain highway was followed to the point where the by-path supposed to\nlead to the settlement turned off through some bamboo thickets and a\nlow tropical wood. This path led straight away towards the sea-coast\nwhere the houses of the colony were said to stand in a cocoanut grove\nby the beach.\n\nUpon arriving at the settlement, a very inhospitable reception was\nreceived from a mangy cur that growled and showed a very uninviting\nset of sharp, white teeth behind his snarling lips. The growling of\nthe dog had attracted the attention of an old man who, with age-bent\nback, was pounding rice in a mortar about fifty yards away. He turned\nslowly around and, upon seeing an intruder into the primitive quiet of\nthe place, gave a sharp, far-reaching call. The sound had scarcely\nrung through the grove when from about a dozen of the little grass\nhouses dotted here and there fifteen or twenty men armed with bolos\ncame out and gathered around the old man. A sense of my danger flashed\nupon me. Three miles from town and alone in a tropical jungle, I could\nbe almost instantly overcome by this band of bolo-men, and the only\nreport that would ever reach my people would be that I had\n\"disappeared.\" Of course, attack was by no means certain, but the\npotentiality of the situation was thrilling. A drawn revolver and the\ngleaming of its shining barrel had the effect of stopping the men, who\nseemed to be hesitating as to a course of action, until a somewhat\ndignified retreat was made to an open space in the rear from where a\nless dignified and a more hasty retreat began which did not stop short\nof Bacalod.\n\nEnough had been seen, however, even in this short visit, to give\nconvincing proof that the settlement visited was no colony of lepers;\nso, that afternoon two servant boys being taken as guides and\ninterpreters, another attempt was made to reach the goal desired.\n\nThis attempt was successful, and, after about two hours of walking, a\nlittle cluster of grass huts snugly hidden by the sea-coast came into\nview. As we approached, one would have thought it a gala-day. Some few\nchildren, apparently from six to thirteen years of age, almost wholly\nnude, were romping and playing in the open space around which the huts\nstood, and no one would ever have thought that any cloud so horrible\nas leprosy could hover over a place apparently so happy.\n\nBy the side of the path as we passed was a man and his wife setting\nout potato plants. His hands were so puffed and his fingers so short\nthat he could scarcely use them, but he was working along as best he\ncould. His wife's feet were so swollen and twisted that she walked\nonly with the greatest difficulty. We passed them by and entered the\nopen space above referred to.\n\nThe children now saw us, and those of them who could darted away like\nfrightened rabbits, each to his own burrow. An old man who was sitting\nin the warm afternoon sun on the little bamboo platform before his hut\nwas aroused from his lethargic repose by the scampering away of the\nchildren. He arose, trembling upon his tottering limbs, all drawn and\ntwisted, and hobbled away into his hut.\n\nThe children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at\nthe doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of\nthe settlement. In a few moments we were surrounded by a circle of\nhuman beings at once so repulsive and so pitiable that its graphic\nvividness can never be accurately portrayed.\n\nThe old man referred to above, having put on a pair of snow-white\npantaloons, appeared now at the doorway of his hut, followed a few\nmoments later by his wife who had evidently clothed herself in the\nbest raiment she had. At a call from the old man, all the men, women,\nand children in the settlement came out of their huts and stood in a\nline before us. The old man was spokesman and in his native visayan\ntongue made a heart-rending appeal for aid which we were powerless to\ngive. Attention was called to a leper woman, apparently about\ntwenty-five years of age, whose face had been attacked by the disease\nand whose appearance was truly pathetic. Upon her hip was a child\nabout a year and a half old and, strange to say, the child showed as\nyet no signs whatever of the disease.\n\nWhat an indissoluble enigma is life! Here in a little cluster of grass\nhuts in a secluded nook of a secluded island of an all but secluded\narchipelago was gathered together a little community of wretched\nnatives, driven by their loathsomeness from association with others\neven of the same half-savage race. Yet here, men and women loved and\nwere married, by mutual trust if not by law, and children were born of\nthe union to live forever under the unspeakable horror that\novershadowed the unfortunate parents. Love, hatred, sorrow, and\njoy--every passion that enters into the complex structure of the human\nheart even here, in this scene of sadness and despair, was playing\napparently as freely as where misfortune and disease had never crossed\nthe portals of life.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER IX. - A \"HIKE.\"\n\n\nWe were lounging lazily in our hammocks at Jimamaylan one evening in\nApril. Supper was just ended, and the soldiers in the post were\ncollected in groups here and there spinning yarns to pass away the\ntime, when a Filipino clad only in a loin cloth came down the street\nat a steadily swinging run and stopped in front of the sentry. He\nbrought the announcement that a band of ladrones had just burned a\nsugar mill and were advancing to sack a barrio about fifteen miles\naway.\n\nThe invitation of the commanding officer to go on a \"hike\" was eagerly\naccepted, and, in ten minutes after the message was given, the troops\nwere on the march followed by two adventurous pedagogues.\n\nDarkness was just closing in as we left the town, but a resplendent\ntropic moon soon made the night almost as brilliant as the day. The\ntrail we followed led over rough and rocky country. Sometimes for a\ndistance of a mile or more we passed over barren wastes of volcanic\nslag poured out in anger by some peak whose convulsions have long\nsince ceased. Again we would descend into a tropical jungle from the\ndense foliage of which the ladrones could have leaped at any moment,\nhad they known of our coming, and annihilated our little band. We\nforded rapid streams with the water at our breasts, and halted only\nonce in that rapid march of fifteen miles.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the town we met a man who was standing\nguard against a surprise by the ladrones. Nothing could well have been\nmuch more grotesque and nothing could much better illustrate the\nabsolutely primitive condition of the Filipinos in the interior of the\nislands than the appearance of this guard. A pair of knee pants, a\nconical grass hat, and a hemp shirt formed his entire apparel. A long\nflat wooden shield, a bolo, and a long bamboo spear with a sharp,\nflat, iron point, completed his equipment for battle.\n\nHere stood the first and the twentieth centuries side by side. The\nFilipino who had advanced only a stage beyond the condition of\nprimitive man with his knife, spear, and wooden shield, stood side by\nside with the American soldier, a representative of modern life with\nhis magazine rifle, his canteen, his knapsack,--with every article of\nhis clothing made to give him the highest possible efficiency as the\nunit of a military organization.\n\nA few yards farther on we met another guard equipped similarly to the\nfirst. Upon reaching the town, news had just been received that a\ndetachment of troops from another post had intercepted the ladrones\nand fought a skirmish with them. The ladrones had escaped and we set\nout in pursuit of them on a chase wilder than a Quixotic dream. We\nwound our way into the mountains behind the town, inquiring at every\ngrass hut we passed whether the band of ladrones had passed that way,\nbut only once was even a trace of them found. Then it was learned that\nat a certain place they had separated into groups of three or four and\ngone glimmering through the dream of things that were. This place was\nin a secluded nook of the mountains where in years gone by some\nadventurous Spaniard had erected a primitive water mill to grind his\nsugar-cane. We had now marched about twenty miles and the feet of the\npedagogues were a mass of blisters. They had reached the point where\nthat form of military maneuvering called \"hiking\" ceased to possess\nany alluring charms. So a native was persuaded to come out of his lone\nmountain hut and hitch up his carabao and cart. He was then made to\nget on the carabao's back, while the aforesaid pedagogues lay down on\nthe sugar-cane pulp that had been put into the body of the cart, and\nthe driver was instructed to start for the post we had left hours\nbefore, and not to stop until he got there. Being uncertain but that\nsome of the ladrones would learn of our having left the body of troops\nand would try the metal of our steel, we at first agreed that neither\nof us should go to sleep, but it was later decided that probably the\ndriver had no greater desire to cross the Styx than his passengers had\nand that in case of danger he would awaken us, so both took a revolver\nin each hand, stretched out supinely and went to sleep.\n\nSuch a sleep! The rough jolting of the cart over an almost impassable\nroad was never enough to break the spell of slumber. When we awoke the\nblazing tropic sun was past the midday mark of morning, shining full\ninto our unprotected and well-nigh blistered faces.\n\nA pack of dogs were heralding our approach to a little village at the\nfoot of the mountains where ponies were procured to take us back to\nthe post."

                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently\nno time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth dimension of Space\nas a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house\nbecame quite quiet.\n\nOn reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up\nagainst a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realize\nhis position. Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\nhundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the\nDowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone\ninto hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains on\none of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who\nhad been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr\nto nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair\nby the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six\nweeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become\nreconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that\nnotorious sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible\nnight when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his\ndressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and\nconfessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox\nout of \u00a350,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card, and swore that\nthe ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back\nto him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because\nhe had seen a green hand tapping at the window-pane, to the beautiful\nLady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round\nher throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin,\nand who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of the\nKing's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he went\nover his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as\nhe recalled to mind his last appearance as \"Red Reuben, or the Strangled\nBabe,\" his d\u00e9but as \"Guant Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,\"\n\nand the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely\nplaying ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And\nafter all this some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him\nthe Rising Sun Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite\nunbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever been treated in this\nmanner. Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance, and remained till\ndaylight in an attitude of deep thought.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III\n\n\nThe next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed\nthe ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. \"I have\nno wish,\" he said, \"to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say\nthat, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,\"--a very just remark,\nat which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.\n\n\"Upon the other hand,\" he continued, \"if he really declines to use the\nRising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him. It\nwould be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside\nthe bedrooms.\"\n\nFor the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the\nblood-stain on the library floor. This certainly was very strange, as\nthe door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept\nclosely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a\ngood deal of comment. Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red,\nthen it would be vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came\ndown for family prayers, according to the simple rites of the Free\nAmerican Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright\nemerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party\nvery much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening. The\nonly person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia, who,\nfor some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the\nsight of the blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was\nemerald-green.\n\nThe second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in\nthe hall. Rushing down-stairs, they found that a large suit of old\narmour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone\nfloor, while seated in a high-backed chair was the Canterville ghost,\nrubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face. The\ntwins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged\ntwo pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained\nby long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United\nStates Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in\naccordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost\nstarted up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a\nmist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so\nleaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase\nhe recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of\ndemoniac laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely\nuseful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single\nnight, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French\ngovernesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly\nlaughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and\nrang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door\nopened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown. \"I am\nafraid you are far from well,\" she said, \"and have brought you a bottle\nof Doctor Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a\nmost excellent remedy.\" The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at\nonce to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an\naccomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family\ndoctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's\nuncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps,\nhowever, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself\nwith becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep\nchurchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.\n\nOn reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the\nmost violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross\nmaterialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what\nreally distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit\nof mail. He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by\nthe sight of a Spectre in armour, if for no more sensible reason, at\nleast out of respect for their natural poet Longfellow, over whose\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\nhour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides it was his own suit.\n\nHe had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament, and had\nbeen highly complimented on it by no less a person than the Virgin Queen\nherself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely overpowered\nby the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen\nheavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees severely, and\nbruising the knuckles of his right hand.\n\nFor some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of\nhis room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.\n\nHowever, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to\nmake a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his\nfamily. He selected Friday, August 17th, for his appearance, and spent\nmost of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in\nfavour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet\nfrilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards evening a\nviolent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was\njust such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to\nmake his way quietly to Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the\nfoot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\nof low music. He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville\nblood-stain by means of Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent. Having reduced\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and\nhis wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead,\nwhile he hissed into her trembling husband's ear the awful secrets of\nthe charnel-house. With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made\nup his mind. She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and\ngentle. A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more\nthan sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the\ncounterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins, he was quite\ndetermined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be done was, of\ncourse, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling\nsensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each\nother, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse,\ntill they became paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw off the\nwinding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white, bleached bones and\none rolling eyeball, in the character of \"Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's\nSkeleton,\" a r\u00f4le in which he had on more than one occasion produced a\ngreat effect, and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of\n\"Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.\"\n\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the\nlight-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves\nbefore they retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still,\nand, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the\nwindow-panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family\nslept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\ncould hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States. He\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his\nmurdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like\nan evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.\n\nOnce he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only\nthe baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange\nsixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\nin the midnight air. Finally he reached the corner of the passage that\nled to luckless Washington's room. For a moment he paused there, the\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's\nshroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was\ncome. He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had\nhe done so than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid\nhis blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was\nstanding a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous\nas a madman's dream! Its head was bald and burnished; its face round,\nand fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\nfeatures into an eternal grin. From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\nlight, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like\nto his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form. On its breast\nwas a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of\nshame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime,\nand, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\n\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's\njack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler. Once in the\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small\npallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes. After a time, however,\nthe brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to\ngo and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight. Accordingly,\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling\nthat, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid\nof his new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins. On reaching\nthe spot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had\nevidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from\nits hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it\nwas leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable\nattitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his\nhorror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a\nrecumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity\nbed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow\nturnip lying at his feet! Unable to understand this curious\ntransformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there,\nin the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:--\n        +------------------------------------+\n        |         YE OTIS GHOSTE             |\n        | Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook, |\n        |    Beware of Ye Imitationes.       |\n        |   All others are counterfeite.     |\n        +------------------------------------+\nThe whole thing flashed across him. He had been tricked, foiled, and\nout-witted! The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his\ntoothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his\nhead, swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\nschool, that, when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds\nof blood would be wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.\n\nHardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of\na distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh,\nand waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\nreason, did not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back\nto his room, thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose. There he\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was\nexceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which this oath\nhad been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second time. \"Perdition\nseize the naughty fowl,\" he muttered, \"I have seen the day when, with my\nstout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow\nfor me an 'twere in death!\" He then retired to a comfortable lead\ncoffin, and stayed there till evening.\n\n\nCHAPTER: IV\n\n\nThe next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were\ncompletely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five\ndays he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point\nof the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want\nit, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a\nlow, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating\nthe symbolic value of sensuous phenomena. The question of phantasmic\napparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a\ndifferent matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large\noriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every month, and he\ndid not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is\nquite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand,\nhe was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.\n\nFor the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as\nusual between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible\nprecaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots,\ntrod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large\nblack velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for\noiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good\ndeal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of\nprotection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he\nslipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a\nlittle humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see\nthat there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a\ncertain degree, it served his purpose. Still in spite of everything he\nwas not left unmolested. Strings were continually being stretched across\nthe corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion,\nwhile dressed for the part of \"Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley\nWoods,\" he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide,\nwhich the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry\nChamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged\nhim, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and\nsocial position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the\nnext night in his celebrated character of \"Reckless Rupert, or the\nHeadless Earl.\"\n\nHe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in\nfact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means\nof it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord\nCanterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome\nJack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\ndown the terrace at twilight. Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\nLord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken\nheart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it\nhad been a great success. It was, however an extremely difficult\n\"make-up,\" if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more\nscientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three\nhours to make his preparations. At last everything was ready, and he was\nvery pleased with his appearance. The big leather riding-boots that went\nwith the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\nfind one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite\nsatisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting\nand crept down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins,\nwhich I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of\nthe colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make\nan effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water\nfell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his\nleft shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed. The shock to his\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\ncould go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold. The only\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\nhad not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences\nmight have been very serious.\n\nHe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,\nand contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in\nlist slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\ndraughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the\ntwins. The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September. He\nhad gone down-stairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that\nthere, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing\nhimself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of\nthe United States Minister and his wife which had now taken the place of\nthe Canterville family pictures. He was simply but neatly clad in a long\nshroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip\nof yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In\nfact, he was dressed for the character of \"Jonas the Graveless, or the\nCorpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,\" one of his most remarkable\nimpersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to\nremember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their\nneighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a quarter-past two o'clock in\nthe morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring. As\nhe was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any\ntraces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a\ndark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads,\nand shrieked out \"BOO!\" in his ear.\n\nSeized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural,\nhe rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him\nthere with the big garden-syringe, and being thus hemmed in by his\nenemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the\ngreat iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to\nmake his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own\nroom in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.\n\nAfter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins\nlay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\nservants, but it was of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings\nwere so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed\nhis great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had\nbeen engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized a wonderful\nclam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse\neuchre, poker, and other American national games, and Virginia rode\nabout the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire,\nwho had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville\nChase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in\nfact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who,\nin reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best\ncongratulations to the Minister's worthy wife.\n\nThe Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the\nhouse, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let\nmatters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the\nyoung Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had\nonce bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice\nwith the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the\nfloor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state that, though\nhe lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but\n\"Double Sixes.\" The story was well known at the time, though, of course,\nout of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt\nwas made to hush it up, and a full account of all the circumstances\nconnected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle's\nRecollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends. The ghost, then,\nwas naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence\nover the Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his\nown first cousin having been married en secondes noces to the Sieur de\nBulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are\nlineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to\nVirginia's little lover in his celebrated impersonation of \"The Vampire\nMonk, or the Bloodless Benedictine,\" a performance so horrible that when\nold Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in\nthe year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which\nculminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after\ndisinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and\nleaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment,\nhowever, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the\nlittle Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal\nBedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.\n\n\nCHAPTER: V\n\n\nA few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out\nriding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting\nthrough a hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go\nup by the back staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past\nthe Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied\nshe saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother's maid, who\nsometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend\nher habit. To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville\nGhost himself! He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of\nthe yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing\nmadly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his hand, and his\nwhole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so forlorn, and so\nmuch out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea\nhad been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity,\nand determined to try and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so\ndeep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she\nspoke to him.\n\n\"I am so sorry for you,\" she said, \"but my brothers are going back to\nEton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy\nyou.\"\n\n\"It is absurd asking me to behave myself,\" he answered, looking round in\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,\n\"quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and\nwalk about at night, if that is what you mean. It is my only reason for\nexisting.\"\n\n\"It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very\nwicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had\nkilled your wife.\"\n\n\"Well, I quite admit it,\" said the Ghost, petulantly, \"but it was a\npurely family matter, and concerned no one else.\"\n\n\"It is very wrong to kill any one,\" said Virginia, who at times had a\nsweet puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.\n\n\"Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very\nplain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about\ncookery. Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent\npricket, and do you know how she had it sent to table? However, it is\nno matter now, for it is all over, and I don't think it was very nice of\nher brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.\"\n\n\"Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost--I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry? I\nhave a sandwich in my case. Would you like it?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you,\nall the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\nvulgar, dishonest family.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Virginia, stamping her foot, \"it is you who are rude, and\nhorrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the\npaints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain\nin the library. First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and\nI couldn't do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the\nchrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese\nwhite, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing\nto look at, and not at all easy to paint. I never told on you, though I\nwas very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for\nwho ever heard of emerald-green blood?\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" said the Ghost, rather meekly, \"what was I to do? It is\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother\nbegan it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I\nshould not have your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of\ntaste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest\nin England; but I know you Americans don't care for things of this\nkind.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\nand improve your mind. My father will be only too happy to give you a\nfree passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind,\nthere will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are\nall Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\nhave a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family ghost.\"\n\n\"I don't think I should like America.\"\n\n\"I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,\" said Virginia,\nsatirically.\n\n\"No ruins! no curiosities!\" answered the Ghost; \"you have your navy and\nyour manners.\"\n\n\"Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week's\nholiday.\"\n\n\"Please don't go, Miss Virginia,\" he cried; \"I am so lonely and so\nunhappy, and I really don't know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I\ncannot.\"\n\n\"That's quite absurd! You have merely to go to bed and blow out the\ncandle. It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\nchurch, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why, even\nbabies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.\"\n\n\"I have not slept for three hundred years,\" he said sadly, and\nVirginia's beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; \"for three hundred\nyears I have not slept, and I am so tired.\"\n\nVirginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like\nrose-leaves. She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked\nup into his old withered face.\n\n\"Poor, poor Ghost,\" she murmured; \"have you no place where you can\nsleep?\"\n\n\"Far away beyond the pine-woods,\" he answered, in a low, dreamy voice,\n\"there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\nsings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold crystal\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\nsleepers.\"\n\nVirginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\n\n\"You mean the Garden of Death,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth,\nwith the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have\nno yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at\npeace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of death's\nhouse, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death\nis.\"\n\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\nthere was silence. She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\n\nThen the ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of\nthe wind.\n\n\"Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?\"\n\n\"Oh, often,\" cried the little girl, looking up; \"I know it quite well.\n\nIt is painted in curious black letters, and is difficult to read. There\nare only six lines:\n    \"'When a golden girl can win\n    Prayer from out the lips of sin,\n    When the barren almond bears,\n    And a little child gives away its tears,\n    Then shall all the house be still\n    And peace come to Canterville.'\n\n\"But I don't know what they mean.\"\n\n\"They mean,\" he said, sadly, \"that you must weep with me for my sins,\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle,\nthe angel of death will have mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\ncannot prevail.\"\n\nVirginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair\nas he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes. \"I am not afraid,\" she said\nfirmly, \"and I will ask the angel to have mercy on you.\"\n\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as\nhe led her across the dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were\nbroidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back. \"Go back! little Virginia,\"\n\nthey cried, \"go back!\" but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly,\nand she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails\nand goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and\nmurmured, \"Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,\"\n\nbut the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When\nthey reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she\ncould not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly\nfading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A\nbitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her\ndress. \"Quick, quick,\" cried the Ghost, \"or it will be too late,\" and\nin a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry\nChamber was empty.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VI\n\n\nAbout ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not\ncome down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia\nanywhere. As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\nevening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all\nalarmed at first, but when six o'clock struck, and Virginia did not\nappear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for\nher, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house. At\nhalf-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\nof their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of\nexcitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly\nremembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies\npermission to camp in the park. He accordingly at once set off for\nBlackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son\nand two of the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire, who was\nperfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too,\nbut Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a\nscuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gipsies had\ngone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as\nthe fire was still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.\n\nHaving sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran\nhome, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the\ncounty, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been\nkidnapped by tramps or gipsies. He then ordered his horse to be brought\nround, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down\nto dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with a groom. He had hardly,\nhowever, gone a couple of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after\nhim, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with\nhis face very flushed, and no hat. \"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,\" gasped\nout the boy, \"but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.\n\nPlease don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year,\nthere would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me back,\nwill you? I can't go! I won't go!\"\n\nThe Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace,\nand was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down\nfrom his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, \"Well,\nCecil, if you won't go back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must\nget you a hat at Ascot.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!\" cried the little Duke, laughing,\nand they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of\nthe station-master if any one answering to the description of Virginia\nhad been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her. The\nstation-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him\nthat a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a\nhat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his\nshutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away,\nwhich he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as there was a\nlarge common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman, but\ncould get no information from him, and, after riding all over the\ncommon, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase\nabout eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found\nWashington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with\nlanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest trace of\nVirginia had been discovered. The gipsies had been caught on Brockley\nmeadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they should be late. Indeed, they had\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's disappearance, as they\nwere very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his\npark, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search.\n\nThe carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone\nover, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any\nrate, Virginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest\ndepression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they\nfound a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\nwas poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and\nhaving her forehead bathed with eau de cologne by the old housekeeper.\n\nMr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up\nsupper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one\nspoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very\nfond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the\nentreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that\nnothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in\nthe morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down\nimmediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight\nbegan to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded\nthey heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder\nshook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a\npanel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out\non the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her\nhand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs.\nOtis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with\nviolent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.\n\n\"Good heavens! child, where have you been?\" said Mr. Otis, rather\nangrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them.\n\n\"Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and\nyour mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these\npractical jokes any more.\"\n\n\"Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!\" shrieked the twins, as they\ncapered about.\n\n\"My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side\nagain,\" murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair.\n\n\"Papa,\" said Virginia, quietly, \"I have been with the Ghost. He is dead,\nand you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was\nreally sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of\nbeautiful jewels before he died.\"\n\nThe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave\nand serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a\nlighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they\ncame to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia\ntouched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves\nin a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated\nwindow. Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was\na gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone\nfloor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers\nan old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its\nreach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was\ncovered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but\na pile of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding\nher little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the\nparty looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\ndisclosed to them.\n\n\"Hallo!\" suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out\nof the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\nsituated. \"Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.\"\n\n\"God has forgiven him,\" said Virginia, gravely, as she rose to her feet,\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.\n\n\"What an angel you are!\" cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round\nher neck, and kissed her.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VII\n\n\nFour days after these curious incidents, a funeral started from\nCanterville Chase at about eleven o'clock at night. The hearse was drawn\nby eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\nnodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\npurple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville\ncoat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\nservants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully\nimpressive. Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up\nspecially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first\ncarriage along with little Virginia. Then came the United States\nMinister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the\nlast carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had\nbeen frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she\nhad a right to see the last of him. A deep grave had been dug in the\ncorner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service\nwas read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, the servants, according to an old custom\nobserved in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as\nthe coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward,\nand laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms. As\nshe did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its\nsilent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a\nnightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of the\nGarden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a\nword during the drive home.\n\nThe next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given\nto Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby\nnecklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen\nof sixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis\nfelt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"I know that in this country mortmain is held to\napply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that\nthese jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg\nyou, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you\nunder certain strange conditions. As for my daughter, she is merely a\nchild, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such\nappurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I\nmay say, is no mean authority upon Art,--having had the privilege of\nspending several winters in Boston when she was a girl,--that these gems\nare of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\nprice. Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you\nwill recognize how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\nin the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such\nvain gauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\nBritish aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who\nhave been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles\nof Republican simplicity. Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box, as a memento of\nyour unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is extremely old, and\nconsequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to\ncomply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good deal\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with medi\u00e6valism\nin any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was\nborn in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned\nfrom a trip to Athens.\"\n\nLord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister's speech,\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile,\nand when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\nsaid: \"My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky\nancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are\nmuch indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck. The jewels\nare clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough\nto take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave\nin a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. As for their being\nheirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or\nlegal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite\nunknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and\nwhen Miss Virginia grows up, I dare say she will be pleased to have\npretty things to wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the\nfurniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to\nthe ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity\nSir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he\nwas really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase.\"\n\nMr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville's refusal, and\nbegged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was\nquite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to\nretain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of\n1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's first\ndrawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the\nuniversal theme of admiration. For Virginia received the coronet, which\nis the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her\nboy-lover as soon as he came of age. They were both so charming, and\nthey loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the\nmatch, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch\nthe Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less\nthan three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to\nsay, Mr. Otis himself. Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke\npersonally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his\nown words, \"was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating\ninfluences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of\nRepublican simplicity should be forgotten.\" His objections, however,\nwere completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the\naisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his\narm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of\nEngland.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to\nCanterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over\nin the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods. There had\nbeen a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir\nSimon's tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it\nsimply the initials of the old gentleman's name, and the verse from the\nlibrary window. The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses,\nwhich she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for\nsome time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There\nthe Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her\nfeet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly\nhe threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her,\n\"Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.\"\n\n\"Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have,\" he answered, smiling, \"you have never told me what\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.\"\n\n\"I have never told any one, Cecil,\" said Virginia, gravely.\n\n\"I know that, but you might tell me.\"\n\n\"Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you. Poor Sir Simon! I owe\nhim a great deal. Yes, don't laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see\nwhat Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than\nboth.\"\n\nThe Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.\n\n\"You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,\" he murmured.\n\n\"You have always had that, Cecil.\"\n\n\"And you will tell our children some day, won't you?\"\n\nVirginia blushed.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.\n\nYet Millet would have us understand that in spite of this, the\nshepherd is performing a duty to humanity not to be underrated. The\nsheep he has so carefully and conscientiously reared will form food\nto-morrow for many a hungry town-dweller. Further, he would have us\nfollow the peasant as he closes the pen for the night and traces his\ntired steps towards his simple home in the village. The frugal and\nhard-earned meal, prepared for him by his wife, who like himself has\nhad her share of duties to occupy her during the day, is partaken of\nsurrounded by a hungry and joyous group of children. Such themes\nsuggested by the simplicity of his own life appealed to him with\nirresistible force, and it is in their portrayal that his greatness is\nmanifested.\n\nPerhaps no season of the year presented the same attraction for Millet\nas the spring. The period when all the earth after its long winter\nsleep is about to waken into new life seems to have always been a\nsource of inspiration to him. In \"The Sower\" he emphasises the fact\nthat the fruits of the harvest are not to be had without due labour\nbeing expended upon the earth. The sloping field, barren of\nvegetation, and crowned at the top with a small clump of trees, is\nbeing broken up by the distant plough drawn by two horses and guided\nby a peasant. The latter figure is one of the noblest of Millet's\ncreations. By his strained and ever-attentive attitude, by his\ncontinuous tramp over the rough and broken ground, he shows us the\nmonotony of his toil. He crosses the field in one direction, only to\nreturn at an interval of a few feet. In the foreground we have the\nsower, a middle-aged man of typical peasant type, on whose left side a\nbag of seeds is slung. With automatic precision he withdraws a\nhandful, and strews it into the furrows open to receive it. So long as\nhe continues in the same track his labour will be well performed, and\nhence his task is just as monotonous as that of his fellow-worker\nhigher up in the field. The silhouetting of these two figures against\nthe light is symbolical of the labour to be expended in life before\nresults are forthcoming.\n\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that in considering the works of\nMillet, one must not judge him from the standpoint of a mere painter.\n\nHis brush is only the means to an end, and by its means he is enabled\nto bring the fruits of his philosophic observation before us in\npermanent form. It has been charged against the \"Angelus\" that it was\nnot a remarkably fine piece of painting, that many a young artist of\nthe present generation is infinitely better equipped, technically\nspeaking, than the master who wrought this celebrated canvas. This may\nin a measure be true, but it must never be forgotten that Millet\nbrought into play exactly the means which could illustrate his meaning\nin the clearest terms. He had not intended, in painting such a\npicture, to produce a work which would astonish his fellow artists\nwith its brilliancy of handling or magnificence of colour. He wanted\nto make the beholder forget the painter and absorb the lesson. This\nquality runs right through the art of Millet, and it is from this\nstandpoint that we are obliged to weigh his merits.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE\n\n\nJean Fran\u00e7ois Millet was born on October 4, 1814, that is at the\nperiod when French art, at any rate as far as landscape painting is\nconcerned, had reached its lowest ebb. Throughout the eighteenth\ncentury the landscape painter had been hard put to make a living. The\ntaste of connoisseurs throughout the century had been for portraits\nand interiors, or for those numerous pastoral subjects which were\ncarried out with so much decorative charm by such men as Watteau and\nBoucher. Such landscape painting as existed was of the type\npopularised by Vernet; it was built upon a curious mixture of Italian\ninfluence coming from Panini and Salvator Rosa. The only evidence of\nrevolt against such a state of affairs we find in the works of Hubert\nRobert and Moreau. These two, and more especially would I direct the\nreader's attention to the latter, struggled hard to break down the\nconventionalities of the time. They endeavoured to infuse some sense\nof atmosphere into their pictures, and whilst frequently their trees\nand figures are painfully formal, they yet stand alone in the French\nschool as the pioneers of a phase of art which was to attain its\nzenith in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBut after the Revolution, and during the whole of the time that France\nwas under the domination of Napoleon, very rigid principles indeed\nwere enforced with regard to the direction that art should take. The\ninnovation which had its commencement in the reign of Louis XVI. swept\neverything before it as it gained force. Classical art and traditions\ndominated the whole French school, and no artist, however great his\nreputation, attempted for many years to swim against the stream. In\nspite of the principles of liberty and equality which were claimed for\nall under the new r\u00e9gime, a terribly strict eye was kept upon any\ninnovations which might break out in the form of a naturalistic art.\n\nThe directors of this new movement failed to see that the conditions\nwhich had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed\naway, and that the latter's supremacy was due to the fact that their\nproductions were symbolical of the loftiest thoughts of their own\nepoch. The art which expresses the ambitions and noblest thoughts of\nits time will alone endure. These expressions are not applicable to\nany other condition than those which called them forth, and hence in\nattempting to purify the rococo which had existed up to the middle of\nthe eighteenth century, by a return to classical traditions, they were\nonly copying that which their predecessors had done, and in so doing\nleft us without any original expression of their own time.\n\nInto such a condition of affairs was Millet born, and he was numbered\namongst that little band of men which included Rousseau, Corot, Dupr\u00e9,\nDiaz, and Daumier, who were to lay the foundations of the modern\nnaturalistic school. At the outset it was seemingly a hopeless\nstruggle they undertook; a struggle against prejudice and influence\nwhich was only to be brought to a victorious culmination after years\nof struggle and disappointment. Of this little band, Millet was\nperhaps the best equipped for the privations which were necessary. He\ncame of a peasant stock who inhabited Gruchy, a small village\nsituated in the commune of Gr\u00e9ville, close to Cherbourg. Grouped\nunderneath the humble roof was the grandmother, who had been left a\nwidow fifteen years before; her son, Jean Louis Nicolas Millet, and\nhis wife and eight children, of which our artist was the second. His\ngrandmother appears to have been a pious old lady, whose chief delight\nwas in her grandchildren, to whom she taught those religious\nprinciples which stood them in good stead in after life. We are told\nthat Millet's father possessed a force of character one does not often\nfind amongst men in his rank of life. He was of a contemplative\ndisposition, and had a keenly developed feeling for natural beauty. He\npossessed moreover a keen appreciation of music, which unfortunately\nhe does not appear to have had much opportunity of cultivating. His\nwife was an excellent housewife and of a religious turn of mind. The\nhouse they occupied, situated quite a short distance from the sea, was\nplaced in a tract of country which, whilst it had rugged and\npicturesque features, was not of a nature which would yield\nextraordinary results under cultivation. It was, therefore, a hard\nstruggle for existence which Millet in his first years saw going\non around him. Not that the family were any the less happy for having\nto work laboriously for their livelihood. They had been brought up\namidst such surroundings; their wants were simple and easily\ngratified, and the tranquillity of the m\u00e9nage more than\ncounterbalanced those doubtful luxuries which easier circumstances\nwould have brought their way. Throughout his life Millet maintained\nthe extreme simplicity he had seen practised in the home of his\nchildhood, and long years afterwards he was accustomed to look back\nwith pleasureable memories upon his early years.\n\nGruchy, situated in one of the wildest parts of Normandy, feels the\nfull effect of every storm which blows up from the Atlantic. There is\nnothing to shelter the exposed hamlets studded along the coast from\nthe fury of the western gale, and the rocks are but too often strewn\nwith the wrecks of vessels which have come to grief in that terrible\nsea. Millet in his youth must have witnessed many of these\ncatastrophes. Quite a number of drawings by him are extant\nrepresenting succour being extended to some vessel in difficulties, or\nthe hauling up of some wreckage on to the rocks. The studious boy\nmust have been impressed as he saw the sternness of the combat in his\nnative country between men and nature; the wind-swept fields, and\nhills bare to the point of savageness. The very trees themselves\ndwarfed and gnarled; in their struggle with the elements they have\nbeen made tough and hardy as the inhabitants of the country\nthemselves, and, stunted as they are, yet show well that they can\nresist the force of the fiercest storm. The brooding and contemplative\ncharacter of the father having descended to the son, we can quite\nimagine the effect such surroundings would have upon him. As he looked\nback in after years upon his roamings in his native country, he\nappreciated the awe-inspiring character of the scenery in which he had\nbeen born. He would doubtless recall many a walk amidst the fields\nwith the wind blowing in his face as it rushed in from the Atlantic,\nthe rain beating hard upon the freshly ploughed fields, and the\ndistant figure of the ploughman struggling hard with his team against\nthe stiff sou'wester. The great mass of vapour overhead whirled before\nthe violence of the storm, casting grey and pearly light over the\nwhole scene, whilst far away on the top of the hill a clump of trees,\nbent with their resistance to the wind, are silhouetted against the\nsky. Many a drawing of this kind we encounter in the later work of\nMillet, which shows how his thoughts harked back in certain moments to\nthe scenes he had left behind him for ever.\n\nWe know that on one or two occasions he returned to Gruchy. Once or\ntwice he had urgent business which took him back, but sometimes he\nwent with no other purpose than to renew acquaintance with the scenes\nof yore.\n\nLittle Jean Fran\u00e7ois was his grandmother's favourite. It was she who\ntaught him the names of things which surrounded him, and perhaps\ndirected his thoughts in the channels to which they were finally to be\ndevoted. Her brother Charles, who formed one of the family, used to\ntake him for walks, telling him stories on the way. Millet was\ndevotedly attached to this old man, and when at the age of seven years\nhe lost him, the gap in his life thus left made an impression upon his\nmemory never to be effaced.\n\nFive years afterwards he was placed in the hands of the vicar for the\npurpose of preparing him for his first communion. The good man seems\nto have been taken with the child; he found him so attentive to all\nnatural phenomenon which was passing around him and intelligent in an\nunusual degree. He quickly learnt a considerable amount of Latin,\nwhich introduced him to the great classics. Unfortunately for Millet,\nthe vicar accepted an offer of transference to a better parish in the\nvicinity. The boy had made such progress with his master that it was\ndecided that he should go with him to his new abode. He was, however,\nso missed in his own home, that when he came back for his first\nholidays it was decided that he should not return.\n\nHe now gave serious attention to the agricultural pursuits of his\nfather. He threw himself heartily into the work of the farm, and\nassisted in the work of sowing and harvesting, of pruning and\nthrashing according to the season. His spare time was occupied in\nreading with avidity various masterpieces of literature. The authors\nhe found at hand were such as F\u00e9n\u00e9lon and Bossuet, but he developed a\ndecided preference, which lasted till the end of his life, for Virgil\nand the Bible.\n\nIt was at this time that his taste for art began to be developed.\n\nHe drew the objects he found around him, and soon acquired sufficient\nconfidence in his skill to execute a large drawing representing two\nshepherds keeping guard over their sheep. These first efforts date\nfrom about his seventeenth year, and foretell the advent of the style\nin which he was later to become pre-eminent.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE MIGRATION TO PARIS\n\n\nHow frequently has it happened that the first years in the life of a\ngenius have been employed in labour quite different from that to which\nthey should have been directed. Such a state of affairs the more often\noccurs when the sense of duty has been strong enough to overcome\ntemporarily the inclination to pursue the natural bent. In the case of\nMillet, however, the early years which he devoted to the farm and its\npursuits were by no means wasted. It is on record that he became very\nproficient in the various duties in which he was engaged, but at the\nsame time we can be quite sure that his extraordinary faculties of\nobservation were constantly being brought into play, and the fruits of\nhis observations are to be seen in the pictures of his mature period.\n\nA considerable portion of his spare time was taken up with drawing,\nnot only the persons and objects he found around him, but also\nsubjects suggested to him by the books he was in the habit of reading.\n\nHis family, so far from throwing any obstacles in his way, encouraged\nhim. In fact it was his father who took him first to Cherbourg in\norder to show a painter of that town, named Mouchel, the early\nproducts of his son's genius. The decision at which Millet p\u00e8re had\narrived was prompted by a drawing in charcoal of an old peasant\nwalking along the road, which had struck him forcibly as being a work\nof extraordinary merit. It says much for Mouchel's breadth of mind\nthat he was equally impressed with the drawings. A man who had been\nbrought up in the school of David, and who had lived in one of the\nmost reactionary periods of French art, was hardly to be expected to\ntake kindly to a style so diametrically opposed to all the traditions\ninto which he himself had been inculcated; certainly the young\nMillet, who had now arrived at the age of eighteen, had not developed\nthe extraordinary freedom which his works of ten years later\ndemonstrate. But there was sufficient originality even in his early\ndrawings to call forth condemnation from a man who had been so\nsaturated with the teaching of David.\n\nHe prevailed upon Millet to leave his son with him, and set him to\nwork to copy many well-known works of art which he brought before his\npupil by means of engravings. Two months were spent in this way when\nnews reached Millet that his father had been seized with sudden\nillness, and he was obliged in the circumstances to return to\nGr\u00e9ville. He arrived to find the old man unconscious, and very shortly\nafterwards he died.\n\nThis misfortune awoke in Millet a sense of duty which compelled him to\ndesert his studies in Cherbourg and superintend the management of the\nfarm. For some time he devoted himself entirely to his new duties, but\nthe struggle betwixt duty and genius continued; he gave himself to his\nwork with all the energy at his disposal, but his thoughts were ever\nwandering to his art.\n\nAdded to his own inclinations, his grandmother, who perceived his\nextraordinary gifts, strongly persuaded him to devote his attention\nentirely to art, and consequently after some little time he decided to\nreturn to Cherbourg. Here he entered the studio of M. Langlois, an\nartist whose reputation in the town was considerable. Again in this\nworthy man he came in contact with a painter who had been brought up\nentirely under classical influence. Langlois, who had in his early\ndays been a pupil of Gros, had absorbed the classical tradition to\nsuch an extent as to be incapable of appreciating any other style. He\nappears to have endeavoured to mould Millet in his own method rather\nthan develop the latent genius which the latter possessed. The\nincompatibility of these two men speedily caused the younger to strike\nout in his own way. He saw more good in frequenting the museums and\nmaking copies of such works as appealed to him than in listening to\nthe advice of his teacher. All this occurred, however, without any\nbreach of friendship occurring. On the contrary, Langlois, after\nperceiving the futility of inducing his pupil to follow in his\nfootsteps, did all he could to advance his interests.\n\nBy means of his influence some of Millet's drawings were brought\nbefore the Municipal Council, and Langlois suggested that Millet\nshould be sent to Paris in order to further his development, and that\nthe Council should set aside a modest pension to meet his requirements\nin that city. The discussion appears to have been very prolonged, and\nupon the question being put to a vote it was only carried by means of\nthe casting vote of the mayor. Four hundred francs was at first\nallotted to him in this way, which was further increased shortly\nafterwards to six hundred. Such encouragement, meagre though it was,\nwas sufficient to give him a foothold in the metropolis. He left\nCherbourg in January 1837, on a cold and raw day, the snow falling\nheavily throughout the entire journey, and arrived in Paris in a very\ndisheartened condition. The miserable weather, coupled with the long\njourney in which he had had time to think of the small sum which lay\nbetween him and starvation, going to a city which he had never seen\nbefore, had all served to work upon his nerves, and he entered the\ngreat city sick at heart and very despondent.\n\nOne of the first visits he made after he was somewhat settled down in\nParis was to the Louvre. Here he was brought into contact for the\nfirst time with many masters, who were to mould his yet plastic\ntemperament into the form which enabled him to give to the world, in\nlater years, so many masterpieces. As I have said before, it was\nMantegna who first captivated him, and the influence of the mighty\nPaduan was never finally to be shaken off. Michel Angelo awed him with\nhis sublimity; his classical severity tempered with intense humanism,\nhis masculine strength, were bound to have their effect upon so\nserious a character as Millet. Strange as it may seem to those who are\nbut superficially acquainted with his art, and are only too apt to\njudge him by the influence he has had upon modern French painting, he\nwas fascinated with the antique. The traditions of Phidias and\nPraxiteles, in the form in which they had been transmitted through the\ngreatest minds of the Renaissance, were ever the factors which guided\nhim throughout his career. It was this same spirit which impelled his\nfervid admiration for Nicolas Poussin, a master who to-day is sadly\nunderrated and but little understood. It was the mysteries of line,\nthe wonders of pose and composition rather than the magic of colour\nwhich appealed to him. He had a profound admiration for the glowing\ncanvases of Titian and Rubens, but he could never overlook entirely\ntheir defects of drawing or, in the case of Rubens, the tendency to\nvulgarity. From his remarks in after years it would appear that he was\nbaffled with the mysticisms of Velazquez and Rembrandt; pure painting\nitself could never hold him. He needed to grasp the message which lay\nbehind it before he felt fully taken into the confidence of the\npainter; and as the minds of the Dutchman and the Spaniard ran in\nquite different channels to his own, they spoke with a language he\nnever understood. That he had a perceptive and critically independent\nmind may be gauged from his enthusiasm for Delacroix, whose work he\nencountered for the first time at the Luxembourg.\n\nDuring this period of study he was carefully considering under what\nmaster he should place himself. His choice unhappily fell upon\nDelaroche. To any one acquainted with the work of the latter master,\na more unsuitable selection could not have been made. Delaroche and\nthe painters who surrounded him can be appropriately described as\nconstituting the back-wash of the Empire style, which had reached its\nclimax with David. His subjects were always treated with academic\nreserve. No pyrotechnics were permitted; on the contrary, an\neverlasting and mistaken striving for finish was encouraged:\noriginality was sternly suppressed. To paint human life as it really\nwas, was too vulgar for any of the painters of this time. They held\nthe public taste enslaved for years. An innovator such as Millet was\ndestined to become found his position almost untenable. The band of\ncritics and painters formed a monopoly which it seemed almost\nimpossible to break down, and it was only after years of bitter and\ndetermined struggle that the school of nature finally routed its\nopponent.\n\nDelaroche doubtlessly found the peasant painter a little rude both in\nhis person and in his ideas about art. He paid but little attention to\nthe young man who had placed himself in his hands, and devoted all his\ntime to students who were more amenable to his influence. A\ntemperament so sensitive as Millet's was bound to notice this\nneglect, and consequently after a time he became so discouraged that\nhe ceased to frequent Delaroche's studio. Another very good reason for\nthis action was the lack of resources to continue his payments. Even\nduring the time he had been with Delaroche he lost no opportunity of\nturning a few honest francs by painting the portraits of any who could\nbe got to sit to him. Delaroche, however, had a more kindly heart than\nMillet imagined. He seems to have found out the real distress of the\nyoung artist, and to have assisted him pecuniarily in many ways, and\nthere is no doubt that he appreciated the talent of the young Norman\nmuch more than he cared to own. Many of his remarks on record would\nserve to show that Delaroche already felt that his pupil was destined\nto be one of the leaders of the movement which was finally to\noverthrow his own style, and doubtlessly felt a great admiration for a\nman who had the courage and strength to swim against rather than with\nthe current.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STRUGGLE FOR RECOGNITION\n\n\nFreed from all encumbrances save poverty, Millet was now to work out\nhis own destiny according to the dictates of his genius. He joined a\nfriend named Marolle, and the two together occupying a very small\napartment endeavoured to eke out an existence. It was only too soon\napparent that young as he was, and the taste of the public being not\nyet ready for development upon the lines his genius directed him, that\nhis livelihood could not be secured by endeavouring to sell such\nsubjects as appealed to him. In these straits he turned to\nportrait-painting, just as many great painters before and since him\nhave done. That the struggle was very keen can well be imagined by the\nfact that he was unable to obtain more than five to ten francs apiece;\nand, as commissions were very scarce, he was hard put to gain the\nmeans of subsistence. This state of affairs lasted until 1840, in\nwhich year he endeavoured to obtain admission to the Salon with two\nportraits, one of which was that of his friend. This, however, was\nrejected, and the other picture, although accepted, was unnoticed by\neither the critics or the public.\n\nHaving occasion the next year to pay a visit to Cherbourg, he felt\nobliged to report himself to the Municipal Council who had had the\ngenerosity to send him in the first place to Paris. Its worthy members\nexpressed themselves as but little satisfied with the result of their\ninvestment; they claimed that they had had as yet but little to show\nfor their money, and they suggested, partly as a means of\ndemonstrating that they had had some little return, and also, in order\nto see of what stuff their prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was made, that he should paint a\nportrait of the recently deceased mayor. As Millet had not been\npersonally acquainted with that worthy citizen, and as the only guide\nwhich could be supplied him was a portrait made in miniature when he\nwas a young man of some twenty-three or twenty-four years of age, the\ntask was by no means easy. However, the artist set to work with a\nwill, and finally accomplished the picture to his own satisfaction.\n\nUpon it being shown to the Council, one and all declared, as any one\nwith the slightest knowledge of such matters could have told them\nbefore it was commenced, that it bore not the least resemblance to the\ndefunct magistrate. They therefore demurred at the three hundred\nfrancs they had agreed to pay him for the portrait, and offered him\none-third of that amount instead. Millet was deeply offended by the\ninsult, and informed the Council that he made them a present of the\npicture.\n\nIt was during this short visit to his native country that he met his\nfirst wife, a Mlle. Ono, whose portrait he had painted. From the first\nshe was very delicate, and he lost her after much suffering, three\nyears later. His second wife was Mlle. Catherine Lemaire, who was\ndestined to be the companion of his struggles until the end of his\nlife.\n\nMeanwhile Millet was occupied with subjects which he thought would\nappeal to the general public. A number of classical pictures date from\nthis epoch. It was an endeavour on his part to fall in as far as\npossible with the current taste, and so supply means of subsistence\nfor his family. At the same time he did not neglect his favourite\nsubjects, and many are the wonderful studies of peasant life which\ndate from these years. His reputation had so far advanced that he was\noffered the position of teacher of drawing in the college at\nCherbourg. It must have been only after prolonged deliberation that he\nrefused the proffered post. Here a certain annual stipend was assured\nhim, and if it was not large in itself it would at any rate suffice to\nkeep the wolf from the door. He preferred, however, to return to Paris\nand work out his own destiny as best he might.\n\nMillet, who lived at this time in the Rue Rochechouart, began to\nsurround himself with that little group of friends who remained\nfaithful to him until the end of his career. Amongst the earliest were\nCharles Jacque and Diaz: the latter had several clients amongst the\nsmall dealers, whom he induced to visit Millet's studio and make now\nand again a small purchase.\n\nMillet now became a fairly regular contributor to the Salon, but\ngenerally sent some classical or religious picture as well as one of\nhis peasant subjects. For example, in 1848 he sent the marvellous\nstudy of \"The Winnower,\" which we all know so well, accompanied by a\ncanvas, \"The Captivity of the Jews at Babylon.\" The latter, however,\nwas so badly received that he utilised the canvas upon its return for\na large picture of a \"Shepherdess tending her Sheep.\"\n\nIn spite of the headway that he was making, the struggle for existence\nseemed keener than ever, and but for the kindness of friends he and\nhis family would frequently have actually wanted for food. A timely\nadvance of one hundred francs obtained for him from the Minister of\nFine Arts, together with a commission from the State, for which he was\npaid the sum of eighteen hundred francs, were for some time the only\nrelief he obtained from his embarrassments. That he was not particular\nas to how he earned his daily bread is apparent from the fact that he\ndid not despise an order for a shop sign for a midwife, for which he\nwas paid the miserable amount of thirty francs.\n\nThe year 1848 was not an encouraging one for a painter who was\nstanding on the threshold of his career. The whole of Europe was\nseething with revolution. A repetition of the fearful year of 1792 was\neverywhere expected. The struggle betwixt reaction and property on the\none hand, and lawlessness and revolution on the other, was being waged\nwith grim determination. The issue was for long in the balance. One\nnever knew from one day to another what was going to happen. In such a\ndeplorable state of affairs men's minds were running on politics and\nwars rather than upon art. Millet amongst the rest was called upon to\nshoulder the musket, and it can be easily imagined with what\nreluctance he did so.\n\nParis, the great centre of art, had yet not afforded him much\nencouragement. Life was dear in the big city, and surrounded on all\nsides by bricks and mortar he was not free to go out into the fields\nand study the objects which were uppermost in his mind. He resolved to\nescape from it, and once having put the plan into execution he never\nreturned.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET IN HIS MATURITY\n\n\nThe Barbizon of 1850 was a very different place from the Barbizon of\nto-day. The world fame of the men who passed a quiet and strenuous\nexistence in the little village has transformed it into a tourist\nresort, with restaurants and caf\u00e9s, the stopping-places for\nwaggonettes which in summer bring their daily load of sightseers,\neager to see the homes of the painters whose names are now household\nwords.\n\nIt would have been well-nigh impossible for the little band to have\nchosen a more suitable spot for their labours. Rousseau and Millet,\nmuch as they were drawn towards each other by the tie of a sympathetic\ndisposition and by their common interest in art, yet were widely\ndissimilar from one another in their outlook upon art and their\nmethods of worship at the common shrine. Rousseau--one can see it from\nevery picture he painted--loved with all the yearning of a passionate\nand restless temperament the inanimate in Nature. Observe with what\nfidelity he draws his trees, with what caressing tenderness his clouds\nand skies are treated; solitude appealed to him above all things, and\nif here and there he was obliged to insert a few figures to complete\nhis composition, one instinctively feels that he would rather have\nsubstituted a group of cattle or a flock of sheep. In the glades of\nthe forest, far from the busy haunts of men, with the glorious\nsunlight penetrating from above, the breeze moaning through the\nbranches, he was happy. A wild and turbulent temperament such as his\nnot infrequently discovers exquisite enjoyment amidst such perfect\ntranquillity.\n\nBarbizon, situated on the fringe of the great forest of Fontainebleau,\ntherefore, permitted Rousseau to come into daily contact with the\nscenes which so appealed to him.\n\nMillet, on the other hand, was absorbed in the peasant. The man who\ntilled the soil and raised the produce humanity requires for its\nsubsistence by the sweat of his brow; the manifold duties of the\nlabourer, his life and sorrows, appealed to him with irresistible\nforce. An unpeopled track of wild and uncultivated land would not call\nforth any emotion in him, no matter how sublime the scenery might be.\n\nThe life of the village, spreading itself into the vast and fertile\nplain behind, held him absorbed; a peasant himself and living amongst\nthe people he so loved, he was in a position to bring before an\nunthinking world the poignant monotony of their useful lives.\n\nUpon their first arrival at Barbizon, the two artists put up at a\nsmall inn, working all day in a tiny place they had rented from some\npeasants and fitted up as a studio. The inconveniences of this\narrangement were soon apparent, and shortly afterwards Millet took a\nsmall house which was destined to be his abode for the remainder of\nhis life; an old barn in the immediate vicinity meanwhile provided him\nwith an excellent studio.\n\nFrom this period onward we must date the greatest productions of the\nmaster, the works which have induced more thought than those of any\nother peasant painter. A peasant among peasants, his life was of the\nmost rigid simplicity. Behind his little abode a large garden\nstretched away almost to the fringe of the forest itself, and here he\nwas accustomed to work every morning, growing a portion of the food\nnecessary to the sustenance of his family. The afternoon he devoted to\npainting, whilst the evening was given over to intercourse with his\nlittle circle of friends. The simplicity and tranquillity of his life\naroused the whole of his powers to action, and surrounded with\neverything he valued in life he was supremely happy.\n\nThe country around Barbizon appealed to him irresistibly. The\ntimber-studded plains, the gently undulating, highly cultivated\nfields, presented a strange contrast to the wild and rugged country\namidst which he had spent his childhood, and no doubt conduced to the\ndevelopment of a more refined and contemplative style than he would\notherwise have acquired. Upon his few visits to his native country he\nappears to have been more impressed than ever with its austerity, and\nthe drawings which these journeys called forth bore ample evidence of\nthis feeling in him.\n\nLack of the necessary funds to carry on even his simple m\u00e9nage was\never the bane of Millet's life. On many occasions Sensier, his\nintimate friend and afterwards his biographer, informs us he dissuaded\nhim from suicide.\n\nThe sums that he owed, small though they were, rendered him in\nconstant fear of the brokers. With creditors so importunate in their\ndemands for satisfaction, and with the constant lack of recognition,\nwhich was his lot, it is astonishing that Millet achieved so much. He\nwas relieved more than once by the kind-hearted and ever faithful\nRousseau, who when his friend was sorest pressed found some delicately\nhidden means to relieve him. It was he who acquired for 4000 francs\nthe wonderful \"Peasant grafting a Tree,\" when the picture failed to\nfind a purchaser; and in order that Millet should not be aware of his\ngenerosity, he made the offer in the name of an imaginary American.\n\nThis sort of goodness he repeated more than once, and it redounds\nstill more to his credit when we remember that Rousseau himself was\nnot infrequently in pecuniary difficulties.\n\nA constant succession of important works made their appearance during\nthe first ten years Millet spent at Barbizon. The first was the\nwell-known \"Sower,\" which has ever been one of the most popular of his\npictures. Then came the far finer \"Peasants going to Work,\" which for\nmany years was in an English Collection. The \"Gleaners,\" perhaps the\nnoblest canvas the master ever painted, dates from 1857, in which year\nit was seen at the Salon; the celebrated \"Angelus\" followed it two\nyears later. The prices which Millet obtained for this series of\nremarkable works was fantastically small. The \"Gleaners\" brought him a\npaltry 2000 francs, whilst he accounted himself lucky to encounter an\namateur who gave him the same sum for the small \"Woman feeding Fowls.\"\n\nThe \"Angelus,\" which was never exhibited, was sold in the year it was\npainted to a Monsieur Feydeau, an architect, for 1800 francs. It then\npassed through several hands before the late Monsieur Secr\u00e9tan\ncompeted up to 160,000 francs before he became possessed of the prize\nat the John Wilson sale.\n\nThe purchase, however, proved a sound investment, for upon the\ndispersal of his collection it was knocked down for 553,000 francs to\na Monsieur Proust, acting on behalf of the French Government. The\nlatter, however, when they gave the commission to buy the picture, had\nno idea that such a high value would be placed upon it, and\nconsequently refused to ratify the sale; a syndicate now came upon the\nscene, who took it to America. The price, however, proved greater than\neven the millionaires of the States were prepared to give, and the\ncanvas again returned to France, where it found a resting-place in the\ncollection of Monsieur Chauchard, who paid the enormous sum of 800,000\nfrancs for its possession.\n\nIn 1859 Millet sent two works to the Salon, a \"Woman grazing her Cow,\"\nand \"Death and the Woodman.\" The latter, one of the most\nphilosophical of Millet's pictures, which to-day is the principal\nattraction of the Jacobsen Museum at Copenhagen, was rejected.\n\nDisappointments of this kind came with such systematic regularity to\nthe painter that he must have become proof against them. He always had\nbitter enemies amongst the critics, who never failed to pour abuse\nupon his method and his subjects. Even a number of his fellow artists\njoined in the chorus of disapproval. But the vehemence with which he\nwas attacked was striking evidence of the impression he was making and\nthe inward sense of his own powers; and the fact that he was working\nout his destiny according to the dictates of his own genius supported\nhim against this outpouring of prejudice and malice. The social side\nof life appealed to him more strongly as the years rolled on, and the\nmurmurings which had been heard in 1859 as to the socialistic\ntendencies of \"Death and the Woodman\" swelled to a roar when the\nstupendous \"Man with the Hoe\" was exhibited fourteen years later. The\nlatter, one of the most virile studies of depraved humanity which the\nworld has ever seen, has always been a favourite with social\nreformers, and has inspired one remarkable poem. Even his most\nimplacable critics were disarmed before this canvas; its power was\nmagnetic; it was an inspiration, soul moving and trenchant.\n\nHis financial difficulties never completely dispersed. At one time, in\norder to insure himself a little tranquillity, he made a contract with\ntwo speculators, whereby they were to become possessors of all the\nwork he produced for three years, in consideration of their assuring\nhim a thousand francs a month. A great number of Millet's finest\nproductions passed thus through their hands, including the \"Return\nfrom the Fields\" and the \"Man with the Hoe.\" The partners were not\nlong in quarrelling, and after a lawsuit had been fought, Millet was\nleft in the hands of a man who frequently would not or could not pay\nhim in ready money, and whose bills he was frequently forced to\ndiscount at considerable loss.\n\nOne little gleam of sunshine rendered his later days happy. This was a\ncommission from a Colmar banker, Monsieur Thomas by name, who required\nfour allegorical compositions representing the Seasons, to decorate\nhis rooms. The artist was overjoyed by this piece of good fortune,\nand immediately commenced a most conscientious study of such mural\ndecoration as was within reach, in order that he might do full justice\nto his patron. He paid frequent visits to Fontainebleau and the\nLouvre, and even desired a friend to inquire if he could not obtain\nreproductions of the frescoes at Herculaneum and Pompeii. In spite of\nall this elaborate preparation, the subjects were not such as appealed\nto his genius, and in spite of them being well and soundly painted, we\nare told that they presented no features which called for special\ncomment.\n\nHe found, however, a much more genial occupation in accomplishing a\nseries of drawings ordered by a Monsieur Gavet, who paid the artist\n1000, 700, and 450 francs each, according to their size. He made\naltogether ninety-five drawings in this way, and it is said that this\ngentleman had in his possession the finest work in black and white and\nwater-colour the artist ever executed.\n\nTowards the latter end of his life the death of dear relatives and\nfriends cast a sorrowful gloom over him. Amongst the latter Rousseau,\nwho expired in his presence on the 22nd of December 1867, was\nperhaps the loss which seemed to him hardest to bear. A staunch and\ntrusty friend, who was to be relied upon when his prospects seemed the\nmost hopeless, he had been one of the very few who had appreciated\nMillet's talents at their full worth, and who, moreover, scanty as his\nown means were, was ever ready to stretch out his hand to assist his\nstruggling friend.\n\nShortly afterwards Millet paid a visit to his patron, Herr Hartmann,\nat M\u00fcnster, and from here he went for a short time into Switzerland.\n\nUpon his return he devoted himself with great earnestness to work, and\nachieved a certain success at the Salons with his exhibits. The\noutbreak of the war with Germany caused him to migrate with his family\nto Cherbourg, where he thought he might continue to work, removed as\nfar as possible from the scenes of carnage and struggle which were\ngoing on farther east. Transported once more amongst the scenes of his\nchildhood, he felt an increased impetus to production, and when he\nreturned to Barbizon late in 1871, he brought with him a number of\ncanvases of the highest quality; conspicuous amongst them was the\nwonderful \"Gr\u00e9ville Church,\" now in the Louvre.\n\nThe anxieties of his troublous life were, however, beginning to show\ntheir effect upon his constitution; a persistent cough developed, and\nalthough an amelioration would occasionally occur, it was always\nsucceeded by a worse condition than before. His health suffered a\ngeneral decline, and he finally breathed his last on the 20th of\nJanuary 1875. He was buried in the little cemetery of Chailly, beside\nhis friend Rousseau, amidst the scenery they both loved so well.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE MAN AND HIS ART\n\n\nMillet is an instance of an artist working out his own destiny,\nimpelled by irresistible genius, in the teeth of seemingly\ninsurmountable obstacles. He started life with enormous disadvantages;\nwithout friends in influential circles to spread his fame or plead his\ncause; without money to enable him to outlive and triumph over the\nignorant fanaticism of critics and artists, so soaked in the\nconventionalised art of their time that they had not perception enough\nto appreciate the full meaning of that naturalistic movement, which\nwas finally to sweep away the quasi-classic art they boasted of with\nsuch bombastic effusion. The path was hard and thorny, and his triumph\nwas not finally consummated until after his death. He himself found\nhis only satisfaction in the fact that he had lived his life according\nto the dictates of his genius, and had achieved the maximum of which\nhe was capable.\n\nMillet and our own Cotman were somewhat kindred spirits; there is much\nmore affinity between the work of the two men than is apparent to any\none who has not closely studied them. The marvellous \"Breaking the\nClod,\" now happily permanently housed at the British Museum, betrays\nthe same tremendous conception and broad outlook which characterises\nmany a drawing of Millet's. Both highly strung to a painful extent,\nthey were each conscious of their inability to curb the power which\nprescribed a certain course for them, and in spite of pecuniary\ndifficulties and unpopularity, an inevitable result of their intense\noriginality, they pursued a steady course to the end of their lives.\n\nThe socialistic doctrines which have been read into the work of Millet\nare rather the outcome of the world's uneasy conscience being brought\nface to face with a crushing indictment of existing conditions, than\nof any design on the artist's part to further the cause of a political\npropaganda by means of his art. This somewhat extravagant reading into\nhis art has certainly been carried to excess. Particularly has such\nbeen the case in America, where a large number of his finest works are\nat present to be found, curiously enough in the hands of enormously\nwealthy people, who are frequently perhaps the least able to\nunderstand the real meaning of his message.\n\nComing from a peasant stock, his sympathies were always with the\npeasant; it was the only class he understood or cared for. He lived as\none of them, and shared to a large extent in their labour. He has been\ndesignated, not inappropriately, the philosopher in sabots. Rightly or\nwrongly he has come to be looked upon as one of the high priests of\ncommunistic doctrines. Few pictures have been so anathematised as the\n\"Man with the Hoe,\" and perhaps none have done more to inculcate\nsympathy with the degradation of the lower orders of the human race.\n\nThe revolting brutality and vacancy of that face haunts the\nimagination. Is it possible that fellow-creatures so utterly debased\nby toil and neglect exist? Millet dispels any doubt upon the question\nby bequeathing to humanity this trenchant portrait. By no means\nlimited to Barbizon or France, these poor creatures exist in every\ncountry, and curiously enough are considered an essential element in\neach country's development.\n\nThis poignantly human note is observable in almost every work Millet\nwrought; his passionate sympathy with his fellow-man is the keynote of\nhis art. The wood-cutter in his arduous toil, the shepherd in his\nsolitariness, the labourer turning the soil with unvarying and\nlaborious monotony, the mother caring for her children--all carry the\nsame message for him of that strange and incomprehensible mingling of\njoy and sadness we call life. Like many great minds before and since\nhis time, our artist found the greatest joy in life in a placid and\nnever changing melancholy. But the peasants he chose knew nothing of\nthe sadness he saw in them. Completely inured to their toil, and\nsubdued by it, with no refining or uplifting influence to stimulate\nthem, they knew nothing, aspired to nothing beyond what they were; it\nwas left to Millet to supply the \"might have been.\" He saw the inky\nblackness of the mind of the \"Man with the Hoe,\" the pathetic\ninequality between the mounted farmer directing the safe storage of\nhis crop, and the stooping figures of the \"Gleaners\" eager to scrape\nup the miserable crumbs which had fallen from the rich man's table. He\ntraced the lives of these simple folk until we arrive at the grim and\ngaunt figure of Death, who, as he grasps the woodman by the shoulder,\nreminds him that his course is finished and that he, in common with\nall his fellow-men, must enter the great unknown land from which there\nis no return. It is a sad and melancholy art, vibrating with purity\nand truth, the outpouring of a great soul yearning to express itself\nto the utmost of its power. The mind and character of the man can be\nread in every line and in every touch of the brush. His drawings and\netchings are even more searching in their virility than his pictures.\n\nThere is a spontaneousness about them we search for in vain in his\nwork in oil and pastel. In black and white his intensely emotional\nmind found a swift method of expression; in the laboriousness of oil\npainting he was fettered with the complications of the medium. It can\nbe fairly said that only in one or two paintings--a notable example\ncan be cited in the wondrous \"Sawyers\" at South Kensington--does he\nrise to the height of a great painter. Millet was a poet, a\nphilosopher, a great thinker, and the means he chose for expressing\nhimself were those which were best fitted to his purpose. His\npredilections in art were concentrated upon the greatest, and\nconsequently the men who appealed to him were the thinkers of the\nages. Mantegna and Correggio, Michel Angelo and the mighty Greeks,\nthese were the masters who left their impress upon his mind and art.\n\nThe influence of so sincere and profound an artist has necessarily\nbeen profound. He has moulded men who have achieved world-wide fame;\nSegantini, for example, would never have risen to the heights he did\nhad the example of Millet not been ever before him. There have been\nmany who, without possessing his genius, have endeavoured to follow\nin his footsteps, but successfully as his imitators have sometimes\ncaught his style, their productions can never live alongside his,\nbecause they lack the real ring of sincerity.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n        a. One bed, or folding cot,\n        b. One oil stove,\n        c. One lamp,\n        d. Enough supplies of all kinds sufficient for six months,\n        e. Pots, pans, kettles, etc.\nIt is needless to say that positions in Manila and Iloilo were now at\na premium.\n\nWas it possible that teachers were to be sent to places where even the\nnecessaries of life could not be obtained! Was it possible that many\nwould be sent to places so remote that for six months no fresh\nsupplies could be gotten! A mass meeting was held at once, and a\ncommittee was appointed to send a cablegram to the Associated Press\npetitioning aid from the American people at large. Realizing what\nconsternation would be created throughout the United States by such a\nmessage, two of the teachers leaped into a carriage at the close of\nthe meeting and a few moments later were closeted with the chief\nexecutive of the department. As a result the committee was persuaded\nnot to send the cablegram to the Associated Press until by courtesy it\nhad been sent to the President. Of course, this diplomatic move tided\naffairs over and the teachers who had flatly refused to budge from\nManila now agreed to go on to their stations, being assured that\nwhatever action was best would be taken.\n\nThe day had come when we must separate. We were to enter an untried\nand an unknown field. It was fitting that we have a final joyous\nmeeting, so the best orchestra in the archipelago was engaged and we\n\"chased the hours with flying feet\" until dawn so that whatever might\ncome to us in that unknown future upon which we were entering each\nwould hold in pleasant memory our last evening together.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER III. - A DRAMA IN ACTUAL LIFE.\n\n\nAlmost every one heeded the warning to go to his station forearmed\nwith at least necessaries of life, but, as it had never fallen to the\nlot of the writer to cook, he refused to learn at that late day, so he\ntook no pot, no pan, no kettle, putting his future into the hands of\nan uncertain fate and relying upon the unknown hospitality of the\nFilipino.\n\nBacalod, the capital of the province of Occidental Negros, was our\ndestination. The second morning after leaving Manila, we awoke with\nthe \"Kilpatrick\" lying at anchor in a shallow bay. We were several\nmiles from the shore and nothing in sight indicated that we had\nreached a place of any importance. Late the night before we had been\nawakened by the loud, sharp ringing of the ship's bells, accompanied\nby the reversal of the engines and a general disturbance awaking the\ncrew. So our first impressions on coming on deck were that we had run\naground. But the captain assured us that everything was ship-shape and\nthat this was the nearest point of approach to Capiz, a town of\nconsiderable importance on the island of Panay, where a body of troops\nwas to embark for home. Not even the grass hut of a native was in\nsight. Search as we would, not a sign was seen of a stream flowing\ninto the sea, indicating the probable presence of a town. There was\nnot a sign of life of any kind save one lone column of thin, blue\nsmoke that arose from the side of a mountain miles away. One would\nhave thought that we were explorers of three hundred years ago lying\noff the shore of some unknown land.\n\nAfter breakfast the steam launch, together with all the boats, was\nlowered, and several of us who had determined to miss no opportunity\nto gather information about the islands took our places in the launch\nby the side of the ship's mate, and steamed away across the water with\na long line of boats strung out in the rear. We headed away toward a\ngroup of cocoanut trees, and about an hour later stepped ashore on a\npile of decayed coral rocks that extended some twenty or thirty feet\nout into the water, thus forming the only landing place of a town of\nseveral thousands of people and of considerable commercial importance.\n\nA few moments after we had landed, an army wagon drawn by a\nmagnificent pair of mules came up out of a tropical jungle along a\nnarrow road. We clambered into the wagon and were soon lost in the\ndepths of foliage from which we had just seen the vehicle emerge.\n\nLong waving bamboos with their plumy leafage hung over the road from\neach side, meeting and overlapping in the center until they formed an\narchway so dense that the tropical sun now high in the heavens\npenetrated it only at intervals. At times the wagon sank up to the\nhubs in the soft earth, and the muscles of the mules stood out like\nwhip-cords under the skin as they drew us forward.\n\nAt a sharp turn in the road we came upon the first division of troops\nthat was to embark for home. The look of joy upon their sun-browned\nfaces was inexpressible. Their work was done, and with elastic step\nand smiling faces they saluted us as they passed by. The reign of\nforce was at an end; it was going out with them; the reign of peace\nhad begun; it was coming in with us.\n\nIn the afternoon when we returned from the town the last of the troops\nhad arrived and, as we drove up, the bugle was sounding the call to\nsupper. We noticed native women mingling with the troops and, indeed,\na native woman was in constant attention waiting upon one of the\nsoldiers with whom we ate. Her clothes were clean, her hair was nicely\ncombed, and her general appearance was neat. She seemed to anticipate\nthe slightest wish of the soldier with whom she was. She brought him\nwater to drink, cleaned his plate after the meal and saw that his\nknife, fork, and spoon were put into his haversack.\n\nWe had now finished supper and the launch had returned for the last\nload of troops. The lieutenant in command of the company gave the\norder to \"fall in\"; the men shouldered their rifles and fell into\nline. \"Forward, march!\" called the lieutenant, and the column swept\nforward towards the boats. The women had until now restrained\nthemselves, but, as their husbands marched away never to return, their\nfeelings could no longer be restrained. One young woman of about\neighteen, who was leaning against a rock by the roadside sobbing, when\nher husband passed, leaped up in frenzy of passionate love and caught\nthe rifle from his shoulder. Her first impulse seemed to be to throw\nthe gun away, but suddenly realizing the futility of such an act she\nburst into tears, shouldered the rifle herself and marched on by his\nside. Another woman of more mature age threw her arms around the legs\nof a tall stalwart man, and drew him bodily from the line.\n\nBut the troops marched on and entered the boats. One woman who had\nbeen unnoticed before came down into the shallow water and caught hold\nof our last boat as if to prevent its leaving, while others stood\nmingling their sobs with the sounds of the wavelets as they broke on\nthe sands. As we passed away, an expectant mother, standing in bold\noutline against the twilight sky, threw up her hands in an agony of\ndespair and then sank upon the stones. The curtain had fallen upon a\ndrama in actual life deeper in pathos than any other we had ever seen\nor ever expected to see. Depth of passion, depth of love! Who can\nfathom the human heart?\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. - WHAT THE TEACHERS DID.\n\n\nThere is a remarkable sameness about the towns in the Philippines.\n\nThey all have a large open square about the middle of the town, around\nthree sides of which are Chinese stores, unless one side lies open to\nthe sea, and on the fourth is the great stone ecclesia. The streets\nrun at right angles to one another and divide up the town into\ncreditable squares.\n\nEverybody in the Philippines lives up-stairs, for the ground is so\nsoaked with water during the rainy season that it is a menace to\nhealth to live upon the ground floor. So even the poorest nippa hut\nis built upon stakes four or five feet above the ground.\n\nBacalod is a typical Philippine town. As we landed, a broad open\nsquare was spread out before us. Two sides of the square were lined\nwith two-story houses in which were Chinese stores below and Filipino\nhomes above. On the third side stood the great stone church in whose\nmassive tower the clock was striking the hour of four, while the\nfourth lay open to the sea that had borne us thither.\n\nWe landed, but it was in a method new to us and one not usually\nemployed by the traveling public.\n\nWhen our sail boat ran aground on the sandy bottom a hundred yards or\nmore from the shore, a crowd of Filipino men who were on the beach\nslowly rolled up their pantaloons and waded out to the rescue,--for\nthe money that was in it. The boat's crew elevated their trousers'\nlegs also and slided down into the water. Each of us then straddled\nthe neck of a Filipino standing in the water and was held by ankles to\nbe steadied while our biped mounts proceeded to the shore.\n\nWe were now on the ground and face to face with the situation. To give\nthe reader an idea of the actual conditions met by the first teachers\nwho went to the Islands, the following is copied from the instructions\ngiven us in Manila:\n    1. There shall be two sessions daily of all schools, and the\n    last hour of the morning session shall be devoted solely to\n    instructing the Filipino teachers.\n\n    2. In cases where teachers are sent to a town in which there\n    is no school-house, they are expected to secure the aid of the\n    people and have one built.\n\n    3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is\n    stopped.\n\n    4. All supplies must be kept under lock and key. In towns\n    where there is no case or box to lock the supplies in, and it\n    is also impossible to get the town council to furnish a case,\n    a requisition may be sent to Manila, and, if an appropriation\n    can be secured, one will be made and sent out.\n\nThus it can be easily seen that we were indeed pioneers. In many\nplaces no school-house was to be found, and in some cases it was even\ndifficult to get the town council to provide a case in which to keep\nthe supplies.\n\nThe work of the teachers was, in short; to \"make the English language\nthe basis of instruction in the public schools.\" On our arrival at\nBacalod two schools were found in progress, for some soldiers had been\ndetailed for the work here previous to our coming. One of these was\nfor boys and the other, for girls. Thus the work here had been in a\nmeasure simplified, but complications that had arisen at Talisay, one\nof the largest and richest towns on the island, demanded a change of\nteachers and the writer was assigned to the place as superintendent.\n\nHere an attempt had been made to start a school but it had failed\nignominiously and a system of education was to be put into operation\nfrom the very start.\n\nThe Filipinos are not strong advocates of co-education, so separate\nschools were to be started for the boys and the girls. The one for the\nboys was gotten well in hand before the one for the girls was\nattempted at all.\n\nA few days after reaching the town and securing a home the\npresidente of the town had it publicly announced that the following\nMonday morning at eight o'clock a public school for boys would be\nopened in a building that had been rented for the purpose by the\nmunicipal council. About the middle of the afternoon of the same day a\nman beat a little drum throughout all the streets of the town to call\nthe people out and the town clerk announced both in Spanish and in the\nnative language that this public school would begin at the time and\nplace mentioned above; that instruction would be free to all who came;\nthat the government would furnish all supplies; and that instruction\nwould be given in the English language. A native principal and\nassistants were employed and everything was ready to begin.\n\nThe official report of the result is as follows:\n    Boys' public school of Talisay, Negros, P. I., began November\n    4, 1901. Forty-three boys present at eight o'clock. Forty-one\n    of them knew \"good morning\" and \"good afternoon\" but do not\n    know the distinction between them. Two of them speak simple\n    Spanish. At eight forty-five, eight more, who had been\n    attending an early morning private school, came in together.\n\n    The books they brought were so varied and so different from\n    one another that it seemed impossible to bring any reasonable\n    degree of order out of such a chaos, and so, after struggling\n    vainly for about a week with the problem, the superintendent\n    by one fell stroke removed everything in use and put in a\n    uniform system, and from that day on the English language has\n    been the basis of instruction in the public schools of\n    Talisay. The work was of necessity very slow at first, but by\n    the end of a year two schools were going nicely and a number\n    of the brightest boys and girls had made really excellent\n    progress.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER V. - A \"BAILE.\"\n\n\nNot long after the arrival of our party at Bacalod we received an\ninvitation to a \"baile\" given in our honor by the inhabitants of\nSilay, a town some ten or twelve miles up the northern coast and one\nnoted for its social life. The invitation was accepted with pleasure,\nand about the middle of the afternoon on the day appointed we were\nclad in the immaculate white of the tropics and steaming away up the\ncoast on board a launch sent for our conveyance. Twilight was still\nlingering on the path of day when we anchored just off shore at the\ntown. A row-boat containing the officials of the city came out to meet\nus and, in due season, we were ushered into a spacious drawing-room\nfilled almost to overflowing with the \u00e9lite of the town. The \u00e9lite of\ntowns in the Philippines speak Spanish, and, as only one or two of our\nparty could at that time boast of more than a formal acquaintance with\nthe Castilian tongue, the exchange of ideas that evening between us\nand the Filipinos was of necessity not very rapid.\n\nThe necessity of easy communication between us was rendered somewhat\nless indispensable by the announcement of supper as soon as we were\nrested from our trip. When we had taken our places at the table a\nyoung Filipino about twenty-five years of age arose and gave a lengthy\ntoast to the recent union of the Philippines with the United States.\n\nBut as we Americans were unable to scale the dizzy heights of his\nclimaxes or sink to the depths of his pathos, we forewent the\npleasures of his oratory and turned our attention to the savory odor\nof lamb, chicken, and roast pig that came slyly stealing up our\nnostrils to send us nerve dispatches about the gastronomic delights of\nour not far distant future.\n\nAt last the toast was ended and the world-wide soup ushered in a long\ntrain of things good to eat, served in a style better fitted to the\ndelights of the appetite than to the formalities of dinners, for, as\nsoon as the pleasant task of one dish was completed by any one, the\nnext was served him at once regardless of the progress made by the\nothers at the table.\n\nThe last course was dulce. The new-comers to the Philippines will\nnot be long in making the acquaintance of this dish, and at all\nmeetings, both public and private, where eatables are served, it\nperforms an important part. It is anything sweet, and it may vary all\nthe way from an india-rubber-like black mixture of cocoanut milk and\ndirty sugar to a really toothsome and respectable confection. No\nmatter of what materials a dish is composed, just so long as it is\nsweet, it is dulce.\n\nAfter paying our respects to this last course, we arose from the table\nand entered a great rectangular room from the center of whose ceiling\nhung a large glass chandelier, a mass of shimmering crystals. In the\nchairs around the room were the wealth, the youth, and the beauty of\nthe town.\n\nThe first and also the last number of every Filipino dance of any\nformality is the \"rigodon.\" The dancers are arranged in a square, or\nquadrangle according to the number participating, and are then led\nthrough a tangled maze of figures that so utterly bewilders the novice\nthat he sinks into his chair at the end of the dance wondering how it\nall came to pass.\n\nWe Americans breathed a sigh of relief when the \"rigodon\" ended, and\nmustered fresh courage for social conquests in the waltz that was now\nbreathing forth from the trembling strings. My companion in the first\ndance had been the young lady by whose side I had sat at dinner. But\nit now became necessary to search for another, so I prudently waited\nto see how partners were chosen, and made no mistake when a few\nmoments later I faced one of the most luscious looking se\u00f1oritas on\nthe opposite side of the room and offered her my arm. My eyes must\nhave told the story that my lips could not utter in Spanish, for she\nsmiled upon me sweetly, arose, and put her hand upon my shoulder. My\narm encircled her waist and I began to waltz. Unfortunately my\ncompanion did not follow, but began to hop up and down in a manner\nmost distressing. Supposing the attack to be only temporary, I paused\nand, much to my relief, she soon showed signs of recovery; and in the\ncourse of time she came to a standstill looking up into my face in an\ninquiring sort of way, apparently wondering why St. Vitus had not paid\nhis respects to me also. A second attempt to follow the music met with\nresults similar to the first, and during the third attempt, which\nseemed to be trembling on the verge of a failure, St. Vitus let go my\ncompanion and seized me with such vigor that she, who was small even\nfor a Filipino, was gathered up bodily and taken around the room at\nsuch a pace that her toes touched the floor only at far distant\nintervals.\n\nAt this point my devotion to the shrine of Terpsichore ceased from\nforce of circumstances and I seated myself in one of the most\ncomfortable chairs in sight that I might carry out a previously formed\nplan to study the Filipino somewhat critically as he appears in\nsociety.\n\nThe first thing that impressed me as the dancers passed up and down\nthe room was the flash of diamonds. Nearly every woman in the room had\non a brooch that flashed the colors of the rainbow at every turn.\n\nAlmost all of them wore one or more rings that showed up brilliantly\nunder the chandelier. Many of the men too, especially the young men,\nwore gems that appeared to be exquisite. A closer inspection showed\nthat some of the gems had flaws and others were of a poor color, but\nno one would have denied that, taken as a whole, it was a really\nbeautiful display.\n\nThe dress of the ladies was richly colored. Many of their skirts were\nof silk covered with hand embroidered flowers, and their filmy pina\nwaists and broad collar pieces were rich with needle-work. They all\nwore a kind of heelless velvet slipper, very common as a dress shoe in\nthe Philippines, or high-heeled patent leather shoes with neatly\nfitting black stockings.\n\nThe men were dressed in white coats and white pantaloons or black\ncoats and white pantaloons. White shirts and collars, together with\nall sorts and styles of cravats and low-cut patent leather shoes with\nhighly colored socks completed their dress.\n\nIt was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money;\nthat they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a\ntable loaded with good things was a fact to which all of us were\nenthusiastic witnesses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VI. - A SKETCH OF LIFE IN THE PHILIPPINES.\n\n\nHouse-keeping in the Philippines presents some interesting phases. Our\nclub of American officials decided to run a mess, so we employed a\ncook and a house boy, then each of us provided himself with a personal\nservant, making a total of six servants for four men--it takes about\nthis proportion of servants to live in any sort of comfort in the\nPhilippines--and launched ourselves boldly upon the sea of domestic\neconomy. But there were shoals ahead of us, for the question of\nregulating servants is one of no small importance in the Philippines,\nand one of its most disadvantageous features is the long chain of\ndependents that usually attends it.\n\nWe gave the cooks so much a day with which to buy supplies in the\nlocal market, for our own table, making him render a daily list of\nexpenditures, and a fixed amount besides to purchase rice and fish for\nhimself and the other servants. Of course, if they wished to vary\ntheir diet and get chicken and fresh pork, which could be had at far\ndistant intervals, it was wholly a matter of their option, but the\nallowance was made on the basis of so much rice and fish a day for\neach. This allowance was about fifteen cents a day in Spanish coin per\nservant.\n\nThus far all was well. We had agreed to give the cook eight dollars a\nmonth in Spanish money, thinking that good wages would procure good\nservice, but the visions of affluence that floated before him on such\nfloods of wealth were so alluring that they drew him from the kitchen\nto the cooler veranda. In less than a week he had employed an\nassistant at four dollars a month; in less than another week that\nassistant had employed him an assistant at two dollars a month; in\nless than another week that assistant to the assistant had employed\nhim an assistant at the princely salary of fifty cents a month; and\nfrom fear that the chain of dependents would end only by our having\nthe whole Filipino race attached to our culinary force, we broke up\nhouse-keeping and went boarding again, choosing that as the less of\nthe two evils.\n\nOur house furnishings were almost wholly Philippine. The table ware\nand the food on the table came from the ends of the earth. The knives\nand forks were made in Germany, the plates were manufactured in\nEngland, the glass ware and table cloth, in the United States. The\noatmeal and flour came from the United States also. The butter came\nfrom Australia, the rice from China, the salt from Russia, and the\nother eatables from sources about as various as their separate names.\n\nSwitzerland furnished the condensed milk and Illinois the canned\ncream. Nearly all of the canned fruit bore labels from Spain.\n\nThus it can easily be seen that life in the Philippines, if lived\naccording to American ideals, is dependent upon a highly developed and\nhighly complex commerce. However, the difficulties of transportation\nand the restriction of large stocks of merchandise to Manila and some\nhalf a dozen other towns, make so great a difference between country\nlife and city life that a short comparison of the two will not be out\nof place, and life in Manila may well be taken as being fairly typical\nof the latter.\n\nLife in Manila is pleasant, but expensive. It is pleasant from the\nfact that it is not only the capital but also metropolis of the\narchipelago. Thus the combination of wealth and high official position\nhas given to Manila a society of the highest and most refined type.\n\nThe process of beautifying and improving the city which is constantly\ngoing on bids fair to give us at no distant day a city of which we may\nwell be proud.\n\nBut let him who intends living well in Manila on a small income bid\nfarewell at once to so idylic a dream, for it costs much to live well\nthere. In the city of Manila one can get almost anything he wishes,\nbut it must be paid for at the price it commands. Especially in the\ncase of eatables, this price is by no means small, because to the\nfirst cost of articles must in most cases be added the expense of\ndistant shipment from American, European, or Australian ports, and not\ninfrequently the cost of long refrigeration must also be taken into\nconsideration. But, expensive though it is, it is very pleasant to\nlive there and those who have once enjoyed it often wish again to\nquaff the cup of its delights.\n\nIn strong contrast to this pleasant life is the life of the quiet\nlittle hamlet away in the distant islands. Indeed, the Filipino from\nthe distant town, who by some good fortune has been to Manila, or, by\na coup de main, has studied in one of the Manila colleges, is looked\nup to in a true hero-worshiping attitude by all who either know him or\nhear of his fame. Life in such a place is one long state of harmless\ninactivity. Not a wave of trouble from the great outer world ever\ndisturbs its peaceful repose. One lounges forever in an air of\nindolent ease and extreme aversion to anything approaching what might\nbe called a respectable effort.\n\nOne arises in the morning about the time the sun's first rays silver\nthe top leaves of the cocoanut trees and then stirs around until nine\nor ten o'clock, when it is found expedient to avoid a further exposure\nto the sun. From then until about five o'clock in the afternoon it is\nbest to take things as they come, even though one of those things be a\nFilipino dinner. But then you may have your vehiclo attached to a\nyoung bull with a ring in his nose and go for a drive. If it is the\ndry season you will probably enjoy the drive unless you object to the\nfrequent clouds of dust swept along by the evening wind. If it is in\nthe rainy season your pleasure will depend to a considerable extent\nupon how wet you get; but, whether the season be wet or dry, your\npleasure will be regulated largely by the state of harmony existing\nbetween the driver and the bull.\n\nIn these quiet secluded nooks successive generations of Filipinos are\nborn, reared, grow old and die in an even chain of events broken only\nby the occasional erection of a new grass house on the identical spot\nwhere its predecessors have stood for ages. The son lives in the house\nof his father, cultivates the same few square feet of soil planted in\nedible roots, climbs the same cocoanut trees, follows the same winding\npath down to the stream, pounds rice in the same mortar and with the\nsame stick that his ancestors have used from time unremembered, and,\nin case of illness, curls up on a grass mat in a corner of the room\nuntil he dies or by some good fortune recovers. Beyond this narrow\nhorizon he never looks. So narrow and contracted is the life that the\nlanguages of two towns a few miles apart are so different that one\nwould scarcely recognize them as belonging to the same race of people.\n\nSuch are the two extremes of life in our new far Eastern provinces:\nthe one is active, progressive, and cosmopolitan; the other, inactive,\ndecadent, and narrow; but, whether one enjoys the first or endures the\nsecond, there comes to him after leaving a longing to lounge again in\ntropic airs and listen to the lullaby of the winds among the palms.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VII. - THE FILIPINO AT HOME.\n\n\nAs one enters a Filipino sitting-room for the first time, there is one\nfeature in the arrangement of the furniture that impresses itself upon\nhim at once, and it may be stated without fear of serious\ncontradiction that this same peculiar feature in its arrangement will\ncontinue to face him, as he enters different homes, about as certainly\nas he crosses the threshold.\n\nThe arrangement referred to is that of one large mirror, one settee,\nand some ten or a dozen chairs that appear to have had a certain\norderly affection for one another. The mirror is hung upon one of the\nlarge interior parts of the house about four feet above the floor. The\nwooden houses in the Philippines are built by setting large posts\nupright into the ground, extending into the air from twenty to thirty\nfeet. Cross timbers are fastened to these upright posts about eight or\nten feet above the ground and then not sawed off even with the posts,\nbut allowed to extend beyond them each way. The framework of the house\nis built upon these extending cross timbers, a style of building by\nwhich these large upright posts are left standing out on the inside of\nthe room from one to three feet from the walls. It is on that one of\nthese posts most nearly opposite the door that the mirror always finds\nits place. Immediately beneath the mirror is the settee; and the\nchairs are arranged in two parallel lines facing one another and at\nright angles with the ends of the settee. However odd this arrangement\nmay appear to one when he first enters a Filipino drawing-room, there\nare two things to be said in its favor. In the first place, it places\nyou face to face with the person with whom you are conversing so that\nyou can watch him,--a matter of no small moment in the Philippines. In\nthe next place, it enables you to give one of the young ladies a\nsheep's-eye in the mirror while the others present are left where\nMoses was in our much abused conundrum.\n\nThe size of the residence and the quality of its furnishings depends\nupon the wealth of the owner. But there is so vast a difference\nbetween the mode of life of the highest class and the tao, or lowest\nclass, that it is well to speak of them separately, and the great\nmiddle class of Filipinos can easily be imagined to occupy the\nintervening ground.\n\nThe rich Filipino's house is usually of wood built upon a wall of\nstone or brick from ten to fifteen feet high. The floors are kept\nhighly polished in his hallway, dressing-room, and bed-rooms. There\nare, of course, no fire-places in any of the rooms, but on some\noccasions something is needed to dry the rain-soaked atmosphere, for\neven in the dry season it has been seen to rain for five successive\ndays and nights without the cessation of a moment.\n\nA long chain of dependents is attached to the household of the rich\nFilipino. The master has his special body servant to be present at all\ntimes to do his master's bidding, in short, to be the visible\nmechanism of his master's volition. So, too, the lady of the house has\nher servant woman to do the slightest bidding of her ladyship. Then\nthere is the cook who is almost invariably a man, a house boy or two,\nand the coachman. These functionaries, with their assistants and\nassistants to the assistants, together with a servant or two for the\nexclusive service of the children, complete the economic household.\n\nSuch a family has an abundance of rice and wheat bread, also of\nchicken and fish with occasional fresh beef. They have also a good\ndeal of dulce. They regularly serve wine and frequently serve beer\non their tables.\n\nIn strong contrast with this mode of life is that of the tao. His\ndiet consists almost wholly of rice and small uncleaned fish boiled\ntogether. As a rule knife, fork, plate, and spoon find no place in his\nhousehold. The rice and fish are boiled in a pot and then allowed to\ncool in the same vessel or poured out to cool in a large earthen or\nwooden bowl. Then Mr. Tao together with Mrs. Tao and all the young\nTaos squat on their heels around the mixture and satisfy that\nintangible thing called the appetite. They do not use chop sticks as\nthe Chinese do, but the rice and fish are caught in a hollow formed by\nthe first three fingers of the right hand. The thumb is then placed\nbehind the mass. It is raised up and poised before the mouth, with a\nskill coming from the evolution of ages, when a contraction of the\nmuscles of the thumb throws the mass into the mouth with a skill that\nis marvelous to any but a Filipino. To judge from the most reliable\ninformation, the poorest class do not have an abundance of food,\nalthough it would seem that such a condition of things would be\nwell-nigh impossible. However, in a census of one hundred school\nchildren there were found six boys and four girls who declared that\nthey had never had enough to eat, and the native teacher stated that\nthis was probably true.\n\nThe wide gulf between the tao and the rich man is filled by the\ngreat middle class of Filipinos.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VIII. - VISIT TO A LEPER COLONY.\n\n\nNot far from our town was a leper colony and the first Saturday that\ncould be spared was set aside for a trip to the place. It happened\nthat none of the other Americans were at leisure on this particular\nmorning, but, rather then delay the trip or miss it altogether, the\nwriter, armed with a revolver, started out alone.\n\nThe road had been described so accurately by one who was supposed to\nknow it that it was deemed well-nigh impossible to miss the way. The\nmain highway was followed to the point where the by-path supposed to\nlead to the settlement turned off through some bamboo thickets and a\nlow tropical wood. This path led straight away towards the sea-coast\nwhere the houses of the colony were said to stand in a cocoanut grove\nby the beach.\n\nUpon arriving at the settlement, a very inhospitable reception was\nreceived from a mangy cur that growled and showed a very uninviting\nset of sharp, white teeth behind his snarling lips. The growling of\nthe dog had attracted the attention of an old man who, with age-bent\nback, was pounding rice in a mortar about fifty yards away. He turned\nslowly around and, upon seeing an intruder into the primitive quiet of\nthe place, gave a sharp, far-reaching call. The sound had scarcely\nrung through the grove when from about a dozen of the little grass\nhouses dotted here and there fifteen or twenty men armed with bolos\ncame out and gathered around the old man. A sense of my danger flashed\nupon me. Three miles from town and alone in a tropical jungle, I could\nbe almost instantly overcome by this band of bolo-men, and the only\nreport that would ever reach my people would be that I had\n\"disappeared.\" Of course, attack was by no means certain, but the\npotentiality of the situation was thrilling. A drawn revolver and the\ngleaming of its shining barrel had the effect of stopping the men, who\nseemed to be hesitating as to a course of action, until a somewhat\ndignified retreat was made to an open space in the rear from where a\nless dignified and a more hasty retreat began which did not stop short\nof Bacalod.\n\nEnough had been seen, however, even in this short visit, to give\nconvincing proof that the settlement visited was no colony of lepers;\nso, that afternoon two servant boys being taken as guides and\ninterpreters, another attempt was made to reach the goal desired.\n\nThis attempt was successful, and, after about two hours of walking, a\nlittle cluster of grass huts snugly hidden by the sea-coast came into\nview. As we approached, one would have thought it a gala-day. Some few\nchildren, apparently from six to thirteen years of age, almost wholly\nnude, were romping and playing in the open space around which the huts\nstood, and no one would ever have thought that any cloud so horrible\nas leprosy could hover over a place apparently so happy.\n\nBy the side of the path as we passed was a man and his wife setting\nout potato plants. His hands were so puffed and his fingers so short\nthat he could scarcely use them, but he was working along as best he\ncould. His wife's feet were so swollen and twisted that she walked\nonly with the greatest difficulty. We passed them by and entered the\nopen space above referred to.\n\nThe children now saw us, and those of them who could darted away like\nfrightened rabbits, each to his own burrow. An old man who was sitting\nin the warm afternoon sun on the little bamboo platform before his hut\nwas aroused from his lethargic repose by the scampering away of the\nchildren. He arose, trembling upon his tottering limbs, all drawn and\ntwisted, and hobbled away into his hut.\n\nThe children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at\nthe doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of\nthe settlement. In a few moments we were surrounded by a circle of\nhuman beings at once so repulsive and so pitiable that its graphic\nvividness can never be accurately portrayed.\n\nThe old man referred to above, having put on a pair of snow-white\npantaloons, appeared now at the doorway of his hut, followed a few\nmoments later by his wife who had evidently clothed herself in the\nbest raiment she had. At a call from the old man, all the men, women,\nand children in the settlement came out of their huts and stood in a\nline before us. The old man was spokesman and in his native visayan\ntongue made a heart-rending appeal for aid which we were powerless to\ngive. Attention was called to a leper woman, apparently about\ntwenty-five years of age, whose face had been attacked by the disease\nand whose appearance was truly pathetic. Upon her hip was a child\nabout a year and a half old and, strange to say, the child showed as\nyet no signs whatever of the disease.\n\nWhat an indissoluble enigma is life! Here in a little cluster of grass\nhuts in a secluded nook of a secluded island of an all but secluded\narchipelago was gathered together a little community of wretched\nnatives, driven by their loathsomeness from association with others\neven of the same half-savage race. Yet here, men and women loved and\nwere married, by mutual trust if not by law, and children were born of\nthe union to live forever under the unspeakable horror that\novershadowed the unfortunate parents. Love, hatred, sorrow, and\njoy--every passion that enters into the complex structure of the human\nheart even here, in this scene of sadness and despair, was playing\napparently as freely as where misfortune and disease had never crossed\nthe portals of life.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER IX. - A \"HIKE.\"\n\n\nWe were lounging lazily in our hammocks at Jimamaylan one evening in\nApril. Supper was just ended, and the soldiers in the post were\ncollected in groups here and there spinning yarns to pass away the\ntime, when a Filipino clad only in a loin cloth came down the street\nat a steadily swinging run and stopped in front of the sentry. He\nbrought the announcement that a band of ladrones had just burned a\nsugar mill and were advancing to sack a barrio about fifteen miles\naway.\n\nThe invitation of the commanding officer to go on a \"hike\" was eagerly\naccepted, and, in ten minutes after the message was given, the troops\nwere on the march followed by two adventurous pedagogues.\n\nDarkness was just closing in as we left the town, but a resplendent\ntropic moon soon made the night almost as brilliant as the day. The\ntrail we followed led over rough and rocky country. Sometimes for a\ndistance of a mile or more we passed over barren wastes of volcanic\nslag poured out in anger by some peak whose convulsions have long\nsince ceased. Again we would descend into a tropical jungle from the\ndense foliage of which the ladrones could have leaped at any moment,\nhad they known of our coming, and annihilated our little band. We\nforded rapid streams with the water at our breasts, and halted only\nonce in that rapid march of fifteen miles.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the town we met a man who was standing\nguard against a surprise by the ladrones. Nothing could well have been\nmuch more grotesque and nothing could much better illustrate the\nabsolutely primitive condition of the Filipinos in the interior of the\nislands than the appearance of this guard. A pair of knee pants, a\nconical grass hat, and a hemp shirt formed his entire apparel. A long\nflat wooden shield, a bolo, and a long bamboo spear with a sharp,\nflat, iron point, completed his equipment for battle.\n\nHere stood the first and the twentieth centuries side by side. The\nFilipino who had advanced only a stage beyond the condition of\nprimitive man with his knife, spear, and wooden shield, stood side by\nside with the American soldier, a representative of modern life with\nhis magazine rifle, his canteen, his knapsack,--with every article of\nhis clothing made to give him the highest possible efficiency as the\nunit of a military organization.\n\nA few yards farther on we met another guard equipped similarly to the\nfirst. Upon reaching the town, news had just been received that a\ndetachment of troops from another post had intercepted the ladrones\nand fought a skirmish with them. The ladrones had escaped and we set\nout in pursuit of them on a chase wilder than a Quixotic dream. We\nwound our way into the mountains behind the town, inquiring at every\ngrass hut we passed whether the band of ladrones had passed that way,\nbut only once was even a trace of them found. Then it was learned that\nat a certain place they had separated into groups of three or four and\ngone glimmering through the dream of things that were. This place was\nin a secluded nook of the mountains where in years gone by some\nadventurous Spaniard had erected a primitive water mill to grind his\nsugar-cane. We had now marched about twenty miles and the feet of the\npedagogues were a mass of blisters. They had reached the point where\nthat form of military maneuvering called \"hiking\" ceased to possess\nany alluring charms. So a native was persuaded to come out of his lone\nmountain hut and hitch up his carabao and cart. He was then made to\nget on the carabao's back, while the aforesaid pedagogues lay down on\nthe sugar-cane pulp that had been put into the body of the cart, and\nthe driver was instructed to start for the post we had left hours\nbefore, and not to stop until he got there. Being uncertain but that\nsome of the ladrones would learn of our having left the body of troops\nand would try the metal of our steel, we at first agreed that neither\nof us should go to sleep, but it was later decided that probably the\ndriver had no greater desire to cross the Styx than his passengers had\nand that in case of danger he would awaken us, so both took a revolver\nin each hand, stretched out supinely and went to sleep.\n\nSuch a sleep! The rough jolting of the cart over an almost impassable\nroad was never enough to break the spell of slumber. When we awoke the\nblazing tropic sun was past the midday mark of morning, shining full\ninto our unprotected and well-nigh blistered faces.\n\nA pack of dogs were heralding our approach to a little village at the\nfoot of the mountains where ponies were procured to take us back to\nthe post."

                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently\nno time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth dimension of Space\nas a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house\nbecame quite quiet.\n\nOn reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up\nagainst a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realize\nhis position. Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\nhundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the\nDowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone\ninto hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains on\none of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who\nhad been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr\nto nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair\nby the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six\nweeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become\nreconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that\nnotorious sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible\nnight when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his\ndressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and\nconfessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox\nout of \u00a350,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card, and swore that\nthe ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back\nto him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because\nhe had seen a green hand tapping at the window-pane, to the beautiful\nLady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round\nher throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin,\nand who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of the\nKing's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he went\nover his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as\nhe recalled to mind his last appearance as \"Red Reuben, or the Strangled\nBabe,\" his d\u00e9but as \"Guant Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,\"\n\nand the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely\nplaying ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And\nafter all this some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him\nthe Rising Sun Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite\nunbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever been treated in this\nmanner. Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance, and remained till\ndaylight in an attitude of deep thought.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III\n\n\nThe next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed\nthe ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. \"I have\nno wish,\" he said, \"to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say\nthat, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,\"--a very just remark,\nat which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.\n\n\"Upon the other hand,\" he continued, \"if he really declines to use the\nRising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him. It\nwould be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside\nthe bedrooms.\"\n\nFor the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the\nblood-stain on the library floor. This certainly was very strange, as\nthe door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept\nclosely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a\ngood deal of comment. Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red,\nthen it would be vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came\ndown for family prayers, according to the simple rites of the Free\nAmerican Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright\nemerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party\nvery much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening. The\nonly person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia, who,\nfor some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the\nsight of the blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was\nemerald-green.\n\nThe second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in\nthe hall. Rushing down-stairs, they found that a large suit of old\narmour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone\nfloor, while seated in a high-backed chair was the Canterville ghost,\nrubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face. The\ntwins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged\ntwo pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained\nby long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United\nStates Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in\naccordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost\nstarted up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a\nmist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so\nleaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase\nhe recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of\ndemoniac laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely\nuseful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single\nnight, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French\ngovernesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly\nlaughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and\nrang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door\nopened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown. \"I am\nafraid you are far from well,\" she said, \"and have brought you a bottle\nof Doctor Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a\nmost excellent remedy.\" The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at\nonce to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an\naccomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family\ndoctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's\nuncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps,\nhowever, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself\nwith becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep\nchurchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.\n\nOn reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the\nmost violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross\nmaterialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what\nreally distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit\nof mail. He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by\nthe sight of a Spectre in armour, if for no more sensible reason, at\nleast out of respect for their natural poet Longfellow, over whose\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\nhour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides it was his own suit.\n\nHe had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament, and had\nbeen highly complimented on it by no less a person than the Virgin Queen\nherself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely overpowered\nby the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen\nheavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees severely, and\nbruising the knuckles of his right hand.\n\nFor some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of\nhis room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.\n\nHowever, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to\nmake a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his\nfamily. He selected Friday, August 17th, for his appearance, and spent\nmost of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in\nfavour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet\nfrilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards evening a\nviolent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was\njust such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to\nmake his way quietly to Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the\nfoot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\nof low music. He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville\nblood-stain by means of Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent. Having reduced\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and\nhis wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead,\nwhile he hissed into her trembling husband's ear the awful secrets of\nthe charnel-house. With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made\nup his mind. She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and\ngentle. A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more\nthan sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the\ncounterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins, he was quite\ndetermined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be done was, of\ncourse, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling\nsensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each\nother, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse,\ntill they became paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw off the\nwinding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white, bleached bones and\none rolling eyeball, in the character of \"Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's\nSkeleton,\" a r\u00f4le in which he had on more than one occasion produced a\ngreat effect, and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of\n\"Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.\"\n\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the\nlight-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves\nbefore they retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still,\nand, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the\nwindow-panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family\nslept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\ncould hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States. He\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his\nmurdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like\nan evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.\n\nOnce he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only\nthe baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange\nsixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\nin the midnight air. Finally he reached the corner of the passage that\nled to luckless Washington's room. For a moment he paused there, the\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's\nshroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was\ncome. He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had\nhe done so than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid\nhis blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was\nstanding a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous\nas a madman's dream! Its head was bald and burnished; its face round,\nand fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\nfeatures into an eternal grin. From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\nlight, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like\nto his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form. On its breast\nwas a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of\nshame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime,\nand, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\n\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's\njack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler. Once in the\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small\npallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes. After a time, however,\nthe brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to\ngo and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight. Accordingly,\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling\nthat, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid\nof his new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins. On reaching\nthe spot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had\nevidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from\nits hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it\nwas leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable\nattitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his\nhorror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a\nrecumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity\nbed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow\nturnip lying at his feet! Unable to understand this curious\ntransformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there,\nin the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:--\n        +------------------------------------+\n        |         YE OTIS GHOSTE             |\n        | Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook, |\n        |    Beware of Ye Imitationes.       |\n        |   All others are counterfeite.     |\n        +------------------------------------+\nThe whole thing flashed across him. He had been tricked, foiled, and\nout-witted! The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his\ntoothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his\nhead, swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\nschool, that, when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds\nof blood would be wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.\n\nHardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of\na distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh,\nand waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\nreason, did not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back\nto his room, thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose. There he\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was\nexceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which this oath\nhad been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second time. \"Perdition\nseize the naughty fowl,\" he muttered, \"I have seen the day when, with my\nstout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow\nfor me an 'twere in death!\" He then retired to a comfortable lead\ncoffin, and stayed there till evening.\n\n\nCHAPTER: IV\n\n\nThe next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were\ncompletely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five\ndays he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point\nof the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want\nit, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a\nlow, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating\nthe symbolic value of sensuous phenomena. The question of phantasmic\napparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a\ndifferent matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large\noriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every month, and he\ndid not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is\nquite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand,\nhe was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.\n\nFor the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as\nusual between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible\nprecaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots,\ntrod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large\nblack velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for\noiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good\ndeal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of\nprotection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he\nslipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a\nlittle humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see\nthat there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a\ncertain degree, it served his purpose. Still in spite of everything he\nwas not left unmolested. Strings were continually being stretched across\nthe corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion,\nwhile dressed for the part of \"Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley\nWoods,\" he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide,\nwhich the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry\nChamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged\nhim, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and\nsocial position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the\nnext night in his celebrated character of \"Reckless Rupert, or the\nHeadless Earl.\"\n\nHe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in\nfact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means\nof it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord\nCanterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome\nJack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\ndown the terrace at twilight. Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\nLord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken\nheart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it\nhad been a great success. It was, however an extremely difficult\n\"make-up,\" if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more\nscientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three\nhours to make his preparations. At last everything was ready, and he was\nvery pleased with his appearance. The big leather riding-boots that went\nwith the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\nfind one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite\nsatisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting\nand crept down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins,\nwhich I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of\nthe colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make\nan effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water\nfell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his\nleft shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed. The shock to his\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\ncould go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold. The only\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\nhad not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences\nmight have been very serious.\n\nHe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,\nand contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in\nlist slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\ndraughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the\ntwins. The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September. He\nhad gone down-stairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that\nthere, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing\nhimself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of\nthe United States Minister and his wife which had now taken the place of\nthe Canterville family pictures. He was simply but neatly clad in a long\nshroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip\nof yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In\nfact, he was dressed for the character of \"Jonas the Graveless, or the\nCorpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,\" one of his most remarkable\nimpersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to\nremember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their\nneighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a quarter-past two o'clock in\nthe morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring. As\nhe was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any\ntraces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a\ndark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads,\nand shrieked out \"BOO!\" in his ear.\n\nSeized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural,\nhe rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him\nthere with the big garden-syringe, and being thus hemmed in by his\nenemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the\ngreat iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to\nmake his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own\nroom in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.\n\nAfter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins\nlay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\nservants, but it was of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings\nwere so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed\nhis great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had\nbeen engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized a wonderful\nclam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse\neuchre, poker, and other American national games, and Virginia rode\nabout the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire,\nwho had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville\nChase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in\nfact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who,\nin reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best\ncongratulations to the Minister's worthy wife.\n\nThe Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the\nhouse, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let\nmatters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the\nyoung Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had\nonce bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice\nwith the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the\nfloor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state that, though\nhe lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but\n\"Double Sixes.\" The story was well known at the time, though, of course,\nout of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt\nwas made to hush it up, and a full account of all the circumstances\nconnected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle's\nRecollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends. The ghost, then,\nwas naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence\nover the Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his\nown first cousin having been married en secondes noces to the Sieur de\nBulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are\nlineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to\nVirginia's little lover in his celebrated impersonation of \"The Vampire\nMonk, or the Bloodless Benedictine,\" a performance so horrible that when\nold Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in\nthe year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which\nculminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after\ndisinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and\nleaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment,\nhowever, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the\nlittle Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal\nBedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.\n\n\nCHAPTER: V\n\n\nA few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out\nriding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting\nthrough a hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go\nup by the back staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past\nthe Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied\nshe saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother's maid, who\nsometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend\nher habit. To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville\nGhost himself! He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of\nthe yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing\nmadly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his hand, and his\nwhole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so forlorn, and so\nmuch out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea\nhad been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity,\nand determined to try and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so\ndeep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she\nspoke to him.\n\n\"I am so sorry for you,\" she said, \"but my brothers are going back to\nEton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy\nyou.\"\n\n\"It is absurd asking me to behave myself,\" he answered, looking round in\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,\n\"quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and\nwalk about at night, if that is what you mean. It is my only reason for\nexisting.\"\n\n\"It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very\nwicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had\nkilled your wife.\"\n\n\"Well, I quite admit it,\" said the Ghost, petulantly, \"but it was a\npurely family matter, and concerned no one else.\"\n\n\"It is very wrong to kill any one,\" said Virginia, who at times had a\nsweet puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.\n\n\"Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very\nplain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about\ncookery. Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent\npricket, and do you know how she had it sent to table? However, it is\nno matter now, for it is all over, and I don't think it was very nice of\nher brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.\"\n\n\"Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost--I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry? I\nhave a sandwich in my case. Would you like it?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you,\nall the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\nvulgar, dishonest family.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Virginia, stamping her foot, \"it is you who are rude, and\nhorrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the\npaints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain\nin the library. First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and\nI couldn't do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the\nchrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese\nwhite, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing\nto look at, and not at all easy to paint. I never told on you, though I\nwas very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for\nwho ever heard of emerald-green blood?\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" said the Ghost, rather meekly, \"what was I to do? It is\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother\nbegan it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I\nshould not have your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of\ntaste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest\nin England; but I know you Americans don't care for things of this\nkind.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\nand improve your mind. My father will be only too happy to give you a\nfree passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind,\nthere will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are\nall Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\nhave a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family ghost.\"\n\n\"I don't think I should like America.\"\n\n\"I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,\" said Virginia,\nsatirically.\n\n\"No ruins! no curiosities!\" answered the Ghost; \"you have your navy and\nyour manners.\"\n\n\"Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week's\nholiday.\"\n\n\"Please don't go, Miss Virginia,\" he cried; \"I am so lonely and so\nunhappy, and I really don't know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I\ncannot.\"\n\n\"That's quite absurd! You have merely to go to bed and blow out the\ncandle. It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\nchurch, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why, even\nbabies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.\"\n\n\"I have not slept for three hundred years,\" he said sadly, and\nVirginia's beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; \"for three hundred\nyears I have not slept, and I am so tired.\"\n\nVirginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like\nrose-leaves. She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked\nup into his old withered face.\n\n\"Poor, poor Ghost,\" she murmured; \"have you no place where you can\nsleep?\"\n\n\"Far away beyond the pine-woods,\" he answered, in a low, dreamy voice,\n\"there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\nsings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold crystal\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\nsleepers.\"\n\nVirginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\n\n\"You mean the Garden of Death,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth,\nwith the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have\nno yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at\npeace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of death's\nhouse, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death\nis.\"\n\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\nthere was silence. She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\n\nThen the ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of\nthe wind.\n\n\"Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?\"\n\n\"Oh, often,\" cried the little girl, looking up; \"I know it quite well.\n\nIt is painted in curious black letters, and is difficult to read. There\nare only six lines:\n    \"'When a golden girl can win\n    Prayer from out the lips of sin,\n    When the barren almond bears,\n    And a little child gives away its tears,\n    Then shall all the house be still\n    And peace come to Canterville.'\n\n\"But I don't know what they mean.\"\n\n\"They mean,\" he said, sadly, \"that you must weep with me for my sins,\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle,\nthe angel of death will have mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\ncannot prevail.\"\n\nVirginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair\nas he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes. \"I am not afraid,\" she said\nfirmly, \"and I will ask the angel to have mercy on you.\"\n\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as\nhe led her across the dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were\nbroidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back. \"Go back! little Virginia,\"\n\nthey cried, \"go back!\" but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly,\nand she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails\nand goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and\nmurmured, \"Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,\"\n\nbut the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When\nthey reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she\ncould not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly\nfading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A\nbitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her\ndress. \"Quick, quick,\" cried the Ghost, \"or it will be too late,\" and\nin a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry\nChamber was empty.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VI\n\n\nAbout ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not\ncome down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia\nanywhere. As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\nevening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all\nalarmed at first, but when six o'clock struck, and Virginia did not\nappear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for\nher, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house. At\nhalf-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\nof their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of\nexcitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly\nremembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies\npermission to camp in the park. He accordingly at once set off for\nBlackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son\nand two of the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire, who was\nperfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too,\nbut Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a\nscuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gipsies had\ngone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as\nthe fire was still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.\n\nHaving sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran\nhome, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the\ncounty, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been\nkidnapped by tramps or gipsies. He then ordered his horse to be brought\nround, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down\nto dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with a groom. He had hardly,\nhowever, gone a couple of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after\nhim, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with\nhis face very flushed, and no hat. \"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,\" gasped\nout the boy, \"but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.\n\nPlease don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year,\nthere would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me back,\nwill you? I can't go! I won't go!\"\n\nThe Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace,\nand was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down\nfrom his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, \"Well,\nCecil, if you won't go back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must\nget you a hat at Ascot.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!\" cried the little Duke, laughing,\nand they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of\nthe station-master if any one answering to the description of Virginia\nhad been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her. The\nstation-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him\nthat a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a\nhat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his\nshutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away,\nwhich he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as there was a\nlarge common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman, but\ncould get no information from him, and, after riding all over the\ncommon, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase\nabout eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found\nWashington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with\nlanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest trace of\nVirginia had been discovered. The gipsies had been caught on Brockley\nmeadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they should be late. Indeed, they had\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's disappearance, as they\nwere very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his\npark, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search.\n\nThe carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone\nover, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any\nrate, Virginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest\ndepression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they\nfound a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\nwas poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and\nhaving her forehead bathed with eau de cologne by the old housekeeper.\n\nMr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up\nsupper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one\nspoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very\nfond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the\nentreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that\nnothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in\nthe morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down\nimmediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight\nbegan to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded\nthey heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder\nshook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a\npanel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out\non the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her\nhand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs.\nOtis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with\nviolent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.\n\n\"Good heavens! child, where have you been?\" said Mr. Otis, rather\nangrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them.\n\n\"Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and\nyour mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these\npractical jokes any more.\"\n\n\"Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!\" shrieked the twins, as they\ncapered about.\n\n\"My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side\nagain,\" murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair.\n\n\"Papa,\" said Virginia, quietly, \"I have been with the Ghost. He is dead,\nand you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was\nreally sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of\nbeautiful jewels before he died.\"\n\nThe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave\nand serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a\nlighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they\ncame to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia\ntouched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves\nin a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated\nwindow. Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was\na gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone\nfloor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers\nan old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its\nreach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was\ncovered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but\na pile of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding\nher little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the\nparty looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\ndisclosed to them.\n\n\"Hallo!\" suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out\nof the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\nsituated. \"Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.\"\n\n\"God has forgiven him,\" said Virginia, gravely, as she rose to her feet,\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.\n\n\"What an angel you are!\" cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round\nher neck, and kissed her.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VII\n\n\nFour days after these curious incidents, a funeral started from\nCanterville Chase at about eleven o'clock at night. The hearse was drawn\nby eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\nnodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\npurple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville\ncoat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\nservants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully\nimpressive. Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up\nspecially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first\ncarriage along with little Virginia. Then came the United States\nMinister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the\nlast carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had\nbeen frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she\nhad a right to see the last of him. A deep grave had been dug in the\ncorner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service\nwas read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, the servants, according to an old custom\nobserved in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as\nthe coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward,\nand laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms. As\nshe did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its\nsilent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a\nnightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of the\nGarden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a\nword during the drive home.\n\nThe next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given\nto Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby\nnecklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen\nof sixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis\nfelt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"I know that in this country mortmain is held to\napply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that\nthese jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg\nyou, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you\nunder certain strange conditions. As for my daughter, she is merely a\nchild, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such\nappurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I\nmay say, is no mean authority upon Art,--having had the privilege of\nspending several winters in Boston when she was a girl,--that these gems\nare of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\nprice. Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you\nwill recognize how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\nin the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such\nvain gauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\nBritish aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who\nhave been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles\nof Republican simplicity. Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box, as a memento of\nyour unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is extremely old, and\nconsequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to\ncomply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good deal\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with medi\u00e6valism\nin any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was\nborn in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned\nfrom a trip to Athens.\"\n\nLord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister's speech,\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile,\nand when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\nsaid: \"My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky\nancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are\nmuch indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck. The jewels\nare clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough\nto take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave\nin a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. As for their being\nheirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or\nlegal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite\nunknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and\nwhen Miss Virginia grows up, I dare say she will be pleased to have\npretty things to wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the\nfurniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to\nthe ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity\nSir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he\nwas really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase.\"\n\nMr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville's refusal, and\nbegged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was\nquite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to\nretain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of\n1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's first\ndrawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the\nuniversal theme of admiration. For Virginia received the coronet, which\nis the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her\nboy-lover as soon as he came of age. They were both so charming, and\nthey loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the\nmatch, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch\nthe Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less\nthan three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to\nsay, Mr. Otis himself. Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke\npersonally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his\nown words, \"was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating\ninfluences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of\nRepublican simplicity should be forgotten.\" His objections, however,\nwere completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the\naisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his\narm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of\nEngland.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to\nCanterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over\nin the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods. There had\nbeen a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir\nSimon's tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it\nsimply the initials of the old gentleman's name, and the verse from the\nlibrary window. The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses,\nwhich she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for\nsome time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There\nthe Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her\nfeet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly\nhe threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her,\n\"Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.\"\n\n\"Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have,\" he answered, smiling, \"you have never told me what\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.\"\n\n\"I have never told any one, Cecil,\" said Virginia, gravely.\n\n\"I know that, but you might tell me.\"\n\n\"Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you. Poor Sir Simon! I owe\nhim a great deal. Yes, don't laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see\nwhat Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than\nboth.\"\n\nThe Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.\n\n\"You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,\" he murmured.\n\n\"You have always had that, Cecil.\"\n\n\"And you will tell our children some day, won't you?\"\n\nVirginia blushed.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.\n\nYet Millet would have us understand that in spite of this, the\nshepherd is performing a duty to humanity not to be underrated. The\nsheep he has so carefully and conscientiously reared will form food\nto-morrow for many a hungry town-dweller. Further, he would have us\nfollow the peasant as he closes the pen for the night and traces his\ntired steps towards his simple home in the village. The frugal and\nhard-earned meal, prepared for him by his wife, who like himself has\nhad her share of duties to occupy her during the day, is partaken of\nsurrounded by a hungry and joyous group of children. Such themes\nsuggested by the simplicity of his own life appealed to him with\nirresistible force, and it is in their portrayal that his greatness is\nmanifested.\n\nPerhaps no season of the year presented the same attraction for Millet\nas the spring. The period when all the earth after its long winter\nsleep is about to waken into new life seems to have always been a\nsource of inspiration to him. In \"The Sower\" he emphasises the fact\nthat the fruits of the harvest are not to be had without due labour\nbeing expended upon the earth. The sloping field, barren of\nvegetation, and crowned at the top with a small clump of trees, is\nbeing broken up by the distant plough drawn by two horses and guided\nby a peasant. The latter figure is one of the noblest of Millet's\ncreations. By his strained and ever-attentive attitude, by his\ncontinuous tramp over the rough and broken ground, he shows us the\nmonotony of his toil. He crosses the field in one direction, only to\nreturn at an interval of a few feet. In the foreground we have the\nsower, a middle-aged man of typical peasant type, on whose left side a\nbag of seeds is slung. With automatic precision he withdraws a\nhandful, and strews it into the furrows open to receive it. So long as\nhe continues in the same track his labour will be well performed, and\nhence his task is just as monotonous as that of his fellow-worker\nhigher up in the field. The silhouetting of these two figures against\nthe light is symbolical of the labour to be expended in life before\nresults are forthcoming.\n\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that in considering the works of\nMillet, one must not judge him from the standpoint of a mere painter.\n\nHis brush is only the means to an end, and by its means he is enabled\nto bring the fruits of his philosophic observation before us in\npermanent form. It has been charged against the \"Angelus\" that it was\nnot a remarkably fine piece of painting, that many a young artist of\nthe present generation is infinitely better equipped, technically\nspeaking, than the master who wrought this celebrated canvas. This may\nin a measure be true, but it must never be forgotten that Millet\nbrought into play exactly the means which could illustrate his meaning\nin the clearest terms. He had not intended, in painting such a\npicture, to produce a work which would astonish his fellow artists\nwith its brilliancy of handling or magnificence of colour. He wanted\nto make the beholder forget the painter and absorb the lesson. This\nquality runs right through the art of Millet, and it is from this\nstandpoint that we are obliged to weigh his merits.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE\n\n\nJean Fran\u00e7ois Millet was born on October 4, 1814, that is at the\nperiod when French art, at any rate as far as landscape painting is\nconcerned, had reached its lowest ebb. Throughout the eighteenth\ncentury the landscape painter had been hard put to make a living. The\ntaste of connoisseurs throughout the century had been for portraits\nand interiors, or for those numerous pastoral subjects which were\ncarried out with so much decorative charm by such men as Watteau and\nBoucher. Such landscape painting as existed was of the type\npopularised by Vernet; it was built upon a curious mixture of Italian\ninfluence coming from Panini and Salvator Rosa. The only evidence of\nrevolt against such a state of affairs we find in the works of Hubert\nRobert and Moreau. These two, and more especially would I direct the\nreader's attention to the latter, struggled hard to break down the\nconventionalities of the time. They endeavoured to infuse some sense\nof atmosphere into their pictures, and whilst frequently their trees\nand figures are painfully formal, they yet stand alone in the French\nschool as the pioneers of a phase of art which was to attain its\nzenith in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBut after the Revolution, and during the whole of the time that France\nwas under the domination of Napoleon, very rigid principles indeed\nwere enforced with regard to the direction that art should take. The\ninnovation which had its commencement in the reign of Louis XVI. swept\neverything before it as it gained force. Classical art and traditions\ndominated the whole French school, and no artist, however great his\nreputation, attempted for many years to swim against the stream. In\nspite of the principles of liberty and equality which were claimed for\nall under the new r\u00e9gime, a terribly strict eye was kept upon any\ninnovations which might break out in the form of a naturalistic art.\n\nThe directors of this new movement failed to see that the conditions\nwhich had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed\naway, and that the latter's supremacy was due to the fact that their\nproductions were symbolical of the loftiest thoughts of their own\nepoch. The art which expresses the ambitions and noblest thoughts of\nits time will alone endure. These expressions are not applicable to\nany other condition than those which called them forth, and hence in\nattempting to purify the rococo which had existed up to the middle of\nthe eighteenth century, by a return to classical traditions, they were\nonly copying that which their predecessors had done, and in so doing\nleft us without any original expression of their own time.\n\nInto such a condition of affairs was Millet born, and he was numbered\namongst that little band of men which included Rousseau, Corot, Dupr\u00e9,\nDiaz, and Daumier, who were to lay the foundations of the modern\nnaturalistic school. At the outset it was seemingly a hopeless\nstruggle they undertook; a struggle against prejudice and influence\nwhich was only to be brought to a victorious culmination after years\nof struggle and disappointment. Of this little band, Millet was\nperhaps the best equipped for the privations which were necessary. He\ncame of a peasant stock who inhabited Gruchy, a small village\nsituated in the commune of Gr\u00e9ville, close to Cherbourg. Grouped\nunderneath the humble roof was the grandmother, who had been left a\nwidow fifteen years before; her son, Jean Louis Nicolas Millet, and\nhis wife and eight children, of which our artist was the second. His\ngrandmother appears to have been a pious old lady, whose chief delight\nwas in her grandchildren, to whom she taught those religious\nprinciples which stood them in good stead in after life. We are told\nthat Millet's father possessed a force of character one does not often\nfind amongst men in his rank of life. He was of a contemplative\ndisposition, and had a keenly developed feeling for natural beauty. He\npossessed moreover a keen appreciation of music, which unfortunately\nhe does not appear to have had much opportunity of cultivating. His\nwife was an excellent housewife and of a religious turn of mind. The\nhouse they occupied, situated quite a short distance from the sea, was\nplaced in a tract of country which, whilst it had rugged and\npicturesque features, was not of a nature which would yield\nextraordinary results under cultivation. It was, therefore, a hard\nstruggle for existence which Millet in his first years saw going\non around him. Not that the family were any the less happy for having\nto work laboriously for their livelihood. They had been brought up\namidst such surroundings; their wants were simple and easily\ngratified, and the tranquillity of the m\u00e9nage more than\ncounterbalanced those doubtful luxuries which easier circumstances\nwould have brought their way. Throughout his life Millet maintained\nthe extreme simplicity he had seen practised in the home of his\nchildhood, and long years afterwards he was accustomed to look back\nwith pleasureable memories upon his early years.\n\nGruchy, situated in one of the wildest parts of Normandy, feels the\nfull effect of every storm which blows up from the Atlantic. There is\nnothing to shelter the exposed hamlets studded along the coast from\nthe fury of the western gale, and the rocks are but too often strewn\nwith the wrecks of vessels which have come to grief in that terrible\nsea. Millet in his youth must have witnessed many of these\ncatastrophes. Quite a number of drawings by him are extant\nrepresenting succour being extended to some vessel in difficulties, or\nthe hauling up of some wreckage on to the rocks. The studious boy\nmust have been impressed as he saw the sternness of the combat in his\nnative country between men and nature; the wind-swept fields, and\nhills bare to the point of savageness. The very trees themselves\ndwarfed and gnarled; in their struggle with the elements they have\nbeen made tough and hardy as the inhabitants of the country\nthemselves, and, stunted as they are, yet show well that they can\nresist the force of the fiercest storm. The brooding and contemplative\ncharacter of the father having descended to the son, we can quite\nimagine the effect such surroundings would have upon him. As he looked\nback in after years upon his roamings in his native country, he\nappreciated the awe-inspiring character of the scenery in which he had\nbeen born. He would doubtless recall many a walk amidst the fields\nwith the wind blowing in his face as it rushed in from the Atlantic,\nthe rain beating hard upon the freshly ploughed fields, and the\ndistant figure of the ploughman struggling hard with his team against\nthe stiff sou'wester. The great mass of vapour overhead whirled before\nthe violence of the storm, casting grey and pearly light over the\nwhole scene, whilst far away on the top of the hill a clump of trees,\nbent with their resistance to the wind, are silhouetted against the\nsky. Many a drawing of this kind we encounter in the later work of\nMillet, which shows how his thoughts harked back in certain moments to\nthe scenes he had left behind him for ever.\n\nWe know that on one or two occasions he returned to Gruchy. Once or\ntwice he had urgent business which took him back, but sometimes he\nwent with no other purpose than to renew acquaintance with the scenes\nof yore.\n\nLittle Jean Fran\u00e7ois was his grandmother's favourite. It was she who\ntaught him the names of things which surrounded him, and perhaps\ndirected his thoughts in the channels to which they were finally to be\ndevoted. Her brother Charles, who formed one of the family, used to\ntake him for walks, telling him stories on the way. Millet was\ndevotedly attached to this old man, and when at the age of seven years\nhe lost him, the gap in his life thus left made an impression upon his\nmemory never to be effaced.\n\nFive years afterwards he was placed in the hands of the vicar for the\npurpose of preparing him for his first communion. The good man seems\nto have been taken with the child; he found him so attentive to all\nnatural phenomenon which was passing around him and intelligent in an\nunusual degree. He quickly learnt a considerable amount of Latin,\nwhich introduced him to the great classics. Unfortunately for Millet,\nthe vicar accepted an offer of transference to a better parish in the\nvicinity. The boy had made such progress with his master that it was\ndecided that he should go with him to his new abode. He was, however,\nso missed in his own home, that when he came back for his first\nholidays it was decided that he should not return.\n\nHe now gave serious attention to the agricultural pursuits of his\nfather. He threw himself heartily into the work of the farm, and\nassisted in the work of sowing and harvesting, of pruning and\nthrashing according to the season. His spare time was occupied in\nreading with avidity various masterpieces of literature. The authors\nhe found at hand were such as F\u00e9n\u00e9lon and Bossuet, but he developed a\ndecided preference, which lasted till the end of his life, for Virgil\nand the Bible.\n\nIt was at this time that his taste for art began to be developed.\n\nHe drew the objects he found around him, and soon acquired sufficient\nconfidence in his skill to execute a large drawing representing two\nshepherds keeping guard over their sheep. These first efforts date\nfrom about his seventeenth year, and foretell the advent of the style\nin which he was later to become pre-eminent.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE MIGRATION TO PARIS\n\n\nHow frequently has it happened that the first years in the life of a\ngenius have been employed in labour quite different from that to which\nthey should have been directed. Such a state of affairs the more often\noccurs when the sense of duty has been strong enough to overcome\ntemporarily the inclination to pursue the natural bent. In the case of\nMillet, however, the early years which he devoted to the farm and its\npursuits were by no means wasted. It is on record that he became very\nproficient in the various duties in which he was engaged, but at the\nsame time we can be quite sure that his extraordinary faculties of\nobservation were constantly being brought into play, and the fruits of\nhis observations are to be seen in the pictures of his mature period.\n\nA considerable portion of his spare time was taken up with drawing,\nnot only the persons and objects he found around him, but also\nsubjects suggested to him by the books he was in the habit of reading.\n\nHis family, so far from throwing any obstacles in his way, encouraged\nhim. In fact it was his father who took him first to Cherbourg in\norder to show a painter of that town, named Mouchel, the early\nproducts of his son's genius. The decision at which Millet p\u00e8re had\narrived was prompted by a drawing in charcoal of an old peasant\nwalking along the road, which had struck him forcibly as being a work\nof extraordinary merit. It says much for Mouchel's breadth of mind\nthat he was equally impressed with the drawings. A man who had been\nbrought up in the school of David, and who had lived in one of the\nmost reactionary periods of French art, was hardly to be expected to\ntake kindly to a style so diametrically opposed to all the traditions\ninto which he himself had been inculcated; certainly the young\nMillet, who had now arrived at the age of eighteen, had not developed\nthe extraordinary freedom which his works of ten years later\ndemonstrate. But there was sufficient originality even in his early\ndrawings to call forth condemnation from a man who had been so\nsaturated with the teaching of David.\n\nHe prevailed upon Millet to leave his son with him, and set him to\nwork to copy many well-known works of art which he brought before his\npupil by means of engravings. Two months were spent in this way when\nnews reached Millet that his father had been seized with sudden\nillness, and he was obliged in the circumstances to return to\nGr\u00e9ville. He arrived to find the old man unconscious, and very shortly\nafterwards he died.\n\nThis misfortune awoke in Millet a sense of duty which compelled him to\ndesert his studies in Cherbourg and superintend the management of the\nfarm. For some time he devoted himself entirely to his new duties, but\nthe struggle betwixt duty and genius continued; he gave himself to his\nwork with all the energy at his disposal, but his thoughts were ever\nwandering to his art.\n\nAdded to his own inclinations, his grandmother, who perceived his\nextraordinary gifts, strongly persuaded him to devote his attention\nentirely to art, and consequently after some little time he decided to\nreturn to Cherbourg. Here he entered the studio of M. Langlois, an\nartist whose reputation in the town was considerable. Again in this\nworthy man he came in contact with a painter who had been brought up\nentirely under classical influence. Langlois, who had in his early\ndays been a pupil of Gros, had absorbed the classical tradition to\nsuch an extent as to be incapable of appreciating any other style. He\nappears to have endeavoured to mould Millet in his own method rather\nthan develop the latent genius which the latter possessed. The\nincompatibility of these two men speedily caused the younger to strike\nout in his own way. He saw more good in frequenting the museums and\nmaking copies of such works as appealed to him than in listening to\nthe advice of his teacher. All this occurred, however, without any\nbreach of friendship occurring. On the contrary, Langlois, after\nperceiving the futility of inducing his pupil to follow in his\nfootsteps, did all he could to advance his interests.\n\nBy means of his influence some of Millet's drawings were brought\nbefore the Municipal Council, and Langlois suggested that Millet\nshould be sent to Paris in order to further his development, and that\nthe Council should set aside a modest pension to meet his requirements\nin that city. The discussion appears to have been very prolonged, and\nupon the question being put to a vote it was only carried by means of\nthe casting vote of the mayor. Four hundred francs was at first\nallotted to him in this way, which was further increased shortly\nafterwards to six hundred. Such encouragement, meagre though it was,\nwas sufficient to give him a foothold in the metropolis. He left\nCherbourg in January 1837, on a cold and raw day, the snow falling\nheavily throughout the entire journey, and arrived in Paris in a very\ndisheartened condition. The miserable weather, coupled with the long\njourney in which he had had time to think of the small sum which lay\nbetween him and starvation, going to a city which he had never seen\nbefore, had all served to work upon his nerves, and he entered the\ngreat city sick at heart and very despondent.\n\nOne of the first visits he made after he was somewhat settled down in\nParis was to the Louvre. Here he was brought into contact for the\nfirst time with many masters, who were to mould his yet plastic\ntemperament into the form which enabled him to give to the world, in\nlater years, so many masterpieces. As I have said before, it was\nMantegna who first captivated him, and the influence of the mighty\nPaduan was never finally to be shaken off. Michel Angelo awed him with\nhis sublimity; his classical severity tempered with intense humanism,\nhis masculine strength, were bound to have their effect upon so\nserious a character as Millet. Strange as it may seem to those who are\nbut superficially acquainted with his art, and are only too apt to\njudge him by the influence he has had upon modern French painting, he\nwas fascinated with the antique. The traditions of Phidias and\nPraxiteles, in the form in which they had been transmitted through the\ngreatest minds of the Renaissance, were ever the factors which guided\nhim throughout his career. It was this same spirit which impelled his\nfervid admiration for Nicolas Poussin, a master who to-day is sadly\nunderrated and but little understood. It was the mysteries of line,\nthe wonders of pose and composition rather than the magic of colour\nwhich appealed to him. He had a profound admiration for the glowing\ncanvases of Titian and Rubens, but he could never overlook entirely\ntheir defects of drawing or, in the case of Rubens, the tendency to\nvulgarity. From his remarks in after years it would appear that he was\nbaffled with the mysticisms of Velazquez and Rembrandt; pure painting\nitself could never hold him. He needed to grasp the message which lay\nbehind it before he felt fully taken into the confidence of the\npainter; and as the minds of the Dutchman and the Spaniard ran in\nquite different channels to his own, they spoke with a language he\nnever understood. That he had a perceptive and critically independent\nmind may be gauged from his enthusiasm for Delacroix, whose work he\nencountered for the first time at the Luxembourg.\n\nDuring this period of study he was carefully considering under what\nmaster he should place himself. His choice unhappily fell upon\nDelaroche. To any one acquainted with the work of the latter master,\na more unsuitable selection could not have been made. Delaroche and\nthe painters who surrounded him can be appropriately described as\nconstituting the back-wash of the Empire style, which had reached its\nclimax with David. His subjects were always treated with academic\nreserve. No pyrotechnics were permitted; on the contrary, an\neverlasting and mistaken striving for finish was encouraged:\noriginality was sternly suppressed. To paint human life as it really\nwas, was too vulgar for any of the painters of this time. They held\nthe public taste enslaved for years. An innovator such as Millet was\ndestined to become found his position almost untenable. The band of\ncritics and painters formed a monopoly which it seemed almost\nimpossible to break down, and it was only after years of bitter and\ndetermined struggle that the school of nature finally routed its\nopponent.\n\nDelaroche doubtlessly found the peasant painter a little rude both in\nhis person and in his ideas about art. He paid but little attention to\nthe young man who had placed himself in his hands, and devoted all his\ntime to students who were more amenable to his influence. A\ntemperament so sensitive as Millet's was bound to notice this\nneglect, and consequently after a time he became so discouraged that\nhe ceased to frequent Delaroche's studio. Another very good reason for\nthis action was the lack of resources to continue his payments. Even\nduring the time he had been with Delaroche he lost no opportunity of\nturning a few honest francs by painting the portraits of any who could\nbe got to sit to him. Delaroche, however, had a more kindly heart than\nMillet imagined. He seems to have found out the real distress of the\nyoung artist, and to have assisted him pecuniarily in many ways, and\nthere is no doubt that he appreciated the talent of the young Norman\nmuch more than he cared to own. Many of his remarks on record would\nserve to show that Delaroche already felt that his pupil was destined\nto be one of the leaders of the movement which was finally to\noverthrow his own style, and doubtlessly felt a great admiration for a\nman who had the courage and strength to swim against rather than with\nthe current.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STRUGGLE FOR RECOGNITION\n\n\nFreed from all encumbrances save poverty, Millet was now to work out\nhis own destiny according to the dictates of his genius. He joined a\nfriend named Marolle, and the two together occupying a very small\napartment endeavoured to eke out an existence. It was only too soon\napparent that young as he was, and the taste of the public being not\nyet ready for development upon the lines his genius directed him, that\nhis livelihood could not be secured by endeavouring to sell such\nsubjects as appealed to him. In these straits he turned to\nportrait-painting, just as many great painters before and since him\nhave done. That the struggle was very keen can well be imagined by the\nfact that he was unable to obtain more than five to ten francs apiece;\nand, as commissions were very scarce, he was hard put to gain the\nmeans of subsistence. This state of affairs lasted until 1840, in\nwhich year he endeavoured to obtain admission to the Salon with two\nportraits, one of which was that of his friend. This, however, was\nrejected, and the other picture, although accepted, was unnoticed by\neither the critics or the public.\n\nHaving occasion the next year to pay a visit to Cherbourg, he felt\nobliged to report himself to the Municipal Council who had had the\ngenerosity to send him in the first place to Paris. Its worthy members\nexpressed themselves as but little satisfied with the result of their\ninvestment; they claimed that they had had as yet but little to show\nfor their money, and they suggested, partly as a means of\ndemonstrating that they had had some little return, and also, in order\nto see of what stuff their prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was made, that he should paint a\nportrait of the recently deceased mayor. As Millet had not been\npersonally acquainted with that worthy citizen, and as the only guide\nwhich could be supplied him was a portrait made in miniature when he\nwas a young man of some twenty-three or twenty-four years of age, the\ntask was by no means easy. However, the artist set to work with a\nwill, and finally accomplished the picture to his own satisfaction.\n\nUpon it being shown to the Council, one and all declared, as any one\nwith the slightest knowledge of such matters could have told them\nbefore it was commenced, that it bore not the least resemblance to the\ndefunct magistrate. They therefore demurred at the three hundred\nfrancs they had agreed to pay him for the portrait, and offered him\none-third of that amount instead. Millet was deeply offended by the\ninsult, and informed the Council that he made them a present of the\npicture.\n\nIt was during this short visit to his native country that he met his\nfirst wife, a Mlle. Ono, whose portrait he had painted. From the first\nshe was very delicate, and he lost her after much suffering, three\nyears later. His second wife was Mlle. Catherine Lemaire, who was\ndestined to be the companion of his struggles until the end of his\nlife.\n\nMeanwhile Millet was occupied with subjects which he thought would\nappeal to the general public. A number of classical pictures date from\nthis epoch. It was an endeavour on his part to fall in as far as\npossible with the current taste, and so supply means of subsistence\nfor his family. At the same time he did not neglect his favourite\nsubjects, and many are the wonderful studies of peasant life which\ndate from these years. His reputation had so far advanced that he was\noffered the position of teacher of drawing in the college at\nCherbourg. It must have been only after prolonged deliberation that he\nrefused the proffered post. Here a certain annual stipend was assured\nhim, and if it was not large in itself it would at any rate suffice to\nkeep the wolf from the door. He preferred, however, to return to Paris\nand work out his own destiny as best he might.\n\nMillet, who lived at this time in the Rue Rochechouart, began to\nsurround himself with that little group of friends who remained\nfaithful to him until the end of his career. Amongst the earliest were\nCharles Jacque and Diaz: the latter had several clients amongst the\nsmall dealers, whom he induced to visit Millet's studio and make now\nand again a small purchase.\n\nMillet now became a fairly regular contributor to the Salon, but\ngenerally sent some classical or religious picture as well as one of\nhis peasant subjects. For example, in 1848 he sent the marvellous\nstudy of \"The Winnower,\" which we all know so well, accompanied by a\ncanvas, \"The Captivity of the Jews at Babylon.\" The latter, however,\nwas so badly received that he utilised the canvas upon its return for\na large picture of a \"Shepherdess tending her Sheep.\"\n\nIn spite of the headway that he was making, the struggle for existence\nseemed keener than ever, and but for the kindness of friends he and\nhis family would frequently have actually wanted for food. A timely\nadvance of one hundred francs obtained for him from the Minister of\nFine Arts, together with a commission from the State, for which he was\npaid the sum of eighteen hundred francs, were for some time the only\nrelief he obtained from his embarrassments. That he was not particular\nas to how he earned his daily bread is apparent from the fact that he\ndid not despise an order for a shop sign for a midwife, for which he\nwas paid the miserable amount of thirty francs.\n\nThe year 1848 was not an encouraging one for a painter who was\nstanding on the threshold of his career. The whole of Europe was\nseething with revolution. A repetition of the fearful year of 1792 was\neverywhere expected. The struggle betwixt reaction and property on the\none hand, and lawlessness and revolution on the other, was being waged\nwith grim determination. The issue was for long in the balance. One\nnever knew from one day to another what was going to happen. In such a\ndeplorable state of affairs men's minds were running on politics and\nwars rather than upon art. Millet amongst the rest was called upon to\nshoulder the musket, and it can be easily imagined with what\nreluctance he did so.\n\nParis, the great centre of art, had yet not afforded him much\nencouragement. Life was dear in the big city, and surrounded on all\nsides by bricks and mortar he was not free to go out into the fields\nand study the objects which were uppermost in his mind. He resolved to\nescape from it, and once having put the plan into execution he never\nreturned.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET IN HIS MATURITY\n\n\nThe Barbizon of 1850 was a very different place from the Barbizon of\nto-day. The world fame of the men who passed a quiet and strenuous\nexistence in the little village has transformed it into a tourist\nresort, with restaurants and caf\u00e9s, the stopping-places for\nwaggonettes which in summer bring their daily load of sightseers,\neager to see the homes of the painters whose names are now household\nwords.\n\nIt would have been well-nigh impossible for the little band to have\nchosen a more suitable spot for their labours. Rousseau and Millet,\nmuch as they were drawn towards each other by the tie of a sympathetic\ndisposition and by their common interest in art, yet were widely\ndissimilar from one another in their outlook upon art and their\nmethods of worship at the common shrine. Rousseau--one can see it from\nevery picture he painted--loved with all the yearning of a passionate\nand restless temperament the inanimate in Nature. Observe with what\nfidelity he draws his trees, with what caressing tenderness his clouds\nand skies are treated; solitude appealed to him above all things, and\nif here and there he was obliged to insert a few figures to complete\nhis composition, one instinctively feels that he would rather have\nsubstituted a group of cattle or a flock of sheep. In the glades of\nthe forest, far from the busy haunts of men, with the glorious\nsunlight penetrating from above, the breeze moaning through the\nbranches, he was happy. A wild and turbulent temperament such as his\nnot infrequently discovers exquisite enjoyment amidst such perfect\ntranquillity.\n\nBarbizon, situated on the fringe of the great forest of Fontainebleau,\ntherefore, permitted Rousseau to come into daily contact with the\nscenes which so appealed to him.\n\nMillet, on the other hand, was absorbed in the peasant. The man who\ntilled the soil and raised the produce humanity requires for its\nsubsistence by the sweat of his brow; the manifold duties of the\nlabourer, his life and sorrows, appealed to him with irresistible\nforce. An unpeopled track of wild and uncultivated land would not call\nforth any emotion in him, no matter how sublime the scenery might be.\n\nThe life of the village, spreading itself into the vast and fertile\nplain behind, held him absorbed; a peasant himself and living amongst\nthe people he so loved, he was in a position to bring before an\nunthinking world the poignant monotony of their useful lives.\n\nUpon their first arrival at Barbizon, the two artists put up at a\nsmall inn, working all day in a tiny place they had rented from some\npeasants and fitted up as a studio. The inconveniences of this\narrangement were soon apparent, and shortly afterwards Millet took a\nsmall house which was destined to be his abode for the remainder of\nhis life; an old barn in the immediate vicinity meanwhile provided him\nwith an excellent studio.\n\nFrom this period onward we must date the greatest productions of the\nmaster, the works which have induced more thought than those of any\nother peasant painter. A peasant among peasants, his life was of the\nmost rigid simplicity. Behind his little abode a large garden\nstretched away almost to the fringe of the forest itself, and here he\nwas accustomed to work every morning, growing a portion of the food\nnecessary to the sustenance of his family. The afternoon he devoted to\npainting, whilst the evening was given over to intercourse with his\nlittle circle of friends. The simplicity and tranquillity of his life\naroused the whole of his powers to action, and surrounded with\neverything he valued in life he was supremely happy.\n\nThe country around Barbizon appealed to him irresistibly. The\ntimber-studded plains, the gently undulating, highly cultivated\nfields, presented a strange contrast to the wild and rugged country\namidst which he had spent his childhood, and no doubt conduced to the\ndevelopment of a more refined and contemplative style than he would\notherwise have acquired. Upon his few visits to his native country he\nappears to have been more impressed than ever with its austerity, and\nthe drawings which these journeys called forth bore ample evidence of\nthis feeling in him.\n\nLack of the necessary funds to carry on even his simple m\u00e9nage was\never the bane of Millet's life. On many occasions Sensier, his\nintimate friend and afterwards his biographer, informs us he dissuaded\nhim from suicide.\n\nThe sums that he owed, small though they were, rendered him in\nconstant fear of the brokers. With creditors so importunate in their\ndemands for satisfaction, and with the constant lack of recognition,\nwhich was his lot, it is astonishing that Millet achieved so much. He\nwas relieved more than once by the kind-hearted and ever faithful\nRousseau, who when his friend was sorest pressed found some delicately\nhidden means to relieve him. It was he who acquired for 4000 francs\nthe wonderful \"Peasant grafting a Tree,\" when the picture failed to\nfind a purchaser; and in order that Millet should not be aware of his\ngenerosity, he made the offer in the name of an imaginary American.\n\nThis sort of goodness he repeated more than once, and it redounds\nstill more to his credit when we remember that Rousseau himself was\nnot infrequently in pecuniary difficulties.\n\nA constant succession of important works made their appearance during\nthe first ten years Millet spent at Barbizon. The first was the\nwell-known \"Sower,\" which has ever been one of the most popular of his\npictures. Then came the far finer \"Peasants going to Work,\" which for\nmany years was in an English Collection. The \"Gleaners,\" perhaps the\nnoblest canvas the master ever painted, dates from 1857, in which year\nit was seen at the Salon; the celebrated \"Angelus\" followed it two\nyears later. The prices which Millet obtained for this series of\nremarkable works was fantastically small. The \"Gleaners\" brought him a\npaltry 2000 francs, whilst he accounted himself lucky to encounter an\namateur who gave him the same sum for the small \"Woman feeding Fowls.\"\n\nThe \"Angelus,\" which was never exhibited, was sold in the year it was\npainted to a Monsieur Feydeau, an architect, for 1800 francs. It then\npassed through several hands before the late Monsieur Secr\u00e9tan\ncompeted up to 160,000 francs before he became possessed of the prize\nat the John Wilson sale.\n\nThe purchase, however, proved a sound investment, for upon the\ndispersal of his collection it was knocked down for 553,000 francs to\na Monsieur Proust, acting on behalf of the French Government. The\nlatter, however, when they gave the commission to buy the picture, had\nno idea that such a high value would be placed upon it, and\nconsequently refused to ratify the sale; a syndicate now came upon the\nscene, who took it to America. The price, however, proved greater than\neven the millionaires of the States were prepared to give, and the\ncanvas again returned to France, where it found a resting-place in the\ncollection of Monsieur Chauchard, who paid the enormous sum of 800,000\nfrancs for its possession.\n\nIn 1859 Millet sent two works to the Salon, a \"Woman grazing her Cow,\"\nand \"Death and the Woodman.\" The latter, one of the most\nphilosophical of Millet's pictures, which to-day is the principal\nattraction of the Jacobsen Museum at Copenhagen, was rejected.\n\nDisappointments of this kind came with such systematic regularity to\nthe painter that he must have become proof against them. He always had\nbitter enemies amongst the critics, who never failed to pour abuse\nupon his method and his subjects. Even a number of his fellow artists\njoined in the chorus of disapproval. But the vehemence with which he\nwas attacked was striking evidence of the impression he was making and\nthe inward sense of his own powers; and the fact that he was working\nout his destiny according to the dictates of his own genius supported\nhim against this outpouring of prejudice and malice. The social side\nof life appealed to him more strongly as the years rolled on, and the\nmurmurings which had been heard in 1859 as to the socialistic\ntendencies of \"Death and the Woodman\" swelled to a roar when the\nstupendous \"Man with the Hoe\" was exhibited fourteen years later. The\nlatter, one of the most virile studies of depraved humanity which the\nworld has ever seen, has always been a favourite with social\nreformers, and has inspired one remarkable poem. Even his most\nimplacable critics were disarmed before this canvas; its power was\nmagnetic; it was an inspiration, soul moving and trenchant.\n\nHis financial difficulties never completely dispersed. At one time, in\norder to insure himself a little tranquillity, he made a contract with\ntwo speculators, whereby they were to become possessors of all the\nwork he produced for three years, in consideration of their assuring\nhim a thousand francs a month. A great number of Millet's finest\nproductions passed thus through their hands, including the \"Return\nfrom the Fields\" and the \"Man with the Hoe.\" The partners were not\nlong in quarrelling, and after a lawsuit had been fought, Millet was\nleft in the hands of a man who frequently would not or could not pay\nhim in ready money, and whose bills he was frequently forced to\ndiscount at considerable loss.\n\nOne little gleam of sunshine rendered his later days happy. This was a\ncommission from a Colmar banker, Monsieur Thomas by name, who required\nfour allegorical compositions representing the Seasons, to decorate\nhis rooms. The artist was overjoyed by this piece of good fortune,\nand immediately commenced a most conscientious study of such mural\ndecoration as was within reach, in order that he might do full justice\nto his patron. He paid frequent visits to Fontainebleau and the\nLouvre, and even desired a friend to inquire if he could not obtain\nreproductions of the frescoes at Herculaneum and Pompeii. In spite of\nall this elaborate preparation, the subjects were not such as appealed\nto his genius, and in spite of them being well and soundly painted, we\nare told that they presented no features which called for special\ncomment.\n\nHe found, however, a much more genial occupation in accomplishing a\nseries of drawings ordered by a Monsieur Gavet, who paid the artist\n1000, 700, and 450 francs each, according to their size. He made\naltogether ninety-five drawings in this way, and it is said that this\ngentleman had in his possession the finest work in black and white and\nwater-colour the artist ever executed.\n\nTowards the latter end of his life the death of dear relatives and\nfriends cast a sorrowful gloom over him. Amongst the latter Rousseau,\nwho expired in his presence on the 22nd of December 1867, was\nperhaps the loss which seemed to him hardest to bear. A staunch and\ntrusty friend, who was to be relied upon when his prospects seemed the\nmost hopeless, he had been one of the very few who had appreciated\nMillet's talents at their full worth, and who, moreover, scanty as his\nown means were, was ever ready to stretch out his hand to assist his\nstruggling friend.\n\nShortly afterwards Millet paid a visit to his patron, Herr Hartmann,\nat M\u00fcnster, and from here he went for a short time into Switzerland.\n\nUpon his return he devoted himself with great earnestness to work, and\nachieved a certain success at the Salons with his exhibits. The\noutbreak of the war with Germany caused him to migrate with his family\nto Cherbourg, where he thought he might continue to work, removed as\nfar as possible from the scenes of carnage and struggle which were\ngoing on farther east. Transported once more amongst the scenes of his\nchildhood, he felt an increased impetus to production, and when he\nreturned to Barbizon late in 1871, he brought with him a number of\ncanvases of the highest quality; conspicuous amongst them was the\nwonderful \"Gr\u00e9ville Church,\" now in the Louvre.\n\nThe anxieties of his troublous life were, however, beginning to show\ntheir effect upon his constitution; a persistent cough developed, and\nalthough an amelioration would occasionally occur, it was always\nsucceeded by a worse condition than before. His health suffered a\ngeneral decline, and he finally breathed his last on the 20th of\nJanuary 1875. He was buried in the little cemetery of Chailly, beside\nhis friend Rousseau, amidst the scenery they both loved so well.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE MAN AND HIS ART\n\n\nMillet is an instance of an artist working out his own destiny,\nimpelled by irresistible genius, in the teeth of seemingly\ninsurmountable obstacles. He started life with enormous disadvantages;\nwithout friends in influential circles to spread his fame or plead his\ncause; without money to enable him to outlive and triumph over the\nignorant fanaticism of critics and artists, so soaked in the\nconventionalised art of their time that they had not perception enough\nto appreciate the full meaning of that naturalistic movement, which\nwas finally to sweep away the quasi-classic art they boasted of with\nsuch bombastic effusion. The path was hard and thorny, and his triumph\nwas not finally consummated until after his death. He himself found\nhis only satisfaction in the fact that he had lived his life according\nto the dictates of his genius, and had achieved the maximum of which\nhe was capable.\n\nMillet and our own Cotman were somewhat kindred spirits; there is much\nmore affinity between the work of the two men than is apparent to any\none who has not closely studied them. The marvellous \"Breaking the\nClod,\" now happily permanently housed at the British Museum, betrays\nthe same tremendous conception and broad outlook which characterises\nmany a drawing of Millet's. Both highly strung to a painful extent,\nthey were each conscious of their inability to curb the power which\nprescribed a certain course for them, and in spite of pecuniary\ndifficulties and unpopularity, an inevitable result of their intense\noriginality, they pursued a steady course to the end of their lives.\n\nThe socialistic doctrines which have been read into the work of Millet\nare rather the outcome of the world's uneasy conscience being brought\nface to face with a crushing indictment of existing conditions, than\nof any design on the artist's part to further the cause of a political\npropaganda by means of his art. This somewhat extravagant reading into\nhis art has certainly been carried to excess. Particularly has such\nbeen the case in America, where a large number of his finest works are\nat present to be found, curiously enough in the hands of enormously\nwealthy people, who are frequently perhaps the least able to\nunderstand the real meaning of his message.\n\nComing from a peasant stock, his sympathies were always with the\npeasant; it was the only class he understood or cared for. He lived as\none of them, and shared to a large extent in their labour. He has been\ndesignated, not inappropriately, the philosopher in sabots. Rightly or\nwrongly he has come to be looked upon as one of the high priests of\ncommunistic doctrines. Few pictures have been so anathematised as the\n\"Man with the Hoe,\" and perhaps none have done more to inculcate\nsympathy with the degradation of the lower orders of the human race.\n\nThe revolting brutality and vacancy of that face haunts the\nimagination. Is it possible that fellow-creatures so utterly debased\nby toil and neglect exist? Millet dispels any doubt upon the question\nby bequeathing to humanity this trenchant portrait. By no means\nlimited to Barbizon or France, these poor creatures exist in every\ncountry, and curiously enough are considered an essential element in\neach country's development.\n\nThis poignantly human note is observable in almost every work Millet\nwrought; his passionate sympathy with his fellow-man is the keynote of\nhis art. The wood-cutter in his arduous toil, the shepherd in his\nsolitariness, the labourer turning the soil with unvarying and\nlaborious monotony, the mother caring for her children--all carry the\nsame message for him of that strange and incomprehensible mingling of\njoy and sadness we call life. Like many great minds before and since\nhis time, our artist found the greatest joy in life in a placid and\nnever changing melancholy. But the peasants he chose knew nothing of\nthe sadness he saw in them. Completely inured to their toil, and\nsubdued by it, with no refining or uplifting influence to stimulate\nthem, they knew nothing, aspired to nothing beyond what they were; it\nwas left to Millet to supply the \"might have been.\" He saw the inky\nblackness of the mind of the \"Man with the Hoe,\" the pathetic\ninequality between the mounted farmer directing the safe storage of\nhis crop, and the stooping figures of the \"Gleaners\" eager to scrape\nup the miserable crumbs which had fallen from the rich man's table. He\ntraced the lives of these simple folk until we arrive at the grim and\ngaunt figure of Death, who, as he grasps the woodman by the shoulder,\nreminds him that his course is finished and that he, in common with\nall his fellow-men, must enter the great unknown land from which there\nis no return. It is a sad and melancholy art, vibrating with purity\nand truth, the outpouring of a great soul yearning to express itself\nto the utmost of its power. The mind and character of the man can be\nread in every line and in every touch of the brush. His drawings and\netchings are even more searching in their virility than his pictures.\n\nThere is a spontaneousness about them we search for in vain in his\nwork in oil and pastel. In black and white his intensely emotional\nmind found a swift method of expression; in the laboriousness of oil\npainting he was fettered with the complications of the medium. It can\nbe fairly said that only in one or two paintings--a notable example\ncan be cited in the wondrous \"Sawyers\" at South Kensington--does he\nrise to the height of a great painter. Millet was a poet, a\nphilosopher, a great thinker, and the means he chose for expressing\nhimself were those which were best fitted to his purpose. His\npredilections in art were concentrated upon the greatest, and\nconsequently the men who appealed to him were the thinkers of the\nages. Mantegna and Correggio, Michel Angelo and the mighty Greeks,\nthese were the masters who left their impress upon his mind and art.\n\nThe influence of so sincere and profound an artist has necessarily\nbeen profound. He has moulded men who have achieved world-wide fame;\nSegantini, for example, would never have risen to the heights he did\nhad the example of Millet not been ever before him. There have been\nmany who, without possessing his genius, have endeavoured to follow\nin his footsteps, but successfully as his imitators have sometimes\ncaught his style, their productions can never live alongside his,\nbecause they lack the real ring of sincerity.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n        a. One bed, or folding cot,\n        b. One oil stove,\n        c. One lamp,\n        d. Enough supplies of all kinds sufficient for six months,\n        e. Pots, pans, kettles, etc.\nIt is needless to say that positions in Manila and Iloilo were now at\na premium.\n\nWas it possible that teachers were to be sent to places where even the\nnecessaries of life could not be obtained! Was it possible that many\nwould be sent to places so remote that for six months no fresh\nsupplies could be gotten! A mass meeting was held at once, and a\ncommittee was appointed to send a cablegram to the Associated Press\npetitioning aid from the American people at large. Realizing what\nconsternation would be created throughout the United States by such a\nmessage, two of the teachers leaped into a carriage at the close of\nthe meeting and a few moments later were closeted with the chief\nexecutive of the department. As a result the committee was persuaded\nnot to send the cablegram to the Associated Press until by courtesy it\nhad been sent to the President. Of course, this diplomatic move tided\naffairs over and the teachers who had flatly refused to budge from\nManila now agreed to go on to their stations, being assured that\nwhatever action was best would be taken.\n\nThe day had come when we must separate. We were to enter an untried\nand an unknown field. It was fitting that we have a final joyous\nmeeting, so the best orchestra in the archipelago was engaged and we\n\"chased the hours with flying feet\" until dawn so that whatever might\ncome to us in that unknown future upon which we were entering each\nwould hold in pleasant memory our last evening together.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER III. - A DRAMA IN ACTUAL LIFE.\n\n\nAlmost every one heeded the warning to go to his station forearmed\nwith at least necessaries of life, but, as it had never fallen to the\nlot of the writer to cook, he refused to learn at that late day, so he\ntook no pot, no pan, no kettle, putting his future into the hands of\nan uncertain fate and relying upon the unknown hospitality of the\nFilipino.\n\nBacalod, the capital of the province of Occidental Negros, was our\ndestination. The second morning after leaving Manila, we awoke with\nthe \"Kilpatrick\" lying at anchor in a shallow bay. We were several\nmiles from the shore and nothing in sight indicated that we had\nreached a place of any importance. Late the night before we had been\nawakened by the loud, sharp ringing of the ship's bells, accompanied\nby the reversal of the engines and a general disturbance awaking the\ncrew. So our first impressions on coming on deck were that we had run\naground. But the captain assured us that everything was ship-shape and\nthat this was the nearest point of approach to Capiz, a town of\nconsiderable importance on the island of Panay, where a body of troops\nwas to embark for home. Not even the grass hut of a native was in\nsight. Search as we would, not a sign was seen of a stream flowing\ninto the sea, indicating the probable presence of a town. There was\nnot a sign of life of any kind save one lone column of thin, blue\nsmoke that arose from the side of a mountain miles away. One would\nhave thought that we were explorers of three hundred years ago lying\noff the shore of some unknown land.\n\nAfter breakfast the steam launch, together with all the boats, was\nlowered, and several of us who had determined to miss no opportunity\nto gather information about the islands took our places in the launch\nby the side of the ship's mate, and steamed away across the water with\na long line of boats strung out in the rear. We headed away toward a\ngroup of cocoanut trees, and about an hour later stepped ashore on a\npile of decayed coral rocks that extended some twenty or thirty feet\nout into the water, thus forming the only landing place of a town of\nseveral thousands of people and of considerable commercial importance.\n\nA few moments after we had landed, an army wagon drawn by a\nmagnificent pair of mules came up out of a tropical jungle along a\nnarrow road. We clambered into the wagon and were soon lost in the\ndepths of foliage from which we had just seen the vehicle emerge.\n\nLong waving bamboos with their plumy leafage hung over the road from\neach side, meeting and overlapping in the center until they formed an\narchway so dense that the tropical sun now high in the heavens\npenetrated it only at intervals. At times the wagon sank up to the\nhubs in the soft earth, and the muscles of the mules stood out like\nwhip-cords under the skin as they drew us forward.\n\nAt a sharp turn in the road we came upon the first division of troops\nthat was to embark for home. The look of joy upon their sun-browned\nfaces was inexpressible. Their work was done, and with elastic step\nand smiling faces they saluted us as they passed by. The reign of\nforce was at an end; it was going out with them; the reign of peace\nhad begun; it was coming in with us.\n\nIn the afternoon when we returned from the town the last of the troops\nhad arrived and, as we drove up, the bugle was sounding the call to\nsupper. We noticed native women mingling with the troops and, indeed,\na native woman was in constant attention waiting upon one of the\nsoldiers with whom we ate. Her clothes were clean, her hair was nicely\ncombed, and her general appearance was neat. She seemed to anticipate\nthe slightest wish of the soldier with whom she was. She brought him\nwater to drink, cleaned his plate after the meal and saw that his\nknife, fork, and spoon were put into his haversack.\n\nWe had now finished supper and the launch had returned for the last\nload of troops. The lieutenant in command of the company gave the\norder to \"fall in\"; the men shouldered their rifles and fell into\nline. \"Forward, march!\" called the lieutenant, and the column swept\nforward towards the boats. The women had until now restrained\nthemselves, but, as their husbands marched away never to return, their\nfeelings could no longer be restrained. One young woman of about\neighteen, who was leaning against a rock by the roadside sobbing, when\nher husband passed, leaped up in frenzy of passionate love and caught\nthe rifle from his shoulder. Her first impulse seemed to be to throw\nthe gun away, but suddenly realizing the futility of such an act she\nburst into tears, shouldered the rifle herself and marched on by his\nside. Another woman of more mature age threw her arms around the legs\nof a tall stalwart man, and drew him bodily from the line.\n\nBut the troops marched on and entered the boats. One woman who had\nbeen unnoticed before came down into the shallow water and caught hold\nof our last boat as if to prevent its leaving, while others stood\nmingling their sobs with the sounds of the wavelets as they broke on\nthe sands. As we passed away, an expectant mother, standing in bold\noutline against the twilight sky, threw up her hands in an agony of\ndespair and then sank upon the stones. The curtain had fallen upon a\ndrama in actual life deeper in pathos than any other we had ever seen\nor ever expected to see. Depth of passion, depth of love! Who can\nfathom the human heart?\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. - WHAT THE TEACHERS DID.\n\n\nThere is a remarkable sameness about the towns in the Philippines.\n\nThey all have a large open square about the middle of the town, around\nthree sides of which are Chinese stores, unless one side lies open to\nthe sea, and on the fourth is the great stone ecclesia. The streets\nrun at right angles to one another and divide up the town into\ncreditable squares.\n\nEverybody in the Philippines lives up-stairs, for the ground is so\nsoaked with water during the rainy season that it is a menace to\nhealth to live upon the ground floor. So even the poorest nippa hut\nis built upon stakes four or five feet above the ground.\n\nBacalod is a typical Philippine town. As we landed, a broad open\nsquare was spread out before us. Two sides of the square were lined\nwith two-story houses in which were Chinese stores below and Filipino\nhomes above. On the third side stood the great stone church in whose\nmassive tower the clock was striking the hour of four, while the\nfourth lay open to the sea that had borne us thither.\n\nWe landed, but it was in a method new to us and one not usually\nemployed by the traveling public.\n\nWhen our sail boat ran aground on the sandy bottom a hundred yards or\nmore from the shore, a crowd of Filipino men who were on the beach\nslowly rolled up their pantaloons and waded out to the rescue,--for\nthe money that was in it. The boat's crew elevated their trousers'\nlegs also and slided down into the water. Each of us then straddled\nthe neck of a Filipino standing in the water and was held by ankles to\nbe steadied while our biped mounts proceeded to the shore.\n\nWe were now on the ground and face to face with the situation. To give\nthe reader an idea of the actual conditions met by the first teachers\nwho went to the Islands, the following is copied from the instructions\ngiven us in Manila:\n    1. There shall be two sessions daily of all schools, and the\n    last hour of the morning session shall be devoted solely to\n    instructing the Filipino teachers.\n\n    2. In cases where teachers are sent to a town in which there\n    is no school-house, they are expected to secure the aid of the\n    people and have one built.\n\n    3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is\n    stopped.\n\n    4. All supplies must be kept under lock and key. In towns\n    where there is no case or box to lock the supplies in, and it\n    is also impossible to get the town council to furnish a case,\n    a requisition may be sent to Manila, and, if an appropriation\n    can be secured, one will be made and sent out.\n\nThus it can be easily seen that we were indeed pioneers. In many\nplaces no school-house was to be found, and in some cases it was even\ndifficult to get the town council to provide a case in which to keep\nthe supplies.\n\nThe work of the teachers was, in short; to \"make the English language\nthe basis of instruction in the public schools.\" On our arrival at\nBacalod two schools were found in progress, for some soldiers had been\ndetailed for the work here previous to our coming. One of these was\nfor boys and the other, for girls. Thus the work here had been in a\nmeasure simplified, but complications that had arisen at Talisay, one\nof the largest and richest towns on the island, demanded a change of\nteachers and the writer was assigned to the place as superintendent.\n\nHere an attempt had been made to start a school but it had failed\nignominiously and a system of education was to be put into operation\nfrom the very start.\n\nThe Filipinos are not strong advocates of co-education, so separate\nschools were to be started for the boys and the girls. The one for the\nboys was gotten well in hand before the one for the girls was\nattempted at all.\n\nA few days after reaching the town and securing a home the\npresidente of the town had it publicly announced that the following\nMonday morning at eight o'clock a public school for boys would be\nopened in a building that had been rented for the purpose by the\nmunicipal council. About the middle of the afternoon of the same day a\nman beat a little drum throughout all the streets of the town to call\nthe people out and the town clerk announced both in Spanish and in the\nnative language that this public school would begin at the time and\nplace mentioned above; that instruction would be free to all who came;\nthat the government would furnish all supplies; and that instruction\nwould be given in the English language. A native principal and\nassistants were employed and everything was ready to begin.\n\nThe official report of the result is as follows:\n    Boys' public school of Talisay, Negros, P. I., began November\n    4, 1901. Forty-three boys present at eight o'clock. Forty-one\n    of them knew \"good morning\" and \"good afternoon\" but do not\n    know the distinction between them. Two of them speak simple\n    Spanish. At eight forty-five, eight more, who had been\n    attending an early morning private school, came in together.\n\n    The books they brought were so varied and so different from\n    one another that it seemed impossible to bring any reasonable\n    degree of order out of such a chaos, and so, after struggling\n    vainly for about a week with the problem, the superintendent\n    by one fell stroke removed everything in use and put in a\n    uniform system, and from that day on the English language has\n    been the basis of instruction in the public schools of\n    Talisay. The work was of necessity very slow at first, but by\n    the end of a year two schools were going nicely and a number\n    of the brightest boys and girls had made really excellent\n    progress.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER V. - A \"BAILE.\"\n\n\nNot long after the arrival of our party at Bacalod we received an\ninvitation to a \"baile\" given in our honor by the inhabitants of\nSilay, a town some ten or twelve miles up the northern coast and one\nnoted for its social life. The invitation was accepted with pleasure,\nand about the middle of the afternoon on the day appointed we were\nclad in the immaculate white of the tropics and steaming away up the\ncoast on board a launch sent for our conveyance. Twilight was still\nlingering on the path of day when we anchored just off shore at the\ntown. A row-boat containing the officials of the city came out to meet\nus and, in due season, we were ushered into a spacious drawing-room\nfilled almost to overflowing with the \u00e9lite of the town. The \u00e9lite of\ntowns in the Philippines speak Spanish, and, as only one or two of our\nparty could at that time boast of more than a formal acquaintance with\nthe Castilian tongue, the exchange of ideas that evening between us\nand the Filipinos was of necessity not very rapid.\n\nThe necessity of easy communication between us was rendered somewhat\nless indispensable by the announcement of supper as soon as we were\nrested from our trip. When we had taken our places at the table a\nyoung Filipino about twenty-five years of age arose and gave a lengthy\ntoast to the recent union of the Philippines with the United States.\n\nBut as we Americans were unable to scale the dizzy heights of his\nclimaxes or sink to the depths of his pathos, we forewent the\npleasures of his oratory and turned our attention to the savory odor\nof lamb, chicken, and roast pig that came slyly stealing up our\nnostrils to send us nerve dispatches about the gastronomic delights of\nour not far distant future.\n\nAt last the toast was ended and the world-wide soup ushered in a long\ntrain of things good to eat, served in a style better fitted to the\ndelights of the appetite than to the formalities of dinners, for, as\nsoon as the pleasant task of one dish was completed by any one, the\nnext was served him at once regardless of the progress made by the\nothers at the table.\n\nThe last course was dulce. The new-comers to the Philippines will\nnot be long in making the acquaintance of this dish, and at all\nmeetings, both public and private, where eatables are served, it\nperforms an important part. It is anything sweet, and it may vary all\nthe way from an india-rubber-like black mixture of cocoanut milk and\ndirty sugar to a really toothsome and respectable confection. No\nmatter of what materials a dish is composed, just so long as it is\nsweet, it is dulce.\n\nAfter paying our respects to this last course, we arose from the table\nand entered a great rectangular room from the center of whose ceiling\nhung a large glass chandelier, a mass of shimmering crystals. In the\nchairs around the room were the wealth, the youth, and the beauty of\nthe town.\n\nThe first and also the last number of every Filipino dance of any\nformality is the \"rigodon.\" The dancers are arranged in a square, or\nquadrangle according to the number participating, and are then led\nthrough a tangled maze of figures that so utterly bewilders the novice\nthat he sinks into his chair at the end of the dance wondering how it\nall came to pass.\n\nWe Americans breathed a sigh of relief when the \"rigodon\" ended, and\nmustered fresh courage for social conquests in the waltz that was now\nbreathing forth from the trembling strings. My companion in the first\ndance had been the young lady by whose side I had sat at dinner. But\nit now became necessary to search for another, so I prudently waited\nto see how partners were chosen, and made no mistake when a few\nmoments later I faced one of the most luscious looking se\u00f1oritas on\nthe opposite side of the room and offered her my arm. My eyes must\nhave told the story that my lips could not utter in Spanish, for she\nsmiled upon me sweetly, arose, and put her hand upon my shoulder. My\narm encircled her waist and I began to waltz. Unfortunately my\ncompanion did not follow, but began to hop up and down in a manner\nmost distressing. Supposing the attack to be only temporary, I paused\nand, much to my relief, she soon showed signs of recovery; and in the\ncourse of time she came to a standstill looking up into my face in an\ninquiring sort of way, apparently wondering why St. Vitus had not paid\nhis respects to me also. A second attempt to follow the music met with\nresults similar to the first, and during the third attempt, which\nseemed to be trembling on the verge of a failure, St. Vitus let go my\ncompanion and seized me with such vigor that she, who was small even\nfor a Filipino, was gathered up bodily and taken around the room at\nsuch a pace that her toes touched the floor only at far distant\nintervals.\n\nAt this point my devotion to the shrine of Terpsichore ceased from\nforce of circumstances and I seated myself in one of the most\ncomfortable chairs in sight that I might carry out a previously formed\nplan to study the Filipino somewhat critically as he appears in\nsociety.\n\nThe first thing that impressed me as the dancers passed up and down\nthe room was the flash of diamonds. Nearly every woman in the room had\non a brooch that flashed the colors of the rainbow at every turn.\n\nAlmost all of them wore one or more rings that showed up brilliantly\nunder the chandelier. Many of the men too, especially the young men,\nwore gems that appeared to be exquisite. A closer inspection showed\nthat some of the gems had flaws and others were of a poor color, but\nno one would have denied that, taken as a whole, it was a really\nbeautiful display.\n\nThe dress of the ladies was richly colored. Many of their skirts were\nof silk covered with hand embroidered flowers, and their filmy pina\nwaists and broad collar pieces were rich with needle-work. They all\nwore a kind of heelless velvet slipper, very common as a dress shoe in\nthe Philippines, or high-heeled patent leather shoes with neatly\nfitting black stockings.\n\nThe men were dressed in white coats and white pantaloons or black\ncoats and white pantaloons. White shirts and collars, together with\nall sorts and styles of cravats and low-cut patent leather shoes with\nhighly colored socks completed their dress.\n\nIt was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money;\nthat they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a\ntable loaded with good things was a fact to which all of us were\nenthusiastic witnesses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VI. - A SKETCH OF LIFE IN THE PHILIPPINES.\n\n\nHouse-keeping in the Philippines presents some interesting phases. Our\nclub of American officials decided to run a mess, so we employed a\ncook and a house boy, then each of us provided himself with a personal\nservant, making a total of six servants for four men--it takes about\nthis proportion of servants to live in any sort of comfort in the\nPhilippines--and launched ourselves boldly upon the sea of domestic\neconomy. But there were shoals ahead of us, for the question of\nregulating servants is one of no small importance in the Philippines,\nand one of its most disadvantageous features is the long chain of\ndependents that usually attends it.\n\nWe gave the cooks so much a day with which to buy supplies in the\nlocal market, for our own table, making him render a daily list of\nexpenditures, and a fixed amount besides to purchase rice and fish for\nhimself and the other servants. Of course, if they wished to vary\ntheir diet and get chicken and fresh pork, which could be had at far\ndistant intervals, it was wholly a matter of their option, but the\nallowance was made on the basis of so much rice and fish a day for\neach. This allowance was about fifteen cents a day in Spanish coin per\nservant.\n\nThus far all was well. We had agreed to give the cook eight dollars a\nmonth in Spanish money, thinking that good wages would procure good\nservice, but the visions of affluence that floated before him on such\nfloods of wealth were so alluring that they drew him from the kitchen\nto the cooler veranda. In less than a week he had employed an\nassistant at four dollars a month; in less than another week that\nassistant had employed him an assistant at two dollars a month; in\nless than another week that assistant to the assistant had employed\nhim an assistant at the princely salary of fifty cents a month; and\nfrom fear that the chain of dependents would end only by our having\nthe whole Filipino race attached to our culinary force, we broke up\nhouse-keeping and went boarding again, choosing that as the less of\nthe two evils.\n\nOur house furnishings were almost wholly Philippine. The table ware\nand the food on the table came from the ends of the earth. The knives\nand forks were made in Germany, the plates were manufactured in\nEngland, the glass ware and table cloth, in the United States. The\noatmeal and flour came from the United States also. The butter came\nfrom Australia, the rice from China, the salt from Russia, and the\nother eatables from sources about as various as their separate names.\n\nSwitzerland furnished the condensed milk and Illinois the canned\ncream. Nearly all of the canned fruit bore labels from Spain.\n\nThus it can easily be seen that life in the Philippines, if lived\naccording to American ideals, is dependent upon a highly developed and\nhighly complex commerce. However, the difficulties of transportation\nand the restriction of large stocks of merchandise to Manila and some\nhalf a dozen other towns, make so great a difference between country\nlife and city life that a short comparison of the two will not be out\nof place, and life in Manila may well be taken as being fairly typical\nof the latter.\n\nLife in Manila is pleasant, but expensive. It is pleasant from the\nfact that it is not only the capital but also metropolis of the\narchipelago. Thus the combination of wealth and high official position\nhas given to Manila a society of the highest and most refined type.\n\nThe process of beautifying and improving the city which is constantly\ngoing on bids fair to give us at no distant day a city of which we may\nwell be proud.\n\nBut let him who intends living well in Manila on a small income bid\nfarewell at once to so idylic a dream, for it costs much to live well\nthere. In the city of Manila one can get almost anything he wishes,\nbut it must be paid for at the price it commands. Especially in the\ncase of eatables, this price is by no means small, because to the\nfirst cost of articles must in most cases be added the expense of\ndistant shipment from American, European, or Australian ports, and not\ninfrequently the cost of long refrigeration must also be taken into\nconsideration. But, expensive though it is, it is very pleasant to\nlive there and those who have once enjoyed it often wish again to\nquaff the cup of its delights.\n\nIn strong contrast to this pleasant life is the life of the quiet\nlittle hamlet away in the distant islands. Indeed, the Filipino from\nthe distant town, who by some good fortune has been to Manila, or, by\na coup de main, has studied in one of the Manila colleges, is looked\nup to in a true hero-worshiping attitude by all who either know him or\nhear of his fame. Life in such a place is one long state of harmless\ninactivity. Not a wave of trouble from the great outer world ever\ndisturbs its peaceful repose. One lounges forever in an air of\nindolent ease and extreme aversion to anything approaching what might\nbe called a respectable effort.\n\nOne arises in the morning about the time the sun's first rays silver\nthe top leaves of the cocoanut trees and then stirs around until nine\nor ten o'clock, when it is found expedient to avoid a further exposure\nto the sun. From then until about five o'clock in the afternoon it is\nbest to take things as they come, even though one of those things be a\nFilipino dinner. But then you may have your vehiclo attached to a\nyoung bull with a ring in his nose and go for a drive. If it is the\ndry season you will probably enjoy the drive unless you object to the\nfrequent clouds of dust swept along by the evening wind. If it is in\nthe rainy season your pleasure will depend to a considerable extent\nupon how wet you get; but, whether the season be wet or dry, your\npleasure will be regulated largely by the state of harmony existing\nbetween the driver and the bull.\n\nIn these quiet secluded nooks successive generations of Filipinos are\nborn, reared, grow old and die in an even chain of events broken only\nby the occasional erection of a new grass house on the identical spot\nwhere its predecessors have stood for ages. The son lives in the house\nof his father, cultivates the same few square feet of soil planted in\nedible roots, climbs the same cocoanut trees, follows the same winding\npath down to the stream, pounds rice in the same mortar and with the\nsame stick that his ancestors have used from time unremembered, and,\nin case of illness, curls up on a grass mat in a corner of the room\nuntil he dies or by some good fortune recovers. Beyond this narrow\nhorizon he never looks. So narrow and contracted is the life that the\nlanguages of two towns a few miles apart are so different that one\nwould scarcely recognize them as belonging to the same race of people.\n\nSuch are the two extremes of life in our new far Eastern provinces:\nthe one is active, progressive, and cosmopolitan; the other, inactive,\ndecadent, and narrow; but, whether one enjoys the first or endures the\nsecond, there comes to him after leaving a longing to lounge again in\ntropic airs and listen to the lullaby of the winds among the palms.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VII. - THE FILIPINO AT HOME.\n\n\nAs one enters a Filipino sitting-room for the first time, there is one\nfeature in the arrangement of the furniture that impresses itself upon\nhim at once, and it may be stated without fear of serious\ncontradiction that this same peculiar feature in its arrangement will\ncontinue to face him, as he enters different homes, about as certainly\nas he crosses the threshold.\n\nThe arrangement referred to is that of one large mirror, one settee,\nand some ten or a dozen chairs that appear to have had a certain\norderly affection for one another. The mirror is hung upon one of the\nlarge interior parts of the house about four feet above the floor. The\nwooden houses in the Philippines are built by setting large posts\nupright into the ground, extending into the air from twenty to thirty\nfeet. Cross timbers are fastened to these upright posts about eight or\nten feet above the ground and then not sawed off even with the posts,\nbut allowed to extend beyond them each way. The framework of the house\nis built upon these extending cross timbers, a style of building by\nwhich these large upright posts are left standing out on the inside of\nthe room from one to three feet from the walls. It is on that one of\nthese posts most nearly opposite the door that the mirror always finds\nits place. Immediately beneath the mirror is the settee; and the\nchairs are arranged in two parallel lines facing one another and at\nright angles with the ends of the settee. However odd this arrangement\nmay appear to one when he first enters a Filipino drawing-room, there\nare two things to be said in its favor. In the first place, it places\nyou face to face with the person with whom you are conversing so that\nyou can watch him,--a matter of no small moment in the Philippines. In\nthe next place, it enables you to give one of the young ladies a\nsheep's-eye in the mirror while the others present are left where\nMoses was in our much abused conundrum.\n\nThe size of the residence and the quality of its furnishings depends\nupon the wealth of the owner. But there is so vast a difference\nbetween the mode of life of the highest class and the tao, or lowest\nclass, that it is well to speak of them separately, and the great\nmiddle class of Filipinos can easily be imagined to occupy the\nintervening ground.\n\nThe rich Filipino's house is usually of wood built upon a wall of\nstone or brick from ten to fifteen feet high. The floors are kept\nhighly polished in his hallway, dressing-room, and bed-rooms. There\nare, of course, no fire-places in any of the rooms, but on some\noccasions something is needed to dry the rain-soaked atmosphere, for\neven in the dry season it has been seen to rain for five successive\ndays and nights without the cessation of a moment.\n\nA long chain of dependents is attached to the household of the rich\nFilipino. The master has his special body servant to be present at all\ntimes to do his master's bidding, in short, to be the visible\nmechanism of his master's volition. So, too, the lady of the house has\nher servant woman to do the slightest bidding of her ladyship. Then\nthere is the cook who is almost invariably a man, a house boy or two,\nand the coachman. These functionaries, with their assistants and\nassistants to the assistants, together with a servant or two for the\nexclusive service of the children, complete the economic household.\n\nSuch a family has an abundance of rice and wheat bread, also of\nchicken and fish with occasional fresh beef. They have also a good\ndeal of dulce. They regularly serve wine and frequently serve beer\non their tables.\n\nIn strong contrast with this mode of life is that of the tao. His\ndiet consists almost wholly of rice and small uncleaned fish boiled\ntogether. As a rule knife, fork, plate, and spoon find no place in his\nhousehold. The rice and fish are boiled in a pot and then allowed to\ncool in the same vessel or poured out to cool in a large earthen or\nwooden bowl. Then Mr. Tao together with Mrs. Tao and all the young\nTaos squat on their heels around the mixture and satisfy that\nintangible thing called the appetite. They do not use chop sticks as\nthe Chinese do, but the rice and fish are caught in a hollow formed by\nthe first three fingers of the right hand. The thumb is then placed\nbehind the mass. It is raised up and poised before the mouth, with a\nskill coming from the evolution of ages, when a contraction of the\nmuscles of the thumb throws the mass into the mouth with a skill that\nis marvelous to any but a Filipino. To judge from the most reliable\ninformation, the poorest class do not have an abundance of food,\nalthough it would seem that such a condition of things would be\nwell-nigh impossible. However, in a census of one hundred school\nchildren there were found six boys and four girls who declared that\nthey had never had enough to eat, and the native teacher stated that\nthis was probably true.\n\nThe wide gulf between the tao and the rich man is filled by the\ngreat middle class of Filipinos.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VIII. - VISIT TO A LEPER COLONY.\n\n\nNot far from our town was a leper colony and the first Saturday that\ncould be spared was set aside for a trip to the place. It happened\nthat none of the other Americans were at leisure on this particular\nmorning, but, rather then delay the trip or miss it altogether, the\nwriter, armed with a revolver, started out alone.\n\nThe road had been described so accurately by one who was supposed to\nknow it that it was deemed well-nigh impossible to miss the way. The\nmain highway was followed to the point where the by-path supposed to\nlead to the settlement turned off through some bamboo thickets and a\nlow tropical wood. This path led straight away towards the sea-coast\nwhere the houses of the colony were said to stand in a cocoanut grove\nby the beach.\n\nUpon arriving at the settlement, a very inhospitable reception was\nreceived from a mangy cur that growled and showed a very uninviting\nset of sharp, white teeth behind his snarling lips. The growling of\nthe dog had attracted the attention of an old man who, with age-bent\nback, was pounding rice in a mortar about fifty yards away. He turned\nslowly around and, upon seeing an intruder into the primitive quiet of\nthe place, gave a sharp, far-reaching call. The sound had scarcely\nrung through the grove when from about a dozen of the little grass\nhouses dotted here and there fifteen or twenty men armed with bolos\ncame out and gathered around the old man. A sense of my danger flashed\nupon me. Three miles from town and alone in a tropical jungle, I could\nbe almost instantly overcome by this band of bolo-men, and the only\nreport that would ever reach my people would be that I had\n\"disappeared.\" Of course, attack was by no means certain, but the\npotentiality of the situation was thrilling. A drawn revolver and the\ngleaming of its shining barrel had the effect of stopping the men, who\nseemed to be hesitating as to a course of action, until a somewhat\ndignified retreat was made to an open space in the rear from where a\nless dignified and a more hasty retreat began which did not stop short\nof Bacalod.\n\nEnough had been seen, however, even in this short visit, to give\nconvincing proof that the settlement visited was no colony of lepers;\nso, that afternoon two servant boys being taken as guides and\ninterpreters, another attempt was made to reach the goal desired.\n\nThis attempt was successful, and, after about two hours of walking, a\nlittle cluster of grass huts snugly hidden by the sea-coast came into\nview. As we approached, one would have thought it a gala-day. Some few\nchildren, apparently from six to thirteen years of age, almost wholly\nnude, were romping and playing in the open space around which the huts\nstood, and no one would ever have thought that any cloud so horrible\nas leprosy could hover over a place apparently so happy.\n\nBy the side of the path as we passed was a man and his wife setting\nout potato plants. His hands were so puffed and his fingers so short\nthat he could scarcely use them, but he was working along as best he\ncould. His wife's feet were so swollen and twisted that she walked\nonly with the greatest difficulty. We passed them by and entered the\nopen space above referred to.\n\nThe children now saw us, and those of them who could darted away like\nfrightened rabbits, each to his own burrow. An old man who was sitting\nin the warm afternoon sun on the little bamboo platform before his hut\nwas aroused from his lethargic repose by the scampering away of the\nchildren. He arose, trembling upon his tottering limbs, all drawn and\ntwisted, and hobbled away into his hut.\n\nThe children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at\nthe doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of\nthe settlement. In a few moments we were surrounded by a circle of\nhuman beings at once so repulsive and so pitiable that its graphic\nvividness can never be accurately portrayed.\n\nThe old man referred to above, having put on a pair of snow-white\npantaloons, appeared now at the doorway of his hut, followed a few\nmoments later by his wife who had evidently clothed herself in the\nbest raiment she had. At a call from the old man, all the men, women,\nand children in the settlement came out of their huts and stood in a\nline before us. The old man was spokesman and in his native visayan\ntongue made a heart-rending appeal for aid which we were powerless to\ngive. Attention was called to a leper woman, apparently about\ntwenty-five years of age, whose face had been attacked by the disease\nand whose appearance was truly pathetic. Upon her hip was a child\nabout a year and a half old and, strange to say, the child showed as\nyet no signs whatever of the disease.\n\nWhat an indissoluble enigma is life! Here in a little cluster of grass\nhuts in a secluded nook of a secluded island of an all but secluded\narchipelago was gathered together a little community of wretched\nnatives, driven by their loathsomeness from association with others\neven of the same half-savage race. Yet here, men and women loved and\nwere married, by mutual trust if not by law, and children were born of\nthe union to live forever under the unspeakable horror that\novershadowed the unfortunate parents. Love, hatred, sorrow, and\njoy--every passion that enters into the complex structure of the human\nheart even here, in this scene of sadness and despair, was playing\napparently as freely as where misfortune and disease had never crossed\nthe portals of life.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER IX. - A \"HIKE.\"\n\n\nWe were lounging lazily in our hammocks at Jimamaylan one evening in\nApril. Supper was just ended, and the soldiers in the post were\ncollected in groups here and there spinning yarns to pass away the\ntime, when a Filipino clad only in a loin cloth came down the street\nat a steadily swinging run and stopped in front of the sentry. He\nbrought the announcement that a band of ladrones had just burned a\nsugar mill and were advancing to sack a barrio about fifteen miles\naway.\n\nThe invitation of the commanding officer to go on a \"hike\" was eagerly\naccepted, and, in ten minutes after the message was given, the troops\nwere on the march followed by two adventurous pedagogues.\n\nDarkness was just closing in as we left the town, but a resplendent\ntropic moon soon made the night almost as brilliant as the day. The\ntrail we followed led over rough and rocky country. Sometimes for a\ndistance of a mile or more we passed over barren wastes of volcanic\nslag poured out in anger by some peak whose convulsions have long\nsince ceased. Again we would descend into a tropical jungle from the\ndense foliage of which the ladrones could have leaped at any moment,\nhad they known of our coming, and annihilated our little band. We\nforded rapid streams with the water at our breasts, and halted only\nonce in that rapid march of fifteen miles.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the town we met a man who was standing\nguard against a surprise by the ladrones. Nothing could well have been\nmuch more grotesque and nothing could much better illustrate the\nabsolutely primitive condition of the Filipinos in the interior of the\nislands than the appearance of this guard. A pair of knee pants, a\nconical grass hat, and a hemp shirt formed his entire apparel. A long\nflat wooden shield, a bolo, and a long bamboo spear with a sharp,\nflat, iron point, completed his equipment for battle.\n\nHere stood the first and the twentieth centuries side by side. The\nFilipino who had advanced only a stage beyond the condition of\nprimitive man with his knife, spear, and wooden shield, stood side by\nside with the American soldier, a representative of modern life with\nhis magazine rifle, his canteen, his knapsack,--with every article of\nhis clothing made to give him the highest possible efficiency as the\nunit of a military organization.\n\nA few yards farther on we met another guard equipped similarly to the\nfirst. Upon reaching the town, news had just been received that a\ndetachment of troops from another post had intercepted the ladrones\nand fought a skirmish with them. The ladrones had escaped and we set\nout in pursuit of them on a chase wilder than a Quixotic dream. We\nwound our way into the mountains behind the town, inquiring at every\ngrass hut we passed whether the band of ladrones had passed that way,\nbut only once was even a trace of them found. Then it was learned that\nat a certain place they had separated into groups of three or four and\ngone glimmering through the dream of things that were. This place was\nin a secluded nook of the mountains where in years gone by some\nadventurous Spaniard had erected a primitive water mill to grind his\nsugar-cane. We had now marched about twenty miles and the feet of the\npedagogues were a mass of blisters. They had reached the point where\nthat form of military maneuvering called \"hiking\" ceased to possess\nany alluring charms. So a native was persuaded to come out of his lone\nmountain hut and hitch up his carabao and cart. He was then made to\nget on the carabao's back, while the aforesaid pedagogues lay down on\nthe sugar-cane pulp that had been put into the body of the cart, and\nthe driver was instructed to start for the post we had left hours\nbefore, and not to stop until he got there. Being uncertain but that\nsome of the ladrones would learn of our having left the body of troops\nand would try the metal of our steel, we at first agreed that neither\nof us should go to sleep, but it was later decided that probably the\ndriver had no greater desire to cross the Styx than his passengers had\nand that in case of danger he would awaken us, so both took a revolver\nin each hand, stretched out supinely and went to sleep.\n\nSuch a sleep! The rough jolting of the cart over an almost impassable\nroad was never enough to break the spell of slumber. When we awoke the\nblazing tropic sun was past the midday mark of morning, shining full\ninto our unprotected and well-nigh blistered faces.\n\nA pack of dogs were heralding our approach to a little village at the\nfoot of the mountains where ponies were procured to take us back to\nthe post."

                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently\nno time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth dimension of Space\nas a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house\nbecame quite quiet.\n\nOn reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up\nagainst a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realize\nhis position. Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\nhundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the\nDowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone\ninto hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains on\none of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who\nhad been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr\nto nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair\nby the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six\nweeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become\nreconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that\nnotorious sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible\nnight when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his\ndressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and\nconfessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox\nout of \u00a350,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card, and swore that\nthe ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back\nto him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because\nhe had seen a green hand tapping at the window-pane, to the beautiful\nLady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round\nher throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin,\nand who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of the\nKing's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he went\nover his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as\nhe recalled to mind his last appearance as \"Red Reuben, or the Strangled\nBabe,\" his d\u00e9but as \"Guant Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,\"\n\nand the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely\nplaying ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And\nafter all this some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him\nthe Rising Sun Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite\nunbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever been treated in this\nmanner. Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance, and remained till\ndaylight in an attitude of deep thought.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III\n\n\nThe next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed\nthe ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. \"I have\nno wish,\" he said, \"to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say\nthat, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,\"--a very just remark,\nat which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.\n\n\"Upon the other hand,\" he continued, \"if he really declines to use the\nRising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him. It\nwould be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside\nthe bedrooms.\"\n\nFor the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the\nblood-stain on the library floor. This certainly was very strange, as\nthe door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept\nclosely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a\ngood deal of comment. Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red,\nthen it would be vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came\ndown for family prayers, according to the simple rites of the Free\nAmerican Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright\nemerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party\nvery much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening. The\nonly person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia, who,\nfor some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the\nsight of the blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was\nemerald-green.\n\nThe second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in\nthe hall. Rushing down-stairs, they found that a large suit of old\narmour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone\nfloor, while seated in a high-backed chair was the Canterville ghost,\nrubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face. The\ntwins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged\ntwo pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained\nby long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United\nStates Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in\naccordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost\nstarted up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a\nmist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so\nleaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase\nhe recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of\ndemoniac laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely\nuseful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single\nnight, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French\ngovernesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly\nlaughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and\nrang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door\nopened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown. \"I am\nafraid you are far from well,\" she said, \"and have brought you a bottle\nof Doctor Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a\nmost excellent remedy.\" The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at\nonce to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an\naccomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family\ndoctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's\nuncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps,\nhowever, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself\nwith becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep\nchurchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.\n\nOn reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the\nmost violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross\nmaterialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what\nreally distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit\nof mail. He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by\nthe sight of a Spectre in armour, if for no more sensible reason, at\nleast out of respect for their natural poet Longfellow, over whose\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\nhour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides it was his own suit.\n\nHe had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament, and had\nbeen highly complimented on it by no less a person than the Virgin Queen\nherself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely overpowered\nby the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen\nheavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees severely, and\nbruising the knuckles of his right hand.\n\nFor some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of\nhis room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.\n\nHowever, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to\nmake a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his\nfamily. He selected Friday, August 17th, for his appearance, and spent\nmost of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in\nfavour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet\nfrilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards evening a\nviolent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was\njust such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to\nmake his way quietly to Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the\nfoot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\nof low music. He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville\nblood-stain by means of Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent. Having reduced\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and\nhis wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead,\nwhile he hissed into her trembling husband's ear the awful secrets of\nthe charnel-house. With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made\nup his mind. She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and\ngentle. A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more\nthan sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the\ncounterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins, he was quite\ndetermined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be done was, of\ncourse, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling\nsensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each\nother, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse,\ntill they became paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw off the\nwinding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white, bleached bones and\none rolling eyeball, in the character of \"Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's\nSkeleton,\" a r\u00f4le in which he had on more than one occasion produced a\ngreat effect, and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of\n\"Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.\"\n\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the\nlight-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves\nbefore they retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still,\nand, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the\nwindow-panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family\nslept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\ncould hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States. He\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his\nmurdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like\nan evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.\n\nOnce he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only\nthe baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange\nsixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\nin the midnight air. Finally he reached the corner of the passage that\nled to luckless Washington's room. For a moment he paused there, the\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's\nshroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was\ncome. He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had\nhe done so than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid\nhis blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was\nstanding a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous\nas a madman's dream! Its head was bald and burnished; its face round,\nand fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\nfeatures into an eternal grin. From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\nlight, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like\nto his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form. On its breast\nwas a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of\nshame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime,\nand, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\n\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's\njack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler. Once in the\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small\npallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes. After a time, however,\nthe brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to\ngo and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight. Accordingly,\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling\nthat, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid\nof his new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins. On reaching\nthe spot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had\nevidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from\nits hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it\nwas leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable\nattitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his\nhorror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a\nrecumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity\nbed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow\nturnip lying at his feet! Unable to understand this curious\ntransformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there,\nin the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:--\n        +------------------------------------+\n        |         YE OTIS GHOSTE             |\n        | Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook, |\n        |    Beware of Ye Imitationes.       |\n        |   All others are counterfeite.     |\n        +------------------------------------+\nThe whole thing flashed across him. He had been tricked, foiled, and\nout-witted! The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his\ntoothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his\nhead, swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\nschool, that, when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds\nof blood would be wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.\n\nHardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of\na distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh,\nand waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\nreason, did not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back\nto his room, thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose. There he\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was\nexceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which this oath\nhad been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second time. \"Perdition\nseize the naughty fowl,\" he muttered, \"I have seen the day when, with my\nstout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow\nfor me an 'twere in death!\" He then retired to a comfortable lead\ncoffin, and stayed there till evening.\n\n\nCHAPTER: IV\n\n\nThe next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were\ncompletely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five\ndays he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point\nof the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want\nit, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a\nlow, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating\nthe symbolic value of sensuous phenomena. The question of phantasmic\napparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a\ndifferent matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large\noriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every month, and he\ndid not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is\nquite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand,\nhe was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.\n\nFor the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as\nusual between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible\nprecaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots,\ntrod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large\nblack velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for\noiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good\ndeal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of\nprotection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he\nslipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a\nlittle humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see\nthat there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a\ncertain degree, it served his purpose. Still in spite of everything he\nwas not left unmolested. Strings were continually being stretched across\nthe corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion,\nwhile dressed for the part of \"Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley\nWoods,\" he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide,\nwhich the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry\nChamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged\nhim, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and\nsocial position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the\nnext night in his celebrated character of \"Reckless Rupert, or the\nHeadless Earl.\"\n\nHe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in\nfact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means\nof it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord\nCanterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome\nJack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\ndown the terrace at twilight. Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\nLord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken\nheart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it\nhad been a great success. It was, however an extremely difficult\n\"make-up,\" if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more\nscientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three\nhours to make his preparations. At last everything was ready, and he was\nvery pleased with his appearance. The big leather riding-boots that went\nwith the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\nfind one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite\nsatisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting\nand crept down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins,\nwhich I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of\nthe colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make\nan effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water\nfell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his\nleft shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed. The shock to his\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\ncould go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold. The only\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\nhad not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences\nmight have been very serious.\n\nHe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,\nand contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in\nlist slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\ndraughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the\ntwins. The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September. He\nhad gone down-stairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that\nthere, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing\nhimself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of\nthe United States Minister and his wife which had now taken the place of\nthe Canterville family pictures. He was simply but neatly clad in a long\nshroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip\nof yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In\nfact, he was dressed for the character of \"Jonas the Graveless, or the\nCorpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,\" one of his most remarkable\nimpersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to\nremember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their\nneighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a quarter-past two o'clock in\nthe morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring. As\nhe was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any\ntraces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a\ndark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads,\nand shrieked out \"BOO!\" in his ear.\n\nSeized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural,\nhe rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him\nthere with the big garden-syringe, and being thus hemmed in by his\nenemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the\ngreat iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to\nmake his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own\nroom in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.\n\nAfter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins\nlay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\nservants, but it was of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings\nwere so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed\nhis great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had\nbeen engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized a wonderful\nclam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse\neuchre, poker, and other American national games, and Virginia rode\nabout the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire,\nwho had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville\nChase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in\nfact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who,\nin reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best\ncongratulations to the Minister's worthy wife.\n\nThe Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the\nhouse, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let\nmatters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the\nyoung Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had\nonce bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice\nwith the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the\nfloor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state that, though\nhe lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but\n\"Double Sixes.\" The story was well known at the time, though, of course,\nout of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt\nwas made to hush it up, and a full account of all the circumstances\nconnected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle's\nRecollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends. The ghost, then,\nwas naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence\nover the Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his\nown first cousin having been married en secondes noces to the Sieur de\nBulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are\nlineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to\nVirginia's little lover in his celebrated impersonation of \"The Vampire\nMonk, or the Bloodless Benedictine,\" a performance so horrible that when\nold Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in\nthe year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which\nculminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after\ndisinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and\nleaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment,\nhowever, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the\nlittle Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal\nBedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.\n\n\nCHAPTER: V\n\n\nA few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out\nriding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting\nthrough a hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go\nup by the back staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past\nthe Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied\nshe saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother's maid, who\nsometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend\nher habit. To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville\nGhost himself! He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of\nthe yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing\nmadly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his hand, and his\nwhole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so forlorn, and so\nmuch out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea\nhad been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity,\nand determined to try and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so\ndeep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she\nspoke to him.\n\n\"I am so sorry for you,\" she said, \"but my brothers are going back to\nEton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy\nyou.\"\n\n\"It is absurd asking me to behave myself,\" he answered, looking round in\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,\n\"quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and\nwalk about at night, if that is what you mean. It is my only reason for\nexisting.\"\n\n\"It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very\nwicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had\nkilled your wife.\"\n\n\"Well, I quite admit it,\" said the Ghost, petulantly, \"but it was a\npurely family matter, and concerned no one else.\"\n\n\"It is very wrong to kill any one,\" said Virginia, who at times had a\nsweet puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.\n\n\"Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very\nplain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about\ncookery. Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent\npricket, and do you know how she had it sent to table? However, it is\nno matter now, for it is all over, and I don't think it was very nice of\nher brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.\"\n\n\"Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost--I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry? I\nhave a sandwich in my case. Would you like it?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you,\nall the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\nvulgar, dishonest family.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Virginia, stamping her foot, \"it is you who are rude, and\nhorrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the\npaints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain\nin the library. First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and\nI couldn't do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the\nchrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese\nwhite, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing\nto look at, and not at all easy to paint. I never told on you, though I\nwas very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for\nwho ever heard of emerald-green blood?\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" said the Ghost, rather meekly, \"what was I to do? It is\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother\nbegan it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I\nshould not have your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of\ntaste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest\nin England; but I know you Americans don't care for things of this\nkind.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\nand improve your mind. My father will be only too happy to give you a\nfree passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind,\nthere will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are\nall Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\nhave a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family ghost.\"\n\n\"I don't think I should like America.\"\n\n\"I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,\" said Virginia,\nsatirically.\n\n\"No ruins! no curiosities!\" answered the Ghost; \"you have your navy and\nyour manners.\"\n\n\"Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week's\nholiday.\"\n\n\"Please don't go, Miss Virginia,\" he cried; \"I am so lonely and so\nunhappy, and I really don't know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I\ncannot.\"\n\n\"That's quite absurd! You have merely to go to bed and blow out the\ncandle. It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\nchurch, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why, even\nbabies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.\"\n\n\"I have not slept for three hundred years,\" he said sadly, and\nVirginia's beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; \"for three hundred\nyears I have not slept, and I am so tired.\"\n\nVirginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like\nrose-leaves. She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked\nup into his old withered face.\n\n\"Poor, poor Ghost,\" she murmured; \"have you no place where you can\nsleep?\"\n\n\"Far away beyond the pine-woods,\" he answered, in a low, dreamy voice,\n\"there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\nsings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold crystal\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\nsleepers.\"\n\nVirginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\n\n\"You mean the Garden of Death,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth,\nwith the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have\nno yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at\npeace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of death's\nhouse, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death\nis.\"\n\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\nthere was silence. She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\n\nThen the ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of\nthe wind.\n\n\"Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?\"\n\n\"Oh, often,\" cried the little girl, looking up; \"I know it quite well.\n\nIt is painted in curious black letters, and is difficult to read. There\nare only six lines:\n    \"'When a golden girl can win\n    Prayer from out the lips of sin,\n    When the barren almond bears,\n    And a little child gives away its tears,\n    Then shall all the house be still\n    And peace come to Canterville.'\n\n\"But I don't know what they mean.\"\n\n\"They mean,\" he said, sadly, \"that you must weep with me for my sins,\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle,\nthe angel of death will have mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\ncannot prevail.\"\n\nVirginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair\nas he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes. \"I am not afraid,\" she said\nfirmly, \"and I will ask the angel to have mercy on you.\"\n\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as\nhe led her across the dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were\nbroidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back. \"Go back! little Virginia,\"\n\nthey cried, \"go back!\" but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly,\nand she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails\nand goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and\nmurmured, \"Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,\"\n\nbut the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When\nthey reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she\ncould not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly\nfading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A\nbitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her\ndress. \"Quick, quick,\" cried the Ghost, \"or it will be too late,\" and\nin a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry\nChamber was empty.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VI\n\n\nAbout ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not\ncome down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia\nanywhere. As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\nevening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all\nalarmed at first, but when six o'clock struck, and Virginia did not\nappear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for\nher, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house. At\nhalf-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\nof their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of\nexcitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly\nremembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies\npermission to camp in the park. He accordingly at once set off for\nBlackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son\nand two of the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire, who was\nperfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too,\nbut Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a\nscuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gipsies had\ngone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as\nthe fire was still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.\n\nHaving sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran\nhome, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the\ncounty, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been\nkidnapped by tramps or gipsies. He then ordered his horse to be brought\nround, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down\nto dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with a groom. He had hardly,\nhowever, gone a couple of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after\nhim, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with\nhis face very flushed, and no hat. \"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,\" gasped\nout the boy, \"but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.\n\nPlease don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year,\nthere would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me back,\nwill you? I can't go! I won't go!\"\n\nThe Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace,\nand was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down\nfrom his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, \"Well,\nCecil, if you won't go back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must\nget you a hat at Ascot.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!\" cried the little Duke, laughing,\nand they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of\nthe station-master if any one answering to the description of Virginia\nhad been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her. The\nstation-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him\nthat a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a\nhat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his\nshutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away,\nwhich he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as there was a\nlarge common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman, but\ncould get no information from him, and, after riding all over the\ncommon, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase\nabout eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found\nWashington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with\nlanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest trace of\nVirginia had been discovered. The gipsies had been caught on Brockley\nmeadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they should be late. Indeed, they had\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's disappearance, as they\nwere very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his\npark, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search.\n\nThe carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone\nover, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any\nrate, Virginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest\ndepression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they\nfound a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\nwas poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and\nhaving her forehead bathed with eau de cologne by the old housekeeper.\n\nMr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up\nsupper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one\nspoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very\nfond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the\nentreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that\nnothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in\nthe morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down\nimmediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight\nbegan to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded\nthey heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder\nshook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a\npanel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out\non the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her\nhand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs.\nOtis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with\nviolent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.\n\n\"Good heavens! child, where have you been?\" said Mr. Otis, rather\nangrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them.\n\n\"Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and\nyour mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these\npractical jokes any more.\"\n\n\"Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!\" shrieked the twins, as they\ncapered about.\n\n\"My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side\nagain,\" murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair.\n\n\"Papa,\" said Virginia, quietly, \"I have been with the Ghost. He is dead,\nand you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was\nreally sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of\nbeautiful jewels before he died.\"\n\nThe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave\nand serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a\nlighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they\ncame to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia\ntouched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves\nin a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated\nwindow. Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was\na gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone\nfloor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers\nan old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its\nreach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was\ncovered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but\na pile of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding\nher little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the\nparty looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\ndisclosed to them.\n\n\"Hallo!\" suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out\nof the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\nsituated. \"Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.\"\n\n\"God has forgiven him,\" said Virginia, gravely, as she rose to her feet,\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.\n\n\"What an angel you are!\" cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round\nher neck, and kissed her.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VII\n\n\nFour days after these curious incidents, a funeral started from\nCanterville Chase at about eleven o'clock at night. The hearse was drawn\nby eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\nnodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\npurple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville\ncoat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\nservants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully\nimpressive. Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up\nspecially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first\ncarriage along with little Virginia. Then came the United States\nMinister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the\nlast carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had\nbeen frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she\nhad a right to see the last of him. A deep grave had been dug in the\ncorner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service\nwas read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, the servants, according to an old custom\nobserved in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as\nthe coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward,\nand laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms. As\nshe did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its\nsilent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a\nnightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of the\nGarden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a\nword during the drive home.\n\nThe next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given\nto Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby\nnecklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen\nof sixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis\nfelt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"I know that in this country mortmain is held to\napply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that\nthese jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg\nyou, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you\nunder certain strange conditions. As for my daughter, she is merely a\nchild, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such\nappurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I\nmay say, is no mean authority upon Art,--having had the privilege of\nspending several winters in Boston when she was a girl,--that these gems\nare of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\nprice. Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you\nwill recognize how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\nin the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such\nvain gauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\nBritish aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who\nhave been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles\nof Republican simplicity. Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box, as a memento of\nyour unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is extremely old, and\nconsequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to\ncomply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good deal\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with medi\u00e6valism\nin any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was\nborn in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned\nfrom a trip to Athens.\"\n\nLord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister's speech,\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile,\nand when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\nsaid: \"My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky\nancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are\nmuch indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck. The jewels\nare clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough\nto take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave\nin a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. As for their being\nheirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or\nlegal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite\nunknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and\nwhen Miss Virginia grows up, I dare say she will be pleased to have\npretty things to wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the\nfurniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to\nthe ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity\nSir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he\nwas really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase.\"\n\nMr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville's refusal, and\nbegged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was\nquite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to\nretain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of\n1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's first\ndrawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the\nuniversal theme of admiration. For Virginia received the coronet, which\nis the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her\nboy-lover as soon as he came of age. They were both so charming, and\nthey loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the\nmatch, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch\nthe Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less\nthan three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to\nsay, Mr. Otis himself. Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke\npersonally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his\nown words, \"was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating\ninfluences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of\nRepublican simplicity should be forgotten.\" His objections, however,\nwere completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the\naisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his\narm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of\nEngland.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to\nCanterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over\nin the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods. There had\nbeen a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir\nSimon's tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it\nsimply the initials of the old gentleman's name, and the verse from the\nlibrary window. The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses,\nwhich she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for\nsome time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There\nthe Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her\nfeet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly\nhe threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her,\n\"Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.\"\n\n\"Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have,\" he answered, smiling, \"you have never told me what\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.\"\n\n\"I have never told any one, Cecil,\" said Virginia, gravely.\n\n\"I know that, but you might tell me.\"\n\n\"Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you. Poor Sir Simon! I owe\nhim a great deal. Yes, don't laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see\nwhat Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than\nboth.\"\n\nThe Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.\n\n\"You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,\" he murmured.\n\n\"You have always had that, Cecil.\"\n\n\"And you will tell our children some day, won't you?\"\n\nVirginia blushed.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.\n\nYet Millet would have us understand that in spite of this, the\nshepherd is performing a duty to humanity not to be underrated. The\nsheep he has so carefully and conscientiously reared will form food\nto-morrow for many a hungry town-dweller. Further, he would have us\nfollow the peasant as he closes the pen for the night and traces his\ntired steps towards his simple home in the village. The frugal and\nhard-earned meal, prepared for him by his wife, who like himself has\nhad her share of duties to occupy her during the day, is partaken of\nsurrounded by a hungry and joyous group of children. Such themes\nsuggested by the simplicity of his own life appealed to him with\nirresistible force, and it is in their portrayal that his greatness is\nmanifested.\n\nPerhaps no season of the year presented the same attraction for Millet\nas the spring. The period when all the earth after its long winter\nsleep is about to waken into new life seems to have always been a\nsource of inspiration to him. In \"The Sower\" he emphasises the fact\nthat the fruits of the harvest are not to be had without due labour\nbeing expended upon the earth. The sloping field, barren of\nvegetation, and crowned at the top with a small clump of trees, is\nbeing broken up by the distant plough drawn by two horses and guided\nby a peasant. The latter figure is one of the noblest of Millet's\ncreations. By his strained and ever-attentive attitude, by his\ncontinuous tramp over the rough and broken ground, he shows us the\nmonotony of his toil. He crosses the field in one direction, only to\nreturn at an interval of a few feet. In the foreground we have the\nsower, a middle-aged man of typical peasant type, on whose left side a\nbag of seeds is slung. With automatic precision he withdraws a\nhandful, and strews it into the furrows open to receive it. So long as\nhe continues in the same track his labour will be well performed, and\nhence his task is just as monotonous as that of his fellow-worker\nhigher up in the field. The silhouetting of these two figures against\nthe light is symbolical of the labour to be expended in life before\nresults are forthcoming.\n\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that in considering the works of\nMillet, one must not judge him from the standpoint of a mere painter.\n\nHis brush is only the means to an end, and by its means he is enabled\nto bring the fruits of his philosophic observation before us in\npermanent form. It has been charged against the \"Angelus\" that it was\nnot a remarkably fine piece of painting, that many a young artist of\nthe present generation is infinitely better equipped, technically\nspeaking, than the master who wrought this celebrated canvas. This may\nin a measure be true, but it must never be forgotten that Millet\nbrought into play exactly the means which could illustrate his meaning\nin the clearest terms. He had not intended, in painting such a\npicture, to produce a work which would astonish his fellow artists\nwith its brilliancy of handling or magnificence of colour. He wanted\nto make the beholder forget the painter and absorb the lesson. This\nquality runs right through the art of Millet, and it is from this\nstandpoint that we are obliged to weigh his merits.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE\n\n\nJean Fran\u00e7ois Millet was born on October 4, 1814, that is at the\nperiod when French art, at any rate as far as landscape painting is\nconcerned, had reached its lowest ebb. Throughout the eighteenth\ncentury the landscape painter had been hard put to make a living. The\ntaste of connoisseurs throughout the century had been for portraits\nand interiors, or for those numerous pastoral subjects which were\ncarried out with so much decorative charm by such men as Watteau and\nBoucher. Such landscape painting as existed was of the type\npopularised by Vernet; it was built upon a curious mixture of Italian\ninfluence coming from Panini and Salvator Rosa. The only evidence of\nrevolt against such a state of affairs we find in the works of Hubert\nRobert and Moreau. These two, and more especially would I direct the\nreader's attention to the latter, struggled hard to break down the\nconventionalities of the time. They endeavoured to infuse some sense\nof atmosphere into their pictures, and whilst frequently their trees\nand figures are painfully formal, they yet stand alone in the French\nschool as the pioneers of a phase of art which was to attain its\nzenith in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBut after the Revolution, and during the whole of the time that France\nwas under the domination of Napoleon, very rigid principles indeed\nwere enforced with regard to the direction that art should take. The\ninnovation which had its commencement in the reign of Louis XVI. swept\neverything before it as it gained force. Classical art and traditions\ndominated the whole French school, and no artist, however great his\nreputation, attempted for many years to swim against the stream. In\nspite of the principles of liberty and equality which were claimed for\nall under the new r\u00e9gime, a terribly strict eye was kept upon any\ninnovations which might break out in the form of a naturalistic art.\n\nThe directors of this new movement failed to see that the conditions\nwhich had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed\naway, and that the latter's supremacy was due to the fact that their\nproductions were symbolical of the loftiest thoughts of their own\nepoch. The art which expresses the ambitions and noblest thoughts of\nits time will alone endure. These expressions are not applicable to\nany other condition than those which called them forth, and hence in\nattempting to purify the rococo which had existed up to the middle of\nthe eighteenth century, by a return to classical traditions, they were\nonly copying that which their predecessors had done, and in so doing\nleft us without any original expression of their own time.\n\nInto such a condition of affairs was Millet born, and he was numbered\namongst that little band of men which included Rousseau, Corot, Dupr\u00e9,\nDiaz, and Daumier, who were to lay the foundations of the modern\nnaturalistic school. At the outset it was seemingly a hopeless\nstruggle they undertook; a struggle against prejudice and influence\nwhich was only to be brought to a victorious culmination after years\nof struggle and disappointment. Of this little band, Millet was\nperhaps the best equipped for the privations which were necessary. He\ncame of a peasant stock who inhabited Gruchy, a small village\nsituated in the commune of Gr\u00e9ville, close to Cherbourg. Grouped\nunderneath the humble roof was the grandmother, who had been left a\nwidow fifteen years before; her son, Jean Louis Nicolas Millet, and\nhis wife and eight children, of which our artist was the second. His\ngrandmother appears to have been a pious old lady, whose chief delight\nwas in her grandchildren, to whom she taught those religious\nprinciples which stood them in good stead in after life. We are told\nthat Millet's father possessed a force of character one does not often\nfind amongst men in his rank of life. He was of a contemplative\ndisposition, and had a keenly developed feeling for natural beauty. He\npossessed moreover a keen appreciation of music, which unfortunately\nhe does not appear to have had much opportunity of cultivating. His\nwife was an excellent housewife and of a religious turn of mind. The\nhouse they occupied, situated quite a short distance from the sea, was\nplaced in a tract of country which, whilst it had rugged and\npicturesque features, was not of a nature which would yield\nextraordinary results under cultivation. It was, therefore, a hard\nstruggle for existence which Millet in his first years saw going\non around him. Not that the family were any the less happy for having\nto work laboriously for their livelihood. They had been brought up\namidst such surroundings; their wants were simple and easily\ngratified, and the tranquillity of the m\u00e9nage more than\ncounterbalanced those doubtful luxuries which easier circumstances\nwould have brought their way. Throughout his life Millet maintained\nthe extreme simplicity he had seen practised in the home of his\nchildhood, and long years afterwards he was accustomed to look back\nwith pleasureable memories upon his early years.\n\nGruchy, situated in one of the wildest parts of Normandy, feels the\nfull effect of every storm which blows up from the Atlantic. There is\nnothing to shelter the exposed hamlets studded along the coast from\nthe fury of the western gale, and the rocks are but too often strewn\nwith the wrecks of vessels which have come to grief in that terrible\nsea. Millet in his youth must have witnessed many of these\ncatastrophes. Quite a number of drawings by him are extant\nrepresenting succour being extended to some vessel in difficulties, or\nthe hauling up of some wreckage on to the rocks. The studious boy\nmust have been impressed as he saw the sternness of the combat in his\nnative country between men and nature; the wind-swept fields, and\nhills bare to the point of savageness. The very trees themselves\ndwarfed and gnarled; in their struggle with the elements they have\nbeen made tough and hardy as the inhabitants of the country\nthemselves, and, stunted as they are, yet show well that they can\nresist the force of the fiercest storm. The brooding and contemplative\ncharacter of the father having descended to the son, we can quite\nimagine the effect such surroundings would have upon him. As he looked\nback in after years upon his roamings in his native country, he\nappreciated the awe-inspiring character of the scenery in which he had\nbeen born. He would doubtless recall many a walk amidst the fields\nwith the wind blowing in his face as it rushed in from the Atlantic,\nthe rain beating hard upon the freshly ploughed fields, and the\ndistant figure of the ploughman struggling hard with his team against\nthe stiff sou'wester. The great mass of vapour overhead whirled before\nthe violence of the storm, casting grey and pearly light over the\nwhole scene, whilst far away on the top of the hill a clump of trees,\nbent with their resistance to the wind, are silhouetted against the\nsky. Many a drawing of this kind we encounter in the later work of\nMillet, which shows how his thoughts harked back in certain moments to\nthe scenes he had left behind him for ever.\n\nWe know that on one or two occasions he returned to Gruchy. Once or\ntwice he had urgent business which took him back, but sometimes he\nwent with no other purpose than to renew acquaintance with the scenes\nof yore.\n\nLittle Jean Fran\u00e7ois was his grandmother's favourite. It was she who\ntaught him the names of things which surrounded him, and perhaps\ndirected his thoughts in the channels to which they were finally to be\ndevoted. Her brother Charles, who formed one of the family, used to\ntake him for walks, telling him stories on the way. Millet was\ndevotedly attached to this old man, and when at the age of seven years\nhe lost him, the gap in his life thus left made an impression upon his\nmemory never to be effaced.\n\nFive years afterwards he was placed in the hands of the vicar for the\npurpose of preparing him for his first communion. The good man seems\nto have been taken with the child; he found him so attentive to all\nnatural phenomenon which was passing around him and intelligent in an\nunusual degree. He quickly learnt a considerable amount of Latin,\nwhich introduced him to the great classics. Unfortunately for Millet,\nthe vicar accepted an offer of transference to a better parish in the\nvicinity. The boy had made such progress with his master that it was\ndecided that he should go with him to his new abode. He was, however,\nso missed in his own home, that when he came back for his first\nholidays it was decided that he should not return.\n\nHe now gave serious attention to the agricultural pursuits of his\nfather. He threw himself heartily into the work of the farm, and\nassisted in the work of sowing and harvesting, of pruning and\nthrashing according to the season. His spare time was occupied in\nreading with avidity various masterpieces of literature. The authors\nhe found at hand were such as F\u00e9n\u00e9lon and Bossuet, but he developed a\ndecided preference, which lasted till the end of his life, for Virgil\nand the Bible.\n\nIt was at this time that his taste for art began to be developed.\n\nHe drew the objects he found around him, and soon acquired sufficient\nconfidence in his skill to execute a large drawing representing two\nshepherds keeping guard over their sheep. These first efforts date\nfrom about his seventeenth year, and foretell the advent of the style\nin which he was later to become pre-eminent.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE MIGRATION TO PARIS\n\n\nHow frequently has it happened that the first years in the life of a\ngenius have been employed in labour quite different from that to which\nthey should have been directed. Such a state of affairs the more often\noccurs when the sense of duty has been strong enough to overcome\ntemporarily the inclination to pursue the natural bent. In the case of\nMillet, however, the early years which he devoted to the farm and its\npursuits were by no means wasted. It is on record that he became very\nproficient in the various duties in which he was engaged, but at the\nsame time we can be quite sure that his extraordinary faculties of\nobservation were constantly being brought into play, and the fruits of\nhis observations are to be seen in the pictures of his mature period.\n\nA considerable portion of his spare time was taken up with drawing,\nnot only the persons and objects he found around him, but also\nsubjects suggested to him by the books he was in the habit of reading.\n\nHis family, so far from throwing any obstacles in his way, encouraged\nhim. In fact it was his father who took him first to Cherbourg in\norder to show a painter of that town, named Mouchel, the early\nproducts of his son's genius. The decision at which Millet p\u00e8re had\narrived was prompted by a drawing in charcoal of an old peasant\nwalking along the road, which had struck him forcibly as being a work\nof extraordinary merit. It says much for Mouchel's breadth of mind\nthat he was equally impressed with the drawings. A man who had been\nbrought up in the school of David, and who had lived in one of the\nmost reactionary periods of French art, was hardly to be expected to\ntake kindly to a style so diametrically opposed to all the traditions\ninto which he himself had been inculcated; certainly the young\nMillet, who had now arrived at the age of eighteen, had not developed\nthe extraordinary freedom which his works of ten years later\ndemonstrate. But there was sufficient originality even in his early\ndrawings to call forth condemnation from a man who had been so\nsaturated with the teaching of David.\n\nHe prevailed upon Millet to leave his son with him, and set him to\nwork to copy many well-known works of art which he brought before his\npupil by means of engravings. Two months were spent in this way when\nnews reached Millet that his father had been seized with sudden\nillness, and he was obliged in the circumstances to return to\nGr\u00e9ville. He arrived to find the old man unconscious, and very shortly\nafterwards he died.\n\nThis misfortune awoke in Millet a sense of duty which compelled him to\ndesert his studies in Cherbourg and superintend the management of the\nfarm. For some time he devoted himself entirely to his new duties, but\nthe struggle betwixt duty and genius continued; he gave himself to his\nwork with all the energy at his disposal, but his thoughts were ever\nwandering to his art.\n\nAdded to his own inclinations, his grandmother, who perceived his\nextraordinary gifts, strongly persuaded him to devote his attention\nentirely to art, and consequently after some little time he decided to\nreturn to Cherbourg. Here he entered the studio of M. Langlois, an\nartist whose reputation in the town was considerable. Again in this\nworthy man he came in contact with a painter who had been brought up\nentirely under classical influence. Langlois, who had in his early\ndays been a pupil of Gros, had absorbed the classical tradition to\nsuch an extent as to be incapable of appreciating any other style. He\nappears to have endeavoured to mould Millet in his own method rather\nthan develop the latent genius which the latter possessed. The\nincompatibility of these two men speedily caused the younger to strike\nout in his own way. He saw more good in frequenting the museums and\nmaking copies of such works as appealed to him than in listening to\nthe advice of his teacher. All this occurred, however, without any\nbreach of friendship occurring. On the contrary, Langlois, after\nperceiving the futility of inducing his pupil to follow in his\nfootsteps, did all he could to advance his interests.\n\nBy means of his influence some of Millet's drawings were brought\nbefore the Municipal Council, and Langlois suggested that Millet\nshould be sent to Paris in order to further his development, and that\nthe Council should set aside a modest pension to meet his requirements\nin that city. The discussion appears to have been very prolonged, and\nupon the question being put to a vote it was only carried by means of\nthe casting vote of the mayor. Four hundred francs was at first\nallotted to him in this way, which was further increased shortly\nafterwards to six hundred. Such encouragement, meagre though it was,\nwas sufficient to give him a foothold in the metropolis. He left\nCherbourg in January 1837, on a cold and raw day, the snow falling\nheavily throughout the entire journey, and arrived in Paris in a very\ndisheartened condition. The miserable weather, coupled with the long\njourney in which he had had time to think of the small sum which lay\nbetween him and starvation, going to a city which he had never seen\nbefore, had all served to work upon his nerves, and he entered the\ngreat city sick at heart and very despondent.\n\nOne of the first visits he made after he was somewhat settled down in\nParis was to the Louvre. Here he was brought into contact for the\nfirst time with many masters, who were to mould his yet plastic\ntemperament into the form which enabled him to give to the world, in\nlater years, so many masterpieces. As I have said before, it was\nMantegna who first captivated him, and the influence of the mighty\nPaduan was never finally to be shaken off. Michel Angelo awed him with\nhis sublimity; his classical severity tempered with intense humanism,\nhis masculine strength, were bound to have their effect upon so\nserious a character as Millet. Strange as it may seem to those who are\nbut superficially acquainted with his art, and are only too apt to\njudge him by the influence he has had upon modern French painting, he\nwas fascinated with the antique. The traditions of Phidias and\nPraxiteles, in the form in which they had been transmitted through the\ngreatest minds of the Renaissance, were ever the factors which guided\nhim throughout his career. It was this same spirit which impelled his\nfervid admiration for Nicolas Poussin, a master who to-day is sadly\nunderrated and but little understood. It was the mysteries of line,\nthe wonders of pose and composition rather than the magic of colour\nwhich appealed to him. He had a profound admiration for the glowing\ncanvases of Titian and Rubens, but he could never overlook entirely\ntheir defects of drawing or, in the case of Rubens, the tendency to\nvulgarity. From his remarks in after years it would appear that he was\nbaffled with the mysticisms of Velazquez and Rembrandt; pure painting\nitself could never hold him. He needed to grasp the message which lay\nbehind it before he felt fully taken into the confidence of the\npainter; and as the minds of the Dutchman and the Spaniard ran in\nquite different channels to his own, they spoke with a language he\nnever understood. That he had a perceptive and critically independent\nmind may be gauged from his enthusiasm for Delacroix, whose work he\nencountered for the first time at the Luxembourg.\n\nDuring this period of study he was carefully considering under what\nmaster he should place himself. His choice unhappily fell upon\nDelaroche. To any one acquainted with the work of the latter master,\na more unsuitable selection could not have been made. Delaroche and\nthe painters who surrounded him can be appropriately described as\nconstituting the back-wash of the Empire style, which had reached its\nclimax with David. His subjects were always treated with academic\nreserve. No pyrotechnics were permitted; on the contrary, an\neverlasting and mistaken striving for finish was encouraged:\noriginality was sternly suppressed. To paint human life as it really\nwas, was too vulgar for any of the painters of this time. They held\nthe public taste enslaved for years. An innovator such as Millet was\ndestined to become found his position almost untenable. The band of\ncritics and painters formed a monopoly which it seemed almost\nimpossible to break down, and it was only after years of bitter and\ndetermined struggle that the school of nature finally routed its\nopponent.\n\nDelaroche doubtlessly found the peasant painter a little rude both in\nhis person and in his ideas about art. He paid but little attention to\nthe young man who had placed himself in his hands, and devoted all his\ntime to students who were more amenable to his influence. A\ntemperament so sensitive as Millet's was bound to notice this\nneglect, and consequently after a time he became so discouraged that\nhe ceased to frequent Delaroche's studio. Another very good reason for\nthis action was the lack of resources to continue his payments. Even\nduring the time he had been with Delaroche he lost no opportunity of\nturning a few honest francs by painting the portraits of any who could\nbe got to sit to him. Delaroche, however, had a more kindly heart than\nMillet imagined. He seems to have found out the real distress of the\nyoung artist, and to have assisted him pecuniarily in many ways, and\nthere is no doubt that he appreciated the talent of the young Norman\nmuch more than he cared to own. Many of his remarks on record would\nserve to show that Delaroche already felt that his pupil was destined\nto be one of the leaders of the movement which was finally to\noverthrow his own style, and doubtlessly felt a great admiration for a\nman who had the courage and strength to swim against rather than with\nthe current.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STRUGGLE FOR RECOGNITION\n\n\nFreed from all encumbrances save poverty, Millet was now to work out\nhis own destiny according to the dictates of his genius. He joined a\nfriend named Marolle, and the two together occupying a very small\napartment endeavoured to eke out an existence. It was only too soon\napparent that young as he was, and the taste of the public being not\nyet ready for development upon the lines his genius directed him, that\nhis livelihood could not be secured by endeavouring to sell such\nsubjects as appealed to him. In these straits he turned to\nportrait-painting, just as many great painters before and since him\nhave done. That the struggle was very keen can well be imagined by the\nfact that he was unable to obtain more than five to ten francs apiece;\nand, as commissions were very scarce, he was hard put to gain the\nmeans of subsistence. This state of affairs lasted until 1840, in\nwhich year he endeavoured to obtain admission to the Salon with two\nportraits, one of which was that of his friend. This, however, was\nrejected, and the other picture, although accepted, was unnoticed by\neither the critics or the public.\n\nHaving occasion the next year to pay a visit to Cherbourg, he felt\nobliged to report himself to the Municipal Council who had had the\ngenerosity to send him in the first place to Paris. Its worthy members\nexpressed themselves as but little satisfied with the result of their\ninvestment; they claimed that they had had as yet but little to show\nfor their money, and they suggested, partly as a means of\ndemonstrating that they had had some little return, and also, in order\nto see of what stuff their prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was made, that he should paint a\nportrait of the recently deceased mayor. As Millet had not been\npersonally acquainted with that worthy citizen, and as the only guide\nwhich could be supplied him was a portrait made in miniature when he\nwas a young man of some twenty-three or twenty-four years of age, the\ntask was by no means easy. However, the artist set to work with a\nwill, and finally accomplished the picture to his own satisfaction.\n\nUpon it being shown to the Council, one and all declared, as any one\nwith the slightest knowledge of such matters could have told them\nbefore it was commenced, that it bore not the least resemblance to the\ndefunct magistrate. They therefore demurred at the three hundred\nfrancs they had agreed to pay him for the portrait, and offered him\none-third of that amount instead. Millet was deeply offended by the\ninsult, and informed the Council that he made them a present of the\npicture.\n\nIt was during this short visit to his native country that he met his\nfirst wife, a Mlle. Ono, whose portrait he had painted. From the first\nshe was very delicate, and he lost her after much suffering, three\nyears later. His second wife was Mlle. Catherine Lemaire, who was\ndestined to be the companion of his struggles until the end of his\nlife.\n\nMeanwhile Millet was occupied with subjects which he thought would\nappeal to the general public. A number of classical pictures date from\nthis epoch. It was an endeavour on his part to fall in as far as\npossible with the current taste, and so supply means of subsistence\nfor his family. At the same time he did not neglect his favourite\nsubjects, and many are the wonderful studies of peasant life which\ndate from these years. His reputation had so far advanced that he was\noffered the position of teacher of drawing in the college at\nCherbourg. It must have been only after prolonged deliberation that he\nrefused the proffered post. Here a certain annual stipend was assured\nhim, and if it was not large in itself it would at any rate suffice to\nkeep the wolf from the door. He preferred, however, to return to Paris\nand work out his own destiny as best he might.\n\nMillet, who lived at this time in the Rue Rochechouart, began to\nsurround himself with that little group of friends who remained\nfaithful to him until the end of his career. Amongst the earliest were\nCharles Jacque and Diaz: the latter had several clients amongst the\nsmall dealers, whom he induced to visit Millet's studio and make now\nand again a small purchase.\n\nMillet now became a fairly regular contributor to the Salon, but\ngenerally sent some classical or religious picture as well as one of\nhis peasant subjects. For example, in 1848 he sent the marvellous\nstudy of \"The Winnower,\" which we all know so well, accompanied by a\ncanvas, \"The Captivity of the Jews at Babylon.\" The latter, however,\nwas so badly received that he utilised the canvas upon its return for\na large picture of a \"Shepherdess tending her Sheep.\"\n\nIn spite of the headway that he was making, the struggle for existence\nseemed keener than ever, and but for the kindness of friends he and\nhis family would frequently have actually wanted for food. A timely\nadvance of one hundred francs obtained for him from the Minister of\nFine Arts, together with a commission from the State, for which he was\npaid the sum of eighteen hundred francs, were for some time the only\nrelief he obtained from his embarrassments. That he was not particular\nas to how he earned his daily bread is apparent from the fact that he\ndid not despise an order for a shop sign for a midwife, for which he\nwas paid the miserable amount of thirty francs.\n\nThe year 1848 was not an encouraging one for a painter who was\nstanding on the threshold of his career. The whole of Europe was\nseething with revolution. A repetition of the fearful year of 1792 was\neverywhere expected. The struggle betwixt reaction and property on the\none hand, and lawlessness and revolution on the other, was being waged\nwith grim determination. The issue was for long in the balance. One\nnever knew from one day to another what was going to happen. In such a\ndeplorable state of affairs men's minds were running on politics and\nwars rather than upon art. Millet amongst the rest was called upon to\nshoulder the musket, and it can be easily imagined with what\nreluctance he did so.\n\nParis, the great centre of art, had yet not afforded him much\nencouragement. Life was dear in the big city, and surrounded on all\nsides by bricks and mortar he was not free to go out into the fields\nand study the objects which were uppermost in his mind. He resolved to\nescape from it, and once having put the plan into execution he never\nreturned.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET IN HIS MATURITY\n\n\nThe Barbizon of 1850 was a very different place from the Barbizon of\nto-day. The world fame of the men who passed a quiet and strenuous\nexistence in the little village has transformed it into a tourist\nresort, with restaurants and caf\u00e9s, the stopping-places for\nwaggonettes which in summer bring their daily load of sightseers,\neager to see the homes of the painters whose names are now household\nwords.\n\nIt would have been well-nigh impossible for the little band to have\nchosen a more suitable spot for their labours. Rousseau and Millet,\nmuch as they were drawn towards each other by the tie of a sympathetic\ndisposition and by their common interest in art, yet were widely\ndissimilar from one another in their outlook upon art and their\nmethods of worship at the common shrine. Rousseau--one can see it from\nevery picture he painted--loved with all the yearning of a passionate\nand restless temperament the inanimate in Nature. Observe with what\nfidelity he draws his trees, with what caressing tenderness his clouds\nand skies are treated; solitude appealed to him above all things, and\nif here and there he was obliged to insert a few figures to complete\nhis composition, one instinctively feels that he would rather have\nsubstituted a group of cattle or a flock of sheep. In the glades of\nthe forest, far from the busy haunts of men, with the glorious\nsunlight penetrating from above, the breeze moaning through the\nbranches, he was happy. A wild and turbulent temperament such as his\nnot infrequently discovers exquisite enjoyment amidst such perfect\ntranquillity.\n\nBarbizon, situated on the fringe of the great forest of Fontainebleau,\ntherefore, permitted Rousseau to come into daily contact with the\nscenes which so appealed to him.\n\nMillet, on the other hand, was absorbed in the peasant. The man who\ntilled the soil and raised the produce humanity requires for its\nsubsistence by the sweat of his brow; the manifold duties of the\nlabourer, his life and sorrows, appealed to him with irresistible\nforce. An unpeopled track of wild and uncultivated land would not call\nforth any emotion in him, no matter how sublime the scenery might be.\n\nThe life of the village, spreading itself into the vast and fertile\nplain behind, held him absorbed; a peasant himself and living amongst\nthe people he so loved, he was in a position to bring before an\nunthinking world the poignant monotony of their useful lives.\n\nUpon their first arrival at Barbizon, the two artists put up at a\nsmall inn, working all day in a tiny place they had rented from some\npeasants and fitted up as a studio. The inconveniences of this\narrangement were soon apparent, and shortly afterwards Millet took a\nsmall house which was destined to be his abode for the remainder of\nhis life; an old barn in the immediate vicinity meanwhile provided him\nwith an excellent studio.\n\nFrom this period onward we must date the greatest productions of the\nmaster, the works which have induced more thought than those of any\nother peasant painter. A peasant among peasants, his life was of the\nmost rigid simplicity. Behind his little abode a large garden\nstretched away almost to the fringe of the forest itself, and here he\nwas accustomed to work every morning, growing a portion of the food\nnecessary to the sustenance of his family. The afternoon he devoted to\npainting, whilst the evening was given over to intercourse with his\nlittle circle of friends. The simplicity and tranquillity of his life\naroused the whole of his powers to action, and surrounded with\neverything he valued in life he was supremely happy.\n\nThe country around Barbizon appealed to him irresistibly. The\ntimber-studded plains, the gently undulating, highly cultivated\nfields, presented a strange contrast to the wild and rugged country\namidst which he had spent his childhood, and no doubt conduced to the\ndevelopment of a more refined and contemplative style than he would\notherwise have acquired. Upon his few visits to his native country he\nappears to have been more impressed than ever with its austerity, and\nthe drawings which these journeys called forth bore ample evidence of\nthis feeling in him.\n\nLack of the necessary funds to carry on even his simple m\u00e9nage was\never the bane of Millet's life. On many occasions Sensier, his\nintimate friend and afterwards his biographer, informs us he dissuaded\nhim from suicide.\n\nThe sums that he owed, small though they were, rendered him in\nconstant fear of the brokers. With creditors so importunate in their\ndemands for satisfaction, and with the constant lack of recognition,\nwhich was his lot, it is astonishing that Millet achieved so much. He\nwas relieved more than once by the kind-hearted and ever faithful\nRousseau, who when his friend was sorest pressed found some delicately\nhidden means to relieve him. It was he who acquired for 4000 francs\nthe wonderful \"Peasant grafting a Tree,\" when the picture failed to\nfind a purchaser; and in order that Millet should not be aware of his\ngenerosity, he made the offer in the name of an imaginary American.\n\nThis sort of goodness he repeated more than once, and it redounds\nstill more to his credit when we remember that Rousseau himself was\nnot infrequently in pecuniary difficulties.\n\nA constant succession of important works made their appearance during\nthe first ten years Millet spent at Barbizon. The first was the\nwell-known \"Sower,\" which has ever been one of the most popular of his\npictures. Then came the far finer \"Peasants going to Work,\" which for\nmany years was in an English Collection. The \"Gleaners,\" perhaps the\nnoblest canvas the master ever painted, dates from 1857, in which year\nit was seen at the Salon; the celebrated \"Angelus\" followed it two\nyears later. The prices which Millet obtained for this series of\nremarkable works was fantastically small. The \"Gleaners\" brought him a\npaltry 2000 francs, whilst he accounted himself lucky to encounter an\namateur who gave him the same sum for the small \"Woman feeding Fowls.\"\n\nThe \"Angelus,\" which was never exhibited, was sold in the year it was\npainted to a Monsieur Feydeau, an architect, for 1800 francs. It then\npassed through several hands before the late Monsieur Secr\u00e9tan\ncompeted up to 160,000 francs before he became possessed of the prize\nat the John Wilson sale.\n\nThe purchase, however, proved a sound investment, for upon the\ndispersal of his collection it was knocked down for 553,000 francs to\na Monsieur Proust, acting on behalf of the French Government. The\nlatter, however, when they gave the commission to buy the picture, had\nno idea that such a high value would be placed upon it, and\nconsequently refused to ratify the sale; a syndicate now came upon the\nscene, who took it to America. The price, however, proved greater than\neven the millionaires of the States were prepared to give, and the\ncanvas again returned to France, where it found a resting-place in the\ncollection of Monsieur Chauchard, who paid the enormous sum of 800,000\nfrancs for its possession.\n\nIn 1859 Millet sent two works to the Salon, a \"Woman grazing her Cow,\"\nand \"Death and the Woodman.\" The latter, one of the most\nphilosophical of Millet's pictures, which to-day is the principal\nattraction of the Jacobsen Museum at Copenhagen, was rejected.\n\nDisappointments of this kind came with such systematic regularity to\nthe painter that he must have become proof against them. He always had\nbitter enemies amongst the critics, who never failed to pour abuse\nupon his method and his subjects. Even a number of his fellow artists\njoined in the chorus of disapproval. But the vehemence with which he\nwas attacked was striking evidence of the impression he was making and\nthe inward sense of his own powers; and the fact that he was working\nout his destiny according to the dictates of his own genius supported\nhim against this outpouring of prejudice and malice. The social side\nof life appealed to him more strongly as the years rolled on, and the\nmurmurings which had been heard in 1859 as to the socialistic\ntendencies of \"Death and the Woodman\" swelled to a roar when the\nstupendous \"Man with the Hoe\" was exhibited fourteen years later. The\nlatter, one of the most virile studies of depraved humanity which the\nworld has ever seen, has always been a favourite with social\nreformers, and has inspired one remarkable poem. Even his most\nimplacable critics were disarmed before this canvas; its power was\nmagnetic; it was an inspiration, soul moving and trenchant.\n\nHis financial difficulties never completely dispersed. At one time, in\norder to insure himself a little tranquillity, he made a contract with\ntwo speculators, whereby they were to become possessors of all the\nwork he produced for three years, in consideration of their assuring\nhim a thousand francs a month. A great number of Millet's finest\nproductions passed thus through their hands, including the \"Return\nfrom the Fields\" and the \"Man with the Hoe.\" The partners were not\nlong in quarrelling, and after a lawsuit had been fought, Millet was\nleft in the hands of a man who frequently would not or could not pay\nhim in ready money, and whose bills he was frequently forced to\ndiscount at considerable loss.\n\nOne little gleam of sunshine rendered his later days happy. This was a\ncommission from a Colmar banker, Monsieur Thomas by name, who required\nfour allegorical compositions representing the Seasons, to decorate\nhis rooms. The artist was overjoyed by this piece of good fortune,\nand immediately commenced a most conscientious study of such mural\ndecoration as was within reach, in order that he might do full justice\nto his patron. He paid frequent visits to Fontainebleau and the\nLouvre, and even desired a friend to inquire if he could not obtain\nreproductions of the frescoes at Herculaneum and Pompeii. In spite of\nall this elaborate preparation, the subjects were not such as appealed\nto his genius, and in spite of them being well and soundly painted, we\nare told that they presented no features which called for special\ncomment.\n\nHe found, however, a much more genial occupation in accomplishing a\nseries of drawings ordered by a Monsieur Gavet, who paid the artist\n1000, 700, and 450 francs each, according to their size. He made\naltogether ninety-five drawings in this way, and it is said that this\ngentleman had in his possession the finest work in black and white and\nwater-colour the artist ever executed.\n\nTowards the latter end of his life the death of dear relatives and\nfriends cast a sorrowful gloom over him. Amongst the latter Rousseau,\nwho expired in his presence on the 22nd of December 1867, was\nperhaps the loss which seemed to him hardest to bear. A staunch and\ntrusty friend, who was to be relied upon when his prospects seemed the\nmost hopeless, he had been one of the very few who had appreciated\nMillet's talents at their full worth, and who, moreover, scanty as his\nown means were, was ever ready to stretch out his hand to assist his\nstruggling friend.\n\nShortly afterwards Millet paid a visit to his patron, Herr Hartmann,\nat M\u00fcnster, and from here he went for a short time into Switzerland.\n\nUpon his return he devoted himself with great earnestness to work, and\nachieved a certain success at the Salons with his exhibits. The\noutbreak of the war with Germany caused him to migrate with his family\nto Cherbourg, where he thought he might continue to work, removed as\nfar as possible from the scenes of carnage and struggle which were\ngoing on farther east. Transported once more amongst the scenes of his\nchildhood, he felt an increased impetus to production, and when he\nreturned to Barbizon late in 1871, he brought with him a number of\ncanvases of the highest quality; conspicuous amongst them was the\nwonderful \"Gr\u00e9ville Church,\" now in the Louvre.\n\nThe anxieties of his troublous life were, however, beginning to show\ntheir effect upon his constitution; a persistent cough developed, and\nalthough an amelioration would occasionally occur, it was always\nsucceeded by a worse condition than before. His health suffered a\ngeneral decline, and he finally breathed his last on the 20th of\nJanuary 1875. He was buried in the little cemetery of Chailly, beside\nhis friend Rousseau, amidst the scenery they both loved so well.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE MAN AND HIS ART\n\n\nMillet is an instance of an artist working out his own destiny,\nimpelled by irresistible genius, in the teeth of seemingly\ninsurmountable obstacles. He started life with enormous disadvantages;\nwithout friends in influential circles to spread his fame or plead his\ncause; without money to enable him to outlive and triumph over the\nignorant fanaticism of critics and artists, so soaked in the\nconventionalised art of their time that they had not perception enough\nto appreciate the full meaning of that naturalistic movement, which\nwas finally to sweep away the quasi-classic art they boasted of with\nsuch bombastic effusion. The path was hard and thorny, and his triumph\nwas not finally consummated until after his death. He himself found\nhis only satisfaction in the fact that he had lived his life according\nto the dictates of his genius, and had achieved the maximum of which\nhe was capable.\n\nMillet and our own Cotman were somewhat kindred spirits; there is much\nmore affinity between the work of the two men than is apparent to any\none who has not closely studied them. The marvellous \"Breaking the\nClod,\" now happily permanently housed at the British Museum, betrays\nthe same tremendous conception and broad outlook which characterises\nmany a drawing of Millet's. Both highly strung to a painful extent,\nthey were each conscious of their inability to curb the power which\nprescribed a certain course for them, and in spite of pecuniary\ndifficulties and unpopularity, an inevitable result of their intense\noriginality, they pursued a steady course to the end of their lives.\n\nThe socialistic doctrines which have been read into the work of Millet\nare rather the outcome of the world's uneasy conscience being brought\nface to face with a crushing indictment of existing conditions, than\nof any design on the artist's part to further the cause of a political\npropaganda by means of his art. This somewhat extravagant reading into\nhis art has certainly been carried to excess. Particularly has such\nbeen the case in America, where a large number of his finest works are\nat present to be found, curiously enough in the hands of enormously\nwealthy people, who are frequently perhaps the least able to\nunderstand the real meaning of his message.\n\nComing from a peasant stock, his sympathies were always with the\npeasant; it was the only class he understood or cared for. He lived as\none of them, and shared to a large extent in their labour. He has been\ndesignated, not inappropriately, the philosopher in sabots. Rightly or\nwrongly he has come to be looked upon as one of the high priests of\ncommunistic doctrines. Few pictures have been so anathematised as the\n\"Man with the Hoe,\" and perhaps none have done more to inculcate\nsympathy with the degradation of the lower orders of the human race.\n\nThe revolting brutality and vacancy of that face haunts the\nimagination. Is it possible that fellow-creatures so utterly debased\nby toil and neglect exist? Millet dispels any doubt upon the question\nby bequeathing to humanity this trenchant portrait. By no means\nlimited to Barbizon or France, these poor creatures exist in every\ncountry, and curiously enough are considered an essential element in\neach country's development.\n\nThis poignantly human note is observable in almost every work Millet\nwrought; his passionate sympathy with his fellow-man is the keynote of\nhis art. The wood-cutter in his arduous toil, the shepherd in his\nsolitariness, the labourer turning the soil with unvarying and\nlaborious monotony, the mother caring for her children--all carry the\nsame message for him of that strange and incomprehensible mingling of\njoy and sadness we call life. Like many great minds before and since\nhis time, our artist found the greatest joy in life in a placid and\nnever changing melancholy. But the peasants he chose knew nothing of\nthe sadness he saw in them. Completely inured to their toil, and\nsubdued by it, with no refining or uplifting influence to stimulate\nthem, they knew nothing, aspired to nothing beyond what they were; it\nwas left to Millet to supply the \"might have been.\" He saw the inky\nblackness of the mind of the \"Man with the Hoe,\" the pathetic\ninequality between the mounted farmer directing the safe storage of\nhis crop, and the stooping figures of the \"Gleaners\" eager to scrape\nup the miserable crumbs which had fallen from the rich man's table. He\ntraced the lives of these simple folk until we arrive at the grim and\ngaunt figure of Death, who, as he grasps the woodman by the shoulder,\nreminds him that his course is finished and that he, in common with\nall his fellow-men, must enter the great unknown land from which there\nis no return. It is a sad and melancholy art, vibrating with purity\nand truth, the outpouring of a great soul yearning to express itself\nto the utmost of its power. The mind and character of the man can be\nread in every line and in every touch of the brush. His drawings and\netchings are even more searching in their virility than his pictures.\n\nThere is a spontaneousness about them we search for in vain in his\nwork in oil and pastel. In black and white his intensely emotional\nmind found a swift method of expression; in the laboriousness of oil\npainting he was fettered with the complications of the medium. It can\nbe fairly said that only in one or two paintings--a notable example\ncan be cited in the wondrous \"Sawyers\" at South Kensington--does he\nrise to the height of a great painter. Millet was a poet, a\nphilosopher, a great thinker, and the means he chose for expressing\nhimself were those which were best fitted to his purpose. His\npredilections in art were concentrated upon the greatest, and\nconsequently the men who appealed to him were the thinkers of the\nages. Mantegna and Correggio, Michel Angelo and the mighty Greeks,\nthese were the masters who left their impress upon his mind and art.\n\nThe influence of so sincere and profound an artist has necessarily\nbeen profound. He has moulded men who have achieved world-wide fame;\nSegantini, for example, would never have risen to the heights he did\nhad the example of Millet not been ever before him. There have been\nmany who, without possessing his genius, have endeavoured to follow\nin his footsteps, but successfully as his imitators have sometimes\ncaught his style, their productions can never live alongside his,\nbecause they lack the real ring of sincerity.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n        a. One bed, or folding cot,\n        b. One oil stove,\n        c. One lamp,\n        d. Enough supplies of all kinds sufficient for six months,\n        e. Pots, pans, kettles, etc.\nIt is needless to say that positions in Manila and Iloilo were now at\na premium.\n\nWas it possible that teachers were to be sent to places where even the\nnecessaries of life could not be obtained! Was it possible that many\nwould be sent to places so remote that for six months no fresh\nsupplies could be gotten! A mass meeting was held at once, and a\ncommittee was appointed to send a cablegram to the Associated Press\npetitioning aid from the American people at large. Realizing what\nconsternation would be created throughout the United States by such a\nmessage, two of the teachers leaped into a carriage at the close of\nthe meeting and a few moments later were closeted with the chief\nexecutive of the department. As a result the committee was persuaded\nnot to send the cablegram to the Associated Press until by courtesy it\nhad been sent to the President. Of course, this diplomatic move tided\naffairs over and the teachers who had flatly refused to budge from\nManila now agreed to go on to their stations, being assured that\nwhatever action was best would be taken.\n\nThe day had come when we must separate. We were to enter an untried\nand an unknown field. It was fitting that we have a final joyous\nmeeting, so the best orchestra in the archipelago was engaged and we\n\"chased the hours with flying feet\" until dawn so that whatever might\ncome to us in that unknown future upon which we were entering each\nwould hold in pleasant memory our last evening together.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER III. - A DRAMA IN ACTUAL LIFE.\n\n\nAlmost every one heeded the warning to go to his station forearmed\nwith at least necessaries of life, but, as it had never fallen to the\nlot of the writer to cook, he refused to learn at that late day, so he\ntook no pot, no pan, no kettle, putting his future into the hands of\nan uncertain fate and relying upon the unknown hospitality of the\nFilipino.\n\nBacalod, the capital of the province of Occidental Negros, was our\ndestination. The second morning after leaving Manila, we awoke with\nthe \"Kilpatrick\" lying at anchor in a shallow bay. We were several\nmiles from the shore and nothing in sight indicated that we had\nreached a place of any importance. Late the night before we had been\nawakened by the loud, sharp ringing of the ship's bells, accompanied\nby the reversal of the engines and a general disturbance awaking the\ncrew. So our first impressions on coming on deck were that we had run\naground. But the captain assured us that everything was ship-shape and\nthat this was the nearest point of approach to Capiz, a town of\nconsiderable importance on the island of Panay, where a body of troops\nwas to embark for home. Not even the grass hut of a native was in\nsight. Search as we would, not a sign was seen of a stream flowing\ninto the sea, indicating the probable presence of a town. There was\nnot a sign of life of any kind save one lone column of thin, blue\nsmoke that arose from the side of a mountain miles away. One would\nhave thought that we were explorers of three hundred years ago lying\noff the shore of some unknown land.\n\nAfter breakfast the steam launch, together with all the boats, was\nlowered, and several of us who had determined to miss no opportunity\nto gather information about the islands took our places in the launch\nby the side of the ship's mate, and steamed away across the water with\na long line of boats strung out in the rear. We headed away toward a\ngroup of cocoanut trees, and about an hour later stepped ashore on a\npile of decayed coral rocks that extended some twenty or thirty feet\nout into the water, thus forming the only landing place of a town of\nseveral thousands of people and of considerable commercial importance.\n\nA few moments after we had landed, an army wagon drawn by a\nmagnificent pair of mules came up out of a tropical jungle along a\nnarrow road. We clambered into the wagon and were soon lost in the\ndepths of foliage from which we had just seen the vehicle emerge.\n\nLong waving bamboos with their plumy leafage hung over the road from\neach side, meeting and overlapping in the center until they formed an\narchway so dense that the tropical sun now high in the heavens\npenetrated it only at intervals. At times the wagon sank up to the\nhubs in the soft earth, and the muscles of the mules stood out like\nwhip-cords under the skin as they drew us forward.\n\nAt a sharp turn in the road we came upon the first division of troops\nthat was to embark for home. The look of joy upon their sun-browned\nfaces was inexpressible. Their work was done, and with elastic step\nand smiling faces they saluted us as they passed by. The reign of\nforce was at an end; it was going out with them; the reign of peace\nhad begun; it was coming in with us.\n\nIn the afternoon when we returned from the town the last of the troops\nhad arrived and, as we drove up, the bugle was sounding the call to\nsupper. We noticed native women mingling with the troops and, indeed,\na native woman was in constant attention waiting upon one of the\nsoldiers with whom we ate. Her clothes were clean, her hair was nicely\ncombed, and her general appearance was neat. She seemed to anticipate\nthe slightest wish of the soldier with whom she was. She brought him\nwater to drink, cleaned his plate after the meal and saw that his\nknife, fork, and spoon were put into his haversack.\n\nWe had now finished supper and the launch had returned for the last\nload of troops. The lieutenant in command of the company gave the\norder to \"fall in\"; the men shouldered their rifles and fell into\nline. \"Forward, march!\" called the lieutenant, and the column swept\nforward towards the boats. The women had until now restrained\nthemselves, but, as their husbands marched away never to return, their\nfeelings could no longer be restrained. One young woman of about\neighteen, who was leaning against a rock by the roadside sobbing, when\nher husband passed, leaped up in frenzy of passionate love and caught\nthe rifle from his shoulder. Her first impulse seemed to be to throw\nthe gun away, but suddenly realizing the futility of such an act she\nburst into tears, shouldered the rifle herself and marched on by his\nside. Another woman of more mature age threw her arms around the legs\nof a tall stalwart man, and drew him bodily from the line.\n\nBut the troops marched on and entered the boats. One woman who had\nbeen unnoticed before came down into the shallow water and caught hold\nof our last boat as if to prevent its leaving, while others stood\nmingling their sobs with the sounds of the wavelets as they broke on\nthe sands. As we passed away, an expectant mother, standing in bold\noutline against the twilight sky, threw up her hands in an agony of\ndespair and then sank upon the stones. The curtain had fallen upon a\ndrama in actual life deeper in pathos than any other we had ever seen\nor ever expected to see. Depth of passion, depth of love! Who can\nfathom the human heart?\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. - WHAT THE TEACHERS DID.\n\n\nThere is a remarkable sameness about the towns in the Philippines.\n\nThey all have a large open square about the middle of the town, around\nthree sides of which are Chinese stores, unless one side lies open to\nthe sea, and on the fourth is the great stone ecclesia. The streets\nrun at right angles to one another and divide up the town into\ncreditable squares.\n\nEverybody in the Philippines lives up-stairs, for the ground is so\nsoaked with water during the rainy season that it is a menace to\nhealth to live upon the ground floor. So even the poorest nippa hut\nis built upon stakes four or five feet above the ground.\n\nBacalod is a typical Philippine town. As we landed, a broad open\nsquare was spread out before us. Two sides of the square were lined\nwith two-story houses in which were Chinese stores below and Filipino\nhomes above. On the third side stood the great stone church in whose\nmassive tower the clock was striking the hour of four, while the\nfourth lay open to the sea that had borne us thither.\n\nWe landed, but it was in a method new to us and one not usually\nemployed by the traveling public.\n\nWhen our sail boat ran aground on the sandy bottom a hundred yards or\nmore from the shore, a crowd of Filipino men who were on the beach\nslowly rolled up their pantaloons and waded out to the rescue,--for\nthe money that was in it. The boat's crew elevated their trousers'\nlegs also and slided down into the water. Each of us then straddled\nthe neck of a Filipino standing in the water and was held by ankles to\nbe steadied while our biped mounts proceeded to the shore.\n\nWe were now on the ground and face to face with the situation. To give\nthe reader an idea of the actual conditions met by the first teachers\nwho went to the Islands, the following is copied from the instructions\ngiven us in Manila:\n    1. There shall be two sessions daily of all schools, and the\n    last hour of the morning session shall be devoted solely to\n    instructing the Filipino teachers.\n\n    2. In cases where teachers are sent to a town in which there\n    is no school-house, they are expected to secure the aid of the\n    people and have one built.\n\n    3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is\n    stopped.\n\n    4. All supplies must be kept under lock and key. In towns\n    where there is no case or box to lock the supplies in, and it\n    is also impossible to get the town council to furnish a case,\n    a requisition may be sent to Manila, and, if an appropriation\n    can be secured, one will be made and sent out.\n\nThus it can be easily seen that we were indeed pioneers. In many\nplaces no school-house was to be found, and in some cases it was even\ndifficult to get the town council to provide a case in which to keep\nthe supplies.\n\nThe work of the teachers was, in short; to \"make the English language\nthe basis of instruction in the public schools.\" On our arrival at\nBacalod two schools were found in progress, for some soldiers had been\ndetailed for the work here previous to our coming. One of these was\nfor boys and the other, for girls. Thus the work here had been in a\nmeasure simplified, but complications that had arisen at Talisay, one\nof the largest and richest towns on the island, demanded a change of\nteachers and the writer was assigned to the place as superintendent.\n\nHere an attempt had been made to start a school but it had failed\nignominiously and a system of education was to be put into operation\nfrom the very start.\n\nThe Filipinos are not strong advocates of co-education, so separate\nschools were to be started for the boys and the girls. The one for the\nboys was gotten well in hand before the one for the girls was\nattempted at all.\n\nA few days after reaching the town and securing a home the\npresidente of the town had it publicly announced that the following\nMonday morning at eight o'clock a public school for boys would be\nopened in a building that had been rented for the purpose by the\nmunicipal council. About the middle of the afternoon of the same day a\nman beat a little drum throughout all the streets of the town to call\nthe people out and the town clerk announced both in Spanish and in the\nnative language that this public school would begin at the time and\nplace mentioned above; that instruction would be free to all who came;\nthat the government would furnish all supplies; and that instruction\nwould be given in the English language. A native principal and\nassistants were employed and everything was ready to begin.\n\nThe official report of the result is as follows:\n    Boys' public school of Talisay, Negros, P. I., began November\n    4, 1901. Forty-three boys present at eight o'clock. Forty-one\n    of them knew \"good morning\" and \"good afternoon\" but do not\n    know the distinction between them. Two of them speak simple\n    Spanish. At eight forty-five, eight more, who had been\n    attending an early morning private school, came in together.\n\n    The books they brought were so varied and so different from\n    one another that it seemed impossible to bring any reasonable\n    degree of order out of such a chaos, and so, after struggling\n    vainly for about a week with the problem, the superintendent\n    by one fell stroke removed everything in use and put in a\n    uniform system, and from that day on the English language has\n    been the basis of instruction in the public schools of\n    Talisay. The work was of necessity very slow at first, but by\n    the end of a year two schools were going nicely and a number\n    of the brightest boys and girls had made really excellent\n    progress.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER V. - A \"BAILE.\"\n\n\nNot long after the arrival of our party at Bacalod we received an\ninvitation to a \"baile\" given in our honor by the inhabitants of\nSilay, a town some ten or twelve miles up the northern coast and one\nnoted for its social life. The invitation was accepted with pleasure,\nand about the middle of the afternoon on the day appointed we were\nclad in the immaculate white of the tropics and steaming away up the\ncoast on board a launch sent for our conveyance. Twilight was still\nlingering on the path of day when we anchored just off shore at the\ntown. A row-boat containing the officials of the city came out to meet\nus and, in due season, we were ushered into a spacious drawing-room\nfilled almost to overflowing with the \u00e9lite of the town. The \u00e9lite of\ntowns in the Philippines speak Spanish, and, as only one or two of our\nparty could at that time boast of more than a formal acquaintance with\nthe Castilian tongue, the exchange of ideas that evening between us\nand the Filipinos was of necessity not very rapid.\n\nThe necessity of easy communication between us was rendered somewhat\nless indispensable by the announcement of supper as soon as we were\nrested from our trip. When we had taken our places at the table a\nyoung Filipino about twenty-five years of age arose and gave a lengthy\ntoast to the recent union of the Philippines with the United States.\n\nBut as we Americans were unable to scale the dizzy heights of his\nclimaxes or sink to the depths of his pathos, we forewent the\npleasures of his oratory and turned our attention to the savory odor\nof lamb, chicken, and roast pig that came slyly stealing up our\nnostrils to send us nerve dispatches about the gastronomic delights of\nour not far distant future.\n\nAt last the toast was ended and the world-wide soup ushered in a long\ntrain of things good to eat, served in a style better fitted to the\ndelights of the appetite than to the formalities of dinners, for, as\nsoon as the pleasant task of one dish was completed by any one, the\nnext was served him at once regardless of the progress made by the\nothers at the table.\n\nThe last course was dulce. The new-comers to the Philippines will\nnot be long in making the acquaintance of this dish, and at all\nmeetings, both public and private, where eatables are served, it\nperforms an important part. It is anything sweet, and it may vary all\nthe way from an india-rubber-like black mixture of cocoanut milk and\ndirty sugar to a really toothsome and respectable confection. No\nmatter of what materials a dish is composed, just so long as it is\nsweet, it is dulce.\n\nAfter paying our respects to this last course, we arose from the table\nand entered a great rectangular room from the center of whose ceiling\nhung a large glass chandelier, a mass of shimmering crystals. In the\nchairs around the room were the wealth, the youth, and the beauty of\nthe town.\n\nThe first and also the last number of every Filipino dance of any\nformality is the \"rigodon.\" The dancers are arranged in a square, or\nquadrangle according to the number participating, and are then led\nthrough a tangled maze of figures that so utterly bewilders the novice\nthat he sinks into his chair at the end of the dance wondering how it\nall came to pass.\n\nWe Americans breathed a sigh of relief when the \"rigodon\" ended, and\nmustered fresh courage for social conquests in the waltz that was now\nbreathing forth from the trembling strings. My companion in the first\ndance had been the young lady by whose side I had sat at dinner. But\nit now became necessary to search for another, so I prudently waited\nto see how partners were chosen, and made no mistake when a few\nmoments later I faced one of the most luscious looking se\u00f1oritas on\nthe opposite side of the room and offered her my arm. My eyes must\nhave told the story that my lips could not utter in Spanish, for she\nsmiled upon me sweetly, arose, and put her hand upon my shoulder. My\narm encircled her waist and I began to waltz. Unfortunately my\ncompanion did not follow, but began to hop up and down in a manner\nmost distressing. Supposing the attack to be only temporary, I paused\nand, much to my relief, she soon showed signs of recovery; and in the\ncourse of time she came to a standstill looking up into my face in an\ninquiring sort of way, apparently wondering why St. Vitus had not paid\nhis respects to me also. A second attempt to follow the music met with\nresults similar to the first, and during the third attempt, which\nseemed to be trembling on the verge of a failure, St. Vitus let go my\ncompanion and seized me with such vigor that she, who was small even\nfor a Filipino, was gathered up bodily and taken around the room at\nsuch a pace that her toes touched the floor only at far distant\nintervals.\n\nAt this point my devotion to the shrine of Terpsichore ceased from\nforce of circumstances and I seated myself in one of the most\ncomfortable chairs in sight that I might carry out a previously formed\nplan to study the Filipino somewhat critically as he appears in\nsociety.\n\nThe first thing that impressed me as the dancers passed up and down\nthe room was the flash of diamonds. Nearly every woman in the room had\non a brooch that flashed the colors of the rainbow at every turn.\n\nAlmost all of them wore one or more rings that showed up brilliantly\nunder the chandelier. Many of the men too, especially the young men,\nwore gems that appeared to be exquisite. A closer inspection showed\nthat some of the gems had flaws and others were of a poor color, but\nno one would have denied that, taken as a whole, it was a really\nbeautiful display.\n\nThe dress of the ladies was richly colored. Many of their skirts were\nof silk covered with hand embroidered flowers, and their filmy pina\nwaists and broad collar pieces were rich with needle-work. They all\nwore a kind of heelless velvet slipper, very common as a dress shoe in\nthe Philippines, or high-heeled patent leather shoes with neatly\nfitting black stockings.\n\nThe men were dressed in white coats and white pantaloons or black\ncoats and white pantaloons. White shirts and collars, together with\nall sorts and styles of cravats and low-cut patent leather shoes with\nhighly colored socks completed their dress.\n\nIt was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money;\nthat they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a\ntable loaded with good things was a fact to which all of us were\nenthusiastic witnesses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VI. - A SKETCH OF LIFE IN THE PHILIPPINES.\n\n\nHouse-keeping in the Philippines presents some interesting phases. Our\nclub of American officials decided to run a mess, so we employed a\ncook and a house boy, then each of us provided himself with a personal\nservant, making a total of six servants for four men--it takes about\nthis proportion of servants to live in any sort of comfort in the\nPhilippines--and launched ourselves boldly upon the sea of domestic\neconomy. But there were shoals ahead of us, for the question of\nregulating servants is one of no small importance in the Philippines,\nand one of its most disadvantageous features is the long chain of\ndependents that usually attends it.\n\nWe gave the cooks so much a day with which to buy supplies in the\nlocal market, for our own table, making him render a daily list of\nexpenditures, and a fixed amount besides to purchase rice and fish for\nhimself and the other servants. Of course, if they wished to vary\ntheir diet and get chicken and fresh pork, which could be had at far\ndistant intervals, it was wholly a matter of their option, but the\nallowance was made on the basis of so much rice and fish a day for\neach. This allowance was about fifteen cents a day in Spanish coin per\nservant.\n\nThus far all was well. We had agreed to give the cook eight dollars a\nmonth in Spanish money, thinking that good wages would procure good\nservice, but the visions of affluence that floated before him on such\nfloods of wealth were so alluring that they drew him from the kitchen\nto the cooler veranda. In less than a week he had employed an\nassistant at four dollars a month; in less than another week that\nassistant had employed him an assistant at two dollars a month; in\nless than another week that assistant to the assistant had employed\nhim an assistant at the princely salary of fifty cents a month; and\nfrom fear that the chain of dependents would end only by our having\nthe whole Filipino race attached to our culinary force, we broke up\nhouse-keeping and went boarding again, choosing that as the less of\nthe two evils.\n\nOur house furnishings were almost wholly Philippine. The table ware\nand the food on the table came from the ends of the earth. The knives\nand forks were made in Germany, the plates were manufactured in\nEngland, the glass ware and table cloth, in the United States. The\noatmeal and flour came from the United States also. The butter came\nfrom Australia, the rice from China, the salt from Russia, and the\nother eatables from sources about as various as their separate names.\n\nSwitzerland furnished the condensed milk and Illinois the canned\ncream. Nearly all of the canned fruit bore labels from Spain.\n\nThus it can easily be seen that life in the Philippines, if lived\naccording to American ideals, is dependent upon a highly developed and\nhighly complex commerce. However, the difficulties of transportation\nand the restriction of large stocks of merchandise to Manila and some\nhalf a dozen other towns, make so great a difference between country\nlife and city life that a short comparison of the two will not be out\nof place, and life in Manila may well be taken as being fairly typical\nof the latter.\n\nLife in Manila is pleasant, but expensive. It is pleasant from the\nfact that it is not only the capital but also metropolis of the\narchipelago. Thus the combination of wealth and high official position\nhas given to Manila a society of the highest and most refined type.\n\nThe process of beautifying and improving the city which is constantly\ngoing on bids fair to give us at no distant day a city of which we may\nwell be proud.\n\nBut let him who intends living well in Manila on a small income bid\nfarewell at once to so idylic a dream, for it costs much to live well\nthere. In the city of Manila one can get almost anything he wishes,\nbut it must be paid for at the price it commands. Especially in the\ncase of eatables, this price is by no means small, because to the\nfirst cost of articles must in most cases be added the expense of\ndistant shipment from American, European, or Australian ports, and not\ninfrequently the cost of long refrigeration must also be taken into\nconsideration. But, expensive though it is, it is very pleasant to\nlive there and those who have once enjoyed it often wish again to\nquaff the cup of its delights.\n\nIn strong contrast to this pleasant life is the life of the quiet\nlittle hamlet away in the distant islands. Indeed, the Filipino from\nthe distant town, who by some good fortune has been to Manila, or, by\na coup de main, has studied in one of the Manila colleges, is looked\nup to in a true hero-worshiping attitude by all who either know him or\nhear of his fame. Life in such a place is one long state of harmless\ninactivity. Not a wave of trouble from the great outer world ever\ndisturbs its peaceful repose. One lounges forever in an air of\nindolent ease and extreme aversion to anything approaching what might\nbe called a respectable effort.\n\nOne arises in the morning about the time the sun's first rays silver\nthe top leaves of the cocoanut trees and then stirs around until nine\nor ten o'clock, when it is found expedient to avoid a further exposure\nto the sun. From then until about five o'clock in the afternoon it is\nbest to take things as they come, even though one of those things be a\nFilipino dinner. But then you may have your vehiclo attached to a\nyoung bull with a ring in his nose and go for a drive. If it is the\ndry season you will probably enjoy the drive unless you object to the\nfrequent clouds of dust swept along by the evening wind. If it is in\nthe rainy season your pleasure will depend to a considerable extent\nupon how wet you get; but, whether the season be wet or dry, your\npleasure will be regulated largely by the state of harmony existing\nbetween the driver and the bull.\n\nIn these quiet secluded nooks successive generations of Filipinos are\nborn, reared, grow old and die in an even chain of events broken only\nby the occasional erection of a new grass house on the identical spot\nwhere its predecessors have stood for ages. The son lives in the house\nof his father, cultivates the same few square feet of soil planted in\nedible roots, climbs the same cocoanut trees, follows the same winding\npath down to the stream, pounds rice in the same mortar and with the\nsame stick that his ancestors have used from time unremembered, and,\nin case of illness, curls up on a grass mat in a corner of the room\nuntil he dies or by some good fortune recovers. Beyond this narrow\nhorizon he never looks. So narrow and contracted is the life that the\nlanguages of two towns a few miles apart are so different that one\nwould scarcely recognize them as belonging to the same race of people.\n\nSuch are the two extremes of life in our new far Eastern provinces:\nthe one is active, progressive, and cosmopolitan; the other, inactive,\ndecadent, and narrow; but, whether one enjoys the first or endures the\nsecond, there comes to him after leaving a longing to lounge again in\ntropic airs and listen to the lullaby of the winds among the palms.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VII. - THE FILIPINO AT HOME.\n\n\nAs one enters a Filipino sitting-room for the first time, there is one\nfeature in the arrangement of the furniture that impresses itself upon\nhim at once, and it may be stated without fear of serious\ncontradiction that this same peculiar feature in its arrangement will\ncontinue to face him, as he enters different homes, about as certainly\nas he crosses the threshold.\n\nThe arrangement referred to is that of one large mirror, one settee,\nand some ten or a dozen chairs that appear to have had a certain\norderly affection for one another. The mirror is hung upon one of the\nlarge interior parts of the house about four feet above the floor. The\nwooden houses in the Philippines are built by setting large posts\nupright into the ground, extending into the air from twenty to thirty\nfeet. Cross timbers are fastened to these upright posts about eight or\nten feet above the ground and then not sawed off even with the posts,\nbut allowed to extend beyond them each way. The framework of the house\nis built upon these extending cross timbers, a style of building by\nwhich these large upright posts are left standing out on the inside of\nthe room from one to three feet from the walls. It is on that one of\nthese posts most nearly opposite the door that the mirror always finds\nits place. Immediately beneath the mirror is the settee; and the\nchairs are arranged in two parallel lines facing one another and at\nright angles with the ends of the settee. However odd this arrangement\nmay appear to one when he first enters a Filipino drawing-room, there\nare two things to be said in its favor. In the first place, it places\nyou face to face with the person with whom you are conversing so that\nyou can watch him,--a matter of no small moment in the Philippines. In\nthe next place, it enables you to give one of the young ladies a\nsheep's-eye in the mirror while the others present are left where\nMoses was in our much abused conundrum.\n\nThe size of the residence and the quality of its furnishings depends\nupon the wealth of the owner. But there is so vast a difference\nbetween the mode of life of the highest class and the tao, or lowest\nclass, that it is well to speak of them separately, and the great\nmiddle class of Filipinos can easily be imagined to occupy the\nintervening ground.\n\nThe rich Filipino's house is usually of wood built upon a wall of\nstone or brick from ten to fifteen feet high. The floors are kept\nhighly polished in his hallway, dressing-room, and bed-rooms. There\nare, of course, no fire-places in any of the rooms, but on some\noccasions something is needed to dry the rain-soaked atmosphere, for\neven in the dry season it has been seen to rain for five successive\ndays and nights without the cessation of a moment.\n\nA long chain of dependents is attached to the household of the rich\nFilipino. The master has his special body servant to be present at all\ntimes to do his master's bidding, in short, to be the visible\nmechanism of his master's volition. So, too, the lady of the house has\nher servant woman to do the slightest bidding of her ladyship. Then\nthere is the cook who is almost invariably a man, a house boy or two,\nand the coachman. These functionaries, with their assistants and\nassistants to the assistants, together with a servant or two for the\nexclusive service of the children, complete the economic household.\n\nSuch a family has an abundance of rice and wheat bread, also of\nchicken and fish with occasional fresh beef. They have also a good\ndeal of dulce. They regularly serve wine and frequently serve beer\non their tables.\n\nIn strong contrast with this mode of life is that of the tao. His\ndiet consists almost wholly of rice and small uncleaned fish boiled\ntogether. As a rule knife, fork, plate, and spoon find no place in his\nhousehold. The rice and fish are boiled in a pot and then allowed to\ncool in the same vessel or poured out to cool in a large earthen or\nwooden bowl. Then Mr. Tao together with Mrs. Tao and all the young\nTaos squat on their heels around the mixture and satisfy that\nintangible thing called the appetite. They do not use chop sticks as\nthe Chinese do, but the rice and fish are caught in a hollow formed by\nthe first three fingers of the right hand. The thumb is then placed\nbehind the mass. It is raised up and poised before the mouth, with a\nskill coming from the evolution of ages, when a contraction of the\nmuscles of the thumb throws the mass into the mouth with a skill that\nis marvelous to any but a Filipino. To judge from the most reliable\ninformation, the poorest class do not have an abundance of food,\nalthough it would seem that such a condition of things would be\nwell-nigh impossible. However, in a census of one hundred school\nchildren there were found six boys and four girls who declared that\nthey had never had enough to eat, and the native teacher stated that\nthis was probably true.\n\nThe wide gulf between the tao and the rich man is filled by the\ngreat middle class of Filipinos.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER VIII. - VISIT TO A LEPER COLONY.\n\n\nNot far from our town was a leper colony and the first Saturday that\ncould be spared was set aside for a trip to the place. It happened\nthat none of the other Americans were at leisure on this particular\nmorning, but, rather then delay the trip or miss it altogether, the\nwriter, armed with a revolver, started out alone.\n\nThe road had been described so accurately by one who was supposed to\nknow it that it was deemed well-nigh impossible to miss the way. The\nmain highway was followed to the point where the by-path supposed to\nlead to the settlement turned off through some bamboo thickets and a\nlow tropical wood. This path led straight away towards the sea-coast\nwhere the houses of the colony were said to stand in a cocoanut grove\nby the beach.\n\nUpon arriving at the settlement, a very inhospitable reception was\nreceived from a mangy cur that growled and showed a very uninviting\nset of sharp, white teeth behind his snarling lips. The growling of\nthe dog had attracted the attention of an old man who, with age-bent\nback, was pounding rice in a mortar about fifty yards away. He turned\nslowly around and, upon seeing an intruder into the primitive quiet of\nthe place, gave a sharp, far-reaching call. The sound had scarcely\nrung through the grove when from about a dozen of the little grass\nhouses dotted here and there fifteen or twenty men armed with bolos\ncame out and gathered around the old man. A sense of my danger flashed\nupon me. Three miles from town and alone in a tropical jungle, I could\nbe almost instantly overcome by this band of bolo-men, and the only\nreport that would ever reach my people would be that I had\n\"disappeared.\" Of course, attack was by no means certain, but the\npotentiality of the situation was thrilling. A drawn revolver and the\ngleaming of its shining barrel had the effect of stopping the men, who\nseemed to be hesitating as to a course of action, until a somewhat\ndignified retreat was made to an open space in the rear from where a\nless dignified and a more hasty retreat began which did not stop short\nof Bacalod.\n\nEnough had been seen, however, even in this short visit, to give\nconvincing proof that the settlement visited was no colony of lepers;\nso, that afternoon two servant boys being taken as guides and\ninterpreters, another attempt was made to reach the goal desired.\n\nThis attempt was successful, and, after about two hours of walking, a\nlittle cluster of grass huts snugly hidden by the sea-coast came into\nview. As we approached, one would have thought it a gala-day. Some few\nchildren, apparently from six to thirteen years of age, almost wholly\nnude, were romping and playing in the open space around which the huts\nstood, and no one would ever have thought that any cloud so horrible\nas leprosy could hover over a place apparently so happy.\n\nBy the side of the path as we passed was a man and his wife setting\nout potato plants. His hands were so puffed and his fingers so short\nthat he could scarcely use them, but he was working along as best he\ncould. His wife's feet were so swollen and twisted that she walked\nonly with the greatest difficulty. We passed them by and entered the\nopen space above referred to.\n\nThe children now saw us, and those of them who could darted away like\nfrightened rabbits, each to his own burrow. An old man who was sitting\nin the warm afternoon sun on the little bamboo platform before his hut\nwas aroused from his lethargic repose by the scampering away of the\nchildren. He arose, trembling upon his tottering limbs, all drawn and\ntwisted, and hobbled away into his hut.\n\nThe children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at\nthe doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of\nthe settlement. In a few moments we were surrounded by a circle of\nhuman beings at once so repulsive and so pitiable that its graphic\nvividness can never be accurately portrayed.\n\nThe old man referred to above, having put on a pair of snow-white\npantaloons, appeared now at the doorway of his hut, followed a few\nmoments later by his wife who had evidently clothed herself in the\nbest raiment she had. At a call from the old man, all the men, women,\nand children in the settlement came out of their huts and stood in a\nline before us. The old man was spokesman and in his native visayan\ntongue made a heart-rending appeal for aid which we were powerless to\ngive. Attention was called to a leper woman, apparently about\ntwenty-five years of age, whose face had been attacked by the disease\nand whose appearance was truly pathetic. Upon her hip was a child\nabout a year and a half old and, strange to say, the child showed as\nyet no signs whatever of the disease.\n\nWhat an indissoluble enigma is life! Here in a little cluster of grass\nhuts in a secluded nook of a secluded island of an all but secluded\narchipelago was gathered together a little community of wretched\nnatives, driven by their loathsomeness from association with others\neven of the same half-savage race. Yet here, men and women loved and\nwere married, by mutual trust if not by law, and children were born of\nthe union to live forever under the unspeakable horror that\novershadowed the unfortunate parents. Love, hatred, sorrow, and\njoy--every passion that enters into the complex structure of the human\nheart even here, in this scene of sadness and despair, was playing\napparently as freely as where misfortune and disease had never crossed\nthe portals of life.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER IX. - A \"HIKE.\"\n\n\nWe were lounging lazily in our hammocks at Jimamaylan one evening in\nApril. Supper was just ended, and the soldiers in the post were\ncollected in groups here and there spinning yarns to pass away the\ntime, when a Filipino clad only in a loin cloth came down the street\nat a steadily swinging run and stopped in front of the sentry. He\nbrought the announcement that a band of ladrones had just burned a\nsugar mill and were advancing to sack a barrio about fifteen miles\naway.\n\nThe invitation of the commanding officer to go on a \"hike\" was eagerly\naccepted, and, in ten minutes after the message was given, the troops\nwere on the march followed by two adventurous pedagogues.\n\nDarkness was just closing in as we left the town, but a resplendent\ntropic moon soon made the night almost as brilliant as the day. The\ntrail we followed led over rough and rocky country. Sometimes for a\ndistance of a mile or more we passed over barren wastes of volcanic\nslag poured out in anger by some peak whose convulsions have long\nsince ceased. Again we would descend into a tropical jungle from the\ndense foliage of which the ladrones could have leaped at any moment,\nhad they known of our coming, and annihilated our little band. We\nforded rapid streams with the water at our breasts, and halted only\nonce in that rapid march of fifteen miles.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the town we met a man who was standing\nguard against a surprise by the ladrones. Nothing could well have been\nmuch more grotesque and nothing could much better illustrate the\nabsolutely primitive condition of the Filipinos in the interior of the\nislands than the appearance of this guard. A pair of knee pants, a\nconical grass hat, and a hemp shirt formed his entire apparel. A long\nflat wooden shield, a bolo, and a long bamboo spear with a sharp,\nflat, iron point, completed his equipment for battle.\n\nHere stood the first and the twentieth centuries side by side. The\nFilipino who had advanced only a stage beyond the condition of\nprimitive man with his knife, spear, and wooden shield, stood side by\nside with the American soldier, a representative of modern life with\nhis magazine rifle, his canteen, his knapsack,--with every article of\nhis clothing made to give him the highest possible efficiency as the\nunit of a military organization.\n\nA few yards farther on we met another guard equipped similarly to the\nfirst. Upon reaching the town, news had just been received that a\ndetachment of troops from another post had intercepted the ladrones\nand fought a skirmish with them. The ladrones had escaped and we set\nout in pursuit of them on a chase wilder than a Quixotic dream. We\nwound our way into the mountains behind the town, inquiring at every\ngrass hut we passed whether the band of ladrones had passed that way,\nbut only once was even a trace of them found. Then it was learned that\nat a certain place they had separated into groups of three or four and\ngone glimmering through the dream of things that were. This place was\nin a secluded nook of the mountains where in years gone by some\nadventurous Spaniard had erected a primitive water mill to grind his\nsugar-cane. We had now marched about twenty miles and the feet of the\npedagogues were a mass of blisters. They had reached the point where\nthat form of military maneuvering called \"hiking\" ceased to possess\nany alluring charms. So a native was persuaded to come out of his lone\nmountain hut and hitch up his carabao and cart. He was then made to\nget on the carabao's back, while the aforesaid pedagogues lay down on\nthe sugar-cane pulp that had been put into the body of the cart, and\nthe driver was instructed to start for the post we had left hours\nbefore, and not to stop until he got there. Being uncertain but that\nsome of the ladrones would learn of our having left the body of troops\nand would try the metal of our steel, we at first agreed that neither\nof us should go to sleep, but it was later decided that probably the\ndriver had no greater desire to cross the Styx than his passengers had\nand that in case of danger he would awaken us, so both took a revolver\nin each hand, stretched out supinely and went to sleep.\n\nSuch a sleep! The rough jolting of the cart over an almost impassable\nroad was never enough to break the spell of slumber. When we awoke the\nblazing tropic sun was past the midday mark of morning, shining full\ninto our unprotected and well-nigh blistered faces.\n\nA pack of dogs were heralding our approach to a little village at the\nfoot of the mountains where ponies were procured to take us back to\nthe post."
